" i bought this because i have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and i get tired of washing it. i thought i could use this every other day and get by. however it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok. it takes bed head hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while. after a couple of hours though my hair looks oily and stringy again. i use it before i take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning. then i end up washing my hair later ",negative
" i like jonathan anton & some of his products but this one was a very bad one. it smelled like swamp water. his other products smell great. i don't know what happened to this one. ",negative
" i bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses. there must be a quality control problem. my bottle had no noticible pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair. i was only trying to go 1 day without washing. what a disappointing product and a waste of my money. : ",negative
" after using this product i felt less than fresh. then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head. i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money ",negative
" i was again disappointed as this did not make me feel fresh. in fact if you mix it with the dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey - nothing fresh about it. ",negative
" i saw jonathan on qvc and was really impressed with the claim that the moisturizing conditioner was great for dry/damaged hair. he also said that his products don't strip the color out of hair like some of the brands on the market. i color and highlight my hair and wanted something that would protect it. what a disapointment. the conditioner bottle is horrible at dispensing even a small amount of conditioner. i had to remove the lid. then it's like paste...doesn't seem to go through the hair..even after 3 minutes. when i tried to comb my hair out it was like a birds nest. i had to put a spray leave in conditioner by another line in my hair just to comb through it. i ordered it from qvc...and it's going back ",negative
" jonathan conditioner is as good as a cheap drug store conditioner. jonathan you can only fool people into buying one bottle of the cheap stuff you can't fool them twice. i know we will all be seeing jonathan product on the clearence rack in a big lots with in a year or two ",negative
" i was very unhappy with the product! i was given the shampoo for christmas which when washing my hair made little to no suds. when trying to comb out my hair after shampooing it was like a bees nest and i couldn't possibly get a comb thru it. thats when i ordered the conditioner which was like cake batter and couldn't get it to come out of the container with really queezing it which made the lettering come off on to your hands and i found some in my hair. i squeeze and bang until i finally get a big lump coming out. i had watched all of jonathan's reality shows when he was working on creating his products and couldn't wait to try them because they are all natural. i am so disappointed! i recently saw his show back tv where someone calls him up and says they tried his product and how happy they were and jonathan gets all chocked up. i was screaming at the tv i was so upset. the product was not cheap and can't believe i can't use something i spent so much money on. ",negative
" on a scale of 1 to 5 the packaging gets a negative 1. you can't sqeeze the conditioner out of the bottle ended up removing top. for value of product jonathan gets a 1. for quality of product 3. the conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter. need to use more than average. the conditioner is average in detangling and after using it four times it does condition your hair but no better than other quality brands. i do like that it seems to cut down on the drying time but bed head has a similar product that's been out for a while. for that option i would rather choose bed head for quality and price ",negative
" jonathan should spent more time with scott from zorbitt because the packaging is second rate. the product itself was subpar also ",negative
" used along with shampoo theory my hair turned out worse than it ever had. not recommended at least for medium/wavy hair. no frizz control ",negative
" unless you have a new softball glove to break in this product is not for you. way way too much oil. just nappy. i might as well have put mayo in my hair. ",negative
" i had high hopes for this stuff. i have watched blow out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair but i cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. i have tried it on wet hair damp hair dry hair-no discernable difference. i will stick to my frederic fekkai products-they actually work ",negative
" i spent a lot of money on this product & waited with anticipation for it to arrive. when i applied it it did nothing to create curl and didn't even define the curls that i already had. my hair was limp and frizzy by days end. it smelled nice & that's about it. cheap-o suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl ",negative
" this hairspray was too wet and too stiff. it ruined my clean freshly washed hair and made my blonde locks stiff and darker - yuck!!!! i love the voluminizing shampoo & conditioner as well as the voluminizing foam - but when i lightly sprayed the finishing hair spray- it ruined everything. i will stick to an areosol hairspray instread of a pump. sorry jonathan : ",negative
" if you buy this shampoo buy something else with it to get this glue out of your hair. i guarantee you will be disappointed it is the equivalent of herbal essence. (also leaves your hair like glue ",negative
" this shampoo made my hair flat and dry when i used it every day.soi tried using another shampoo and used jonathan's once a week.the one day i used jonathan shampoo my hair was noticably flat and dull.i ended up throwing it in the trash and went back to my old shampoo.what a disappointment ",negative
" run as fast as you can... do not try! okay so i bought in to the hype of blow out. once i saw the jonathan product line on the shelf i thought hmmm how yummy! boy was i disappointed. the moisturizing shampoo was anything but! the product felt like a mixture of tree sap and glue. once applied to the hair i felt knots forming. upon rinsing my hair like it had been stripped! i used lots of the companion conditioner hoping for a balancing act but was left aghast when i rinsed and felt the new texture of my hair. i couldn't comb it out with a wide tooth comb until i applied a leave in conditioner from another product line! once dry my hair felt gritty brittle and generally nasty. i'm taking this stuff back and demanding a refund! i'm going back to my frederick fekkai products immediately ",negative
" watching the show i thought that jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. for example even in the hot very humid atmosphere of houston tx it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy even after using his conditioner (alot of it). my hair looks awful after using it. and the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like mea but it does use three different types of peg a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. this is just as harmful as mea especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. and it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the peg products. since peg is a thickener you're also getting a diluted toxic solution. even though head and shoulders uses mea i find that that even that works better than this. my hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and i've switched back to the other hair products iv'e been using. it's not worth your 20 dollars its barely worth 5 dollars. my hair stylist also recommended dove products if you need hydration. don't buy it! ",negative
" i used a sample and liked the fact that it cleaned my hair the way i want my hair cleaned. not washed with useless lather and coated with all kind of smoothening silicon products. people have beconme so used to the mass produced garbage that is sold in gorcery stores that they do not realize they are paying for detergent. in the long run it is damaging for the hair and after some hours it really does not have that nice clean bounce that hair is supposed to have. jonathan is not the only good product out there. i have been using phyto shampoo from france and kiehl's both don't have the silicon smoothers either and yes the hair does feel like straw right after you wash it. get a big tooth comb and some guts and go through life with really clean hair!!!! i used my sample and will buy a big bottle of the shampoo. i have not tried the conditioner but will try it too. ",negative
" is this shampoo or sap?? what exactly is it supposed to do?? i received a sample of this shampoo and i am ever so glad i got to try it free before i actually spent money on it. not only did my hair feel like straw as mentioned by other reviewers but it was so heavy i couldn't do anything except rewash it with my regular shampoo. i'll save this one for halloween. ",negative
" i see several previous reviews that acknowledge the fact that this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like straw yet say that is because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean! are you kidding me? if having clean hair means having my hair feel like straw and it does literally feel like straw then i'll happily return to having dirty hair...seriously i've had smoother softer hair from drugstore shampoos that cost .99 than this 20 dollar shampoo and conditioner! i could not even run a comb through my hair while it was wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough! i have rather dry hair and i merely tried this product on a lark just to see if it was any good because i am a fan of jonathan and his show so i will return to my drugstore shampoo dove and pantene which have always worked well for my dry hair. ",negative
" okay i'll admit. i bought into the hype. oooo no sulfates... oooo essential water.... oooo all natural - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - vegan shampoo and conditioner... i headed into the shower with confidence that i had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair. and what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely dessicant shampoo. and no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong! i tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results. after 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than i was i returned the product. this product truly deserves 0 stars!!

" i was excited to purchase jonathan product after watching two seasons of blow out. unfortunately i was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair. my hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess. unfortunately the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that's about it ",negative
" i purchased this item after seeing jonathan's show. as much as i enjoyed his program i am sorry to say that this product is just terrible. it weighed down my hair and made my hair look greasy before i was even done styling! the day after using the product my hair looked like an oil slick! i do wish jonathan much success but these products need a lot of work. very disappointing after spending almost 60$ for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard ",negative
" my naturally curly hair is thinning and i thought this conditioner would be helpful. the conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned. i thought it was too drippy. i nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand. i would not recommend this conditioner ",negative

" this product works well when i use it with a curling iron. the low rating is for the cost. i just don't think it is worth over $20 ",negative
" product made my hair sticky and gooey. i am a personal fan of his and it got rushed to market. needs re formulatin ",negative
" i have dried my hair daily for 20 years now. i bought the t3 tourmaline with great excitement. come on - its 200$ the most i have ever used on a hairdryer. i did not reduce my hair drying time at all but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny..but all in all- too much money for too little help! nor ",negative
" i'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. but i'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. most ionic and infrared is gibberish. tourmaline a gemstone has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated it develops a charge across the crystal) but that has nothing to do with hair drying or ionizing air or anything else. i'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam ",negative
" i have dyed red hair a lot of dyed red hair. this product made no noticable difference in the shine of my hair. will not purchase again ",negative
" i bought this lipgloss at my local sephora store. first of all..do not expect to see any plumping what so ever. it makes no difference in how your lips look. secondly it takes forever to get the gloss to come out on the rolly ball. the only reason this gloss is $18 is because of the too faced name brand. dont waste your money on this when there are lipglosses just as good/better for a few bucks at the drugstor ",negative
" i would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball. the roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out and you find yourself rolling it over & over again to get a decent amount of gloss. the gloss itself is pretty(once you get enough on your lips.) and it does taste & smell delicious. but it is way too much trouble with the roller ball. i would suggest they make this with an applicator brush. it would make a great product ",negative

" i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time because i have very thick wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten. it ended up taking just as long but the results were much better. my hair was super straight and shiny and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather. then when i was using it for just the 4th time it completely stopped working. just as other people described the red light shut off and it cooled down and never turned back on. i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now.

" i received this as a gift. i was thrilled with the results the first few times i used it. then the little red light went out while i was straightening my hair and it has never worked since. i only got to use it three times ",negative
" i bought this product at sephora. i had it for about two weeks and used it only 2 times. when i tried to use it after that the little red light wouldn't come on and it just wouldn't work. i took it back to sephora for an exchange since i was still within the 30 day exchange period. the second one worked for about two months...then the same thing happened. i was only using it maybe once or twice a week the most. this product is horrible. i never dropped it or anything like that. in fact as soon as it would cool down after using i would place it back in the box it came in. i am actually in the process of returning it to the manufacturer. honestly i wanted a good flat iron and i thought this was a good product because it was expensive...big mistake. my friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year. she also straightens her hair a lot more often than i do. i don't know why i didn't ask her where she got hers. please read all the reviews before you make this purchase. if you don't believe me wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is.

" i bought the tourmaline hoping to save time because i have very thick wavy hair that takes 45 minutes to dry and straighten. it ended up taking just as long but the results were much better. my hair was super straight and shiny and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather. then when i was using it for just the 4th time it completely stopped working. just as other people described the red light shut off and it cooled down and never turned back on. i'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now.

" i'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. but i'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. most ionic and infrared is gibberish. tourmaline a gemstone has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated it develops a charge across the crystal) but that has nothing to do with hair drying or ionizing air or anything else. i'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam ",negative

" when curious came out i smelled it and had to buy it. i acknowledged at the time that the bottle was probably half of the reason i bought it (unfortunately). the bottle is beautiful and attracts many customers by itself. the fragrance is very pretty and sweet. it goes on very strong but fades quickly which it annoying. also maybe six months after i bought it i noticed that it started smelling a little different. i left it in my bathroom for a while without moving it because of the difference. today i picked the bottle up and the sprayer was covered in this ....disgusting filmy substance which had also dripped down the sides of the bottle and created a ring of filth on my countertop. it was really really gross. by the looks of it the perfume had some sort of chemical reaction with the metal from the nozzle of the sprayer. anyways the whole bottle smells awful now and it's digusting. the bottle design was it's awful putrid demise which ruined $50. it's really unfortunate too because i loved the bottle and the fragrance when i got it and now it's junk ",negative

" never had i been so unhappy with my makeup as i was when i was using clinique. i used stay beige (which i lightly patted on my face on top of clinique's superfit liquid makeup - i have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. i also hated how clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades so that i had to settle for honey in the liquid and beige in the powder. as much as i went back to macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades they just wouldn't listen. either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade or they were convinced i was making a big deal out of nothing. instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which i shouldn't have to do in the first place) i just switched to a different makeup line: laura mercier which i am very happy with. i've had many other friends who were unhappy with clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand as well. i'm not trying to knock the product. i'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people i know. i would definitely not recommend clinique to anyone. i'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.

" i am so disappointed!!!!!!!!!!! i ordered this scent after hearing about it from friends and reading great reviews. all of the reviews i read mentioned the lack of staying power that this product has but i never expected the product to be so extraordinarily weak. don't get me wrong i do not want my fragrance to enter a room before i do (after all it is not the 80's anymore lol) but i also do not want to have to sniff my wrist so hard to detect the scent that i take off skin! the scent is beautiful i would love to wear it! but 20 minutes after i sprayed it on i could barely detect the fragrance. as sometimes it is harder to smell your own perfume i asked my hubby and friends for their opinions. they could barely smell it either. i would happily wear this scent every day if i could enjoy it at all. if philosophy can create this scent with staying power they will have a customer for life. as it stands now i would not recommend anyone buy this product. it is a very disappointing waste of money ",negative

" i purchased the entire 3-step clinique system including: clinique facial soap with dish clinique clarifying lotion 2 clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotion about the same time i started using the clinique 3-step system i began wearing foundation for the first time. i found that my skin started breaking out and began to be dry in some spots. i stopped using the foundation after about 3 months because i thought that was the issue. however my skin problems did not improve and i even moved down a level in the clinique system to one for more sensitive skin. however after about 7 months of daily use my skin was not improving and i found a review of the clinique 3-step system from paula begoun. her research indicates that all of clinique's facial soaps in the 3-step system are too irritating for all skin types. her research also stated that all clarifying lotions (1-4) contain alcohol and clarifying lotion 2 contains menthol which make them too irritating for all skin types. i never thought that my skin care products were the cause of my flaky skin and break outs. apparently the products dried out my skin making it flaky in some areas and in response my skin started producing more oil to compensate for the dryness-which made me break out in other areas. i switched to paula's choice facial products and i occasionally use cetaphil. after i made the switch my skin slowly began recovering. unfortunately now i have some acne scars on my cheeks as a result of using the clinique 3-step system. it makes me sad because before my skin was healthy and for the most part clear. i do want to be fair to clinique. they have some great products---i use their city block sheer spf 15 advanced stop signs eye spf 15 and i wear clinique happy perfume which smells amazing. i hope this review proves helpful to other women so you don't have to go through what i went through! clinique does have some great products in their line but they do need to reformulate their 3-step skin care system.

" the key to my heart lipgloss chain is a very cute original idea but it fails to deliver the quality worthy of the hard candy name. the reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty. all very true. i got my keychain in the pixie tones and they're girly and pretty and i was feeling pretty cool about it. however for me the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it. now i've always been a fairly careful person i'm not klutzy nor do i drop or lose things. my keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be i never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that's normal and yet after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice. the first time i was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition the second time however i only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because i saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo. how did it come apart like this? i honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse. i can honestly only chalk it up to really really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser-top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that. it was a good idea but too low-quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain. this is not the way to go for gloss on your keys ",negative

" although it is great others love this product i did not get that same streak of good luck. i had been using clinique for years merely because it was affordable and a lot of people i knew used it. however every time i took pictures i couldn't help but cringe after i saw the way my face looked. i'm a naturally tan person but when i wore clinique's foundation (i used honey 07) it would make my face look extremely pale and ghostly compared to the rest of my body. it got to the point where i got so upset that i went back to the clinique counter at macy's and insisted this just couldn't be the right color for me. they insisted it was the correct color and didn't even bother trying new shades on me even though i had gone back a couple different times. overall i was really miserable with this product. as a lady i want to look my best. i definitely don't want to look like someone who doesn't know how to put her makeup on but whenever i took pictures and saw the way i looked i couldn't help but think everyone was thinking that. for those of you who may be having my same problem i recommend switching over to laura mercier. i made the switch and it's been the best makeup decision of my life. my face has never looked better ",negative

" another disappointed customer. i have very thick coarse wavy hair and trying to manage it is a nightmare! before using fekkai's luscious curls lotion i was using aveda's be curly lotion and matrix's curl.life contouring creme. both of the latter products work very well with my hair. i don't like to blow dry my hair (too time-consuming) so i just air dry it. without blow drying whether i'm using aveda or matrix the results are great! my hair is smooth shiny and less frizzy. i had never used fekkai's products before but decided to give this one a try. everything luscious curl enhancing lotion claimed to do didn't do for my hair. in fact it actually made my hair worst! it became stiffer drier looking frizzier. in addition my wavy hair (usually bouncy and alive) became flat and dull. also i didn't like the scent of this particular curling lotion. it was very strong smelling and made me nauseous. because of my very poor experience with fekkai's luscious curls lotion i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. i think i'll stick to the aveda and matrix curling lotions since they are much more compatible with my hair.

" any manufacturer that doesn't fully label their product should not be trusted. i do not see a list of ingredients here (but most nail polishes don't bother to do this anyway). the problem i see is this...this nail polish totes that it's safe to use during pregnancy due to the fact that it doesn't contain the above ingredients but what does it contain instead? if it wears well doesn't peel give good color coverage it's got to contain something in the offending ingredient's place logically. please ask yourself this before you sigh relief and add to basket! phthalates for example are a class of industrial plasticizers that were invented in the 1930s. they are often used in nail polish because they make nail polish flexible and they are used in other products because they help bleed the chemicals of fragrances and help lotion better penetrate the skin. they aren't required to be labeled on the products. lab animals given dibutyl phthalate had higher numbers of offspring with birth defects especially of the male reproductive system. a nail polish may not contain phthalates (and brag about it) but may contain a related plasticizer that essentially is just as harmful. does this contain phthalic anhydride a toxic chemical hardener? how about fd&c color such as yellow 5? it's a petroleum-based color that is also questionable when it comes to safety. basically put no nail polish is safe during pregnancy. on top of that while your at it you should review every lotion foundation product etc that you use if you're concerned about things like this. i think it's great to be careful - more power to you - but be fully informed not partially. companies prey on our worst fears and what is worse than harming our babies? if this product is so great let's see an ingredients list (and all cosmetics should do the same while i'm sounding off on the subject!)

" as a huge fan of pink sugar and an avid chocolate fanatic i was ecstatic to try out chocolovers. since they don't sell chocolovers anywhere near where i live i decided to order it from sephora.com in the us. first of all i thought the price was fairly reasonable for 1.7oz bottle (a very nice bottle and package if i might add) it cost me around $50 cdn. i was so excited when my order came in today that i quickly opened up the bottle and gave it a sniff. ahhh the sickeningly sweet smell of disappointment. i don't know what i had been expecting maybe something more like milk chocolate but what i got was a strong citrus/cocoa powder burst fading into a very strong and sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries and chocolate with a hint of musk. this may sound good but for as much of a fan of sweet candy/foody smells as i am i found this one too overpowering and it seriously made me sick. right now all i can smell is a sickly sweetness and the smell of flat seven up. on the plus side it has stopped completely my cravings for sweets. i think if i were trying to diet i would wear this scent everyday. i think i will keep it in the hopes that it will grow on me because i really love the look of the bottle and the box it came in. i am also going to try and layer it with a cocoa body lotion in hopes that it will tame down some of the sweetness. the bottom line is try before you buy ",negative

" after having great success with the merkur classic i decided to own up and get the futur. i was super excited because i thought to myself shoot one pass instead of two... not quite. for starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy. and not the kind of heavy i'm comfortable with trying to shave as i shouldn't feel i might drop the darn thing. i started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor. not a good shave missed alot of spots and patches of hair. so day two i went to level 2 on the razor. same story second verse. it left patches and didn't shave well in some areas. 2.5 the areas got smaller but still...they were there. went to a 3 setting on the razor and almost mangled myself. so for the next week i went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly still gave me a crappy shave. i give this one star because if it's supposed to be a better razor than anything before it there shouldn't be a learning curve from one double edge to another. at least not one this severe. i get a way better shave using my merkur classic and i really think at least for me this is the way to go. i say use caution on the merkur futur. i also say if you're already getting a good shave with a double edge you have don't buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style. if you're double edge gets old...buy a new one of the same kind. only a suggestion.

" i bought this item because i heard it was waterproof and i was looking for something to wear swimming. i'm really not impressed. the one thing i will say for it is that the color blended well with my skin. in the bottle it looked like it would be way too dark so i was surprised by that. it looks like there might be a little wiggle room as far as choosing the correct shade with this one. the coverage is not very good though. you can put a little extra on without it looking cakey but it doesn't cover as well as say lancome's photogenic foundation. i also highly doubt that it is waterproof. water-resistant maybe. defintely not waterproof. it rubbed off pretty easily with a dry kleenex and even more came off with a wet one. when i tried coverblend's water resistant makeup i had to use soap to get it off. the coverage was also much better. unfortunately they don't offer many shades in the leg & body makeup. i also found that the dew finish did not work for my skin. i have combination skin and tend to have a shiny t-zone. this foundation left me with a shiny nose and forehead. it also made the rest of my face feel slightly oily which it normally does not. overall i would say this foundation is a very poor value and i will defintely be returning it to sephora. at least sephora has free returns. : ",negative

" never had i been so unhappy with my makeup as i was when i was using clinique. i used stay beige (which i lightly patted on my face on top of clinique's superfit liquid makeup - i have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. i also hated how clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades so that i had to settle for honey in the liquid and beige in the powder. as much as i went back to macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades they just wouldn't listen. either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade or they were convinced i was making a big deal out of nothing. instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which i shouldn't have to do in the first place) i just switched to a different makeup line: laura mercier which i am very happy with. i've had many other friends who were unhappy with clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand as well. i'm not trying to knock the product. i'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people i know. i would definitely not recommend clinique to anyone. i'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.

" clinique's exfoliating scrub is a facial scrub for oily skin. it is a thick white paste packed with medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than in clinique's 7 day scrub for normal skin. to use massage onto clean wet skin in a circular motion. rinse with warm water. careful not to get it in your eyes as i did once while rinsing it off in the shower. this scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin. but it's unsuitable for sensitive skin and it stinks to high heaven. it contains menthol which burns skin and clears the sinuses at no extra charge. having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing. of course it is 100% fragrance free according to clinique meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes. the scrub also contains salicylic acid so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types especially if used frequently. the performance isn't bad. the olfactory aesthetics are atrocious. this is the harshest most caustic facial scrub i've ever used. sensitive complexions beware ",negative
" i love clinique products and have used them for more than 20 years. the exfoliating scrub is convenient because it comes in a tube and rinses off easily.

" this product didn't work for me as described. first of all it does smell nice which is different from the usual fumes nail polishes give off! smells lemony! its also easy to use - you brush it on over nails and surrounding area let it set for awhile until it gets dull and then gently buff it off with a tissue. that was all fine and dandy but it didn't leave my nails all that dry nor did it leave them shiny. in fact they were less shiny than the shiny topcoats i use. i also had the worse case of bedsheet wrinkles embedded in my manicure that night after using this product - could be unrelated but i've never seen so many creases and smudges in my nails when i woke up and i let them dry for a few hours after painting them! i wouldn't recommend this product.

" i was looking forward to a lovely lavender scent when i got this soap but sadly that's not what happened. the smell is a very strong herbal; like the kind you would add to an italian pasta dish. not very appealing! there is some complexity to the scent but it's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through. on the plus side the color is beautiful (a rich dark purple) and the lather is equally lovely to look at. if you like true herbal scents then you should give this a try. it just wasn't for me.

" i am black american and have combination hair...nappy wavy and straight. i've been using drug store relaxers for over 30 years (crme of nature tcb dark & lovely revlon realistic) whatever is on sale with satisfying results. these products leave my hair evenly straight and shiny but hard and stiff immediately after the process. i usually wash my hair after a few days (i like to give it a rest after relaxing) and use a good conditioner to soften and detangle. from there i am able to go about 12 weeks before having to retouch. in general my hair is healthy and responds well to straightners. my biggest expense is with conditioning products to maintain my hair. i'll try anything and spend any amount if it works well on my hair. i have great success with frederic fekkai products and love phytodefrisant botanical hair relaxing balm...this stuff is amazing if you like to wash and go (air dry) and it works wonders with blow drying/flat ironing too. (bumble and bumble styling spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.) i forked out $60 to try phtyo2 after reading all the rave reviews. i am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away. yes phyto2 did not smell bad it did not burn my scalp and it did straighten my hair but no better than dark and lovely or tcb and my hair was still hard and stiff afterward. it has been several weeks and my hair is doing great but again no different from when i use dark & lovely. i guess i am lucky that my hair responds well to any type of relaxer so i doubt i'll be spending another $60 for phyto2...i'd rather buy two tubes of phytodefrisant balm and continue to with my $7.99 drug store brands. i hope this helps someone with similar hair as mine. if you do well with drug store brands phyto results are not that different...spend the money on their other products that nourish and condition your hair ",negative

" i got this bar based on the other reviews and boy is it strong! the bar will last a very good long while unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache. patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon. it was never supposed to be a stand-alone perfume! like all the lush bubble bars this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount. i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar (and it is a very big bar) and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong strong smell. i think the upside is that it seems like the scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually *in* the bath. or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just can't tell the difference anymore. so yeah if you love love loooooooove patchouli then this is truly the bath bar for you. otherwise i'd steer clear and go for something gentler. the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar in that it's really gentle on the nose. and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one. i love lush but not this bar ",negative

" i used this product this morning for the first time. i washed my hair blew it dry most of the way then rubbed the product in my hands and lightly distributed it throughout my hair. the best way for me to describe it is that it is like a creamy hairspray. yes it is tacky like hairspray can be but that's how it helps you get the style you want. what i like about how it works on my hair is that it really tamed the frizzes and brought down the big hair look that i usually have after blowing my thick hair dry. i think it would also work well on the days that i blow my hair out. i would probably blow it out first then apply some dirt to help tame and smooth it. i can see where it might make thinner straighter hair a bit limp so be careful not to use very much. edit: i think it is best to apply to slightly damp hair that might help with the people that are having trouble applying it to completely dry hair ",positive

" i just got this item (from ebay it's cheaper)and feel it's worthy of praise. i have thick straight hair and bought this product to wave my hair. i haven't figured out how it curls but to wave it's incredibly easy! grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w/o burning your hair like a curling iron would. also w/ a curling iron it's difficult to wave the top close to the roots. it heats fast! and comes w/ a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools. ",positive
" i had the chi turbo (1) but i got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable. so part of the reason i wanted to buy the t3 iron was that it comes with a 4-year comprehensive warranty. the other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are infused with tourmaline which i found intriguing. 1-3/8 wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair. (i've used a 2 inch wide iron which i found harder to maneuver.) it heats up fast and stays hot. it does a great job gripping the hair without snagging. my hair stays silky and straight all day and does not feel damaged after a while like it did with cheaper irons i've used in the past. another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls. it has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up). it creates a springy curl better than any flat iron i've used. (however the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch. so there is a drawback to this function.) overall i enjoy using this flat iron. very happy with this purchase. eta: i've learned that hairart will not honor the warranty unless you buy it from an authorized distributor (e.g. sephora). so you might want to check that before you place your order ",positive

" after watching blow out and seeing how passionate jonathan was about his product he sold me. anyone who is that determined to make the best product on the market obviously will do whatever it takes to make it happen. after seeing how much the product was i cringed at the fact that a bottle of shampoo would be that much. i later literally dragged myself to sephora to purchase this shampoo/conditioner after knowing that i was willing to take a risk that could eventually end up in my closet. i bought it went straight to my bathroom and washed my hair. the shampoo did not lather which i expected considering there is no harsh detergents or sodium lauryl sulfate. the conditioner was a very light thin substance. definitely not thick. finale-dried my hair and right there i knew that this product is definitely the best hair product by far that i have ever used. my hair is very damaged brittle and full of split ends. this product made my hair very very full full of shine and very soft. my hair was beautiful for days.... last test.. going to work. as soon as i put my hair down from a pony tail (i'm a waitress) instantly everyone noticed my hair. they asked what did you do?? your hair is soo beautiful.. i told them 40 dollar shampoo and conditioner well worth the cost. definitely a salon in a bottle. now my worst fear is that it will be discontinued for any reason. and if so i am willing spend 1k to stock up and save as much as i can. there is no other product like it ",positive
" after reading the other reviews i was a little worried about using the product i had already ordered. after using it for a few days now my hair has never looked better i truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner was meant for me. i have fine super straight hair middle to short. it feels clean and sleek. the conditioner smells like pina coloda yum! i would definatly recommend this for my hair type. would maybe recommend to lather the shampoo in your hands first then work thoroughly( it doesn't lather as well as some shampoos that have lots of glycerine in them) and only apply the conditioner towards the end of your hair and leave in for a few min. hope that helps ",positive
" i thought i was just going to have to put up with fly-away hair the rest of my life. this product is not for baby fine hair that goes limp when anything touches it. it's serious taming for seriously stubborn coarse or frizzy hair. mine falls into the first two categories. don't use too much! i use it after i've dried some of the moisture out with light blow drying then gently sweep it through my hair - even combing it gently in to reach every strand. for the first time in years my razor-cut layered hair is smooth ",positive
" like any other leave-in creme conditioner anything if you put too much of it on it will attract dirt. i know this because i have baby fine hair and had to model in the dry dry deserts in the middle of summer. needed anything leave-in to keep my staticy hair down. yes the more you use to more dirty you get....

" high beam is a nice subtle highlighter. however be sure to blend it very quickly and well or it will look unnatural in certain lighting (it'll look like you have pink nail polish on your face). it also has a tendency to emphasize pores. so only use it on areas of your face where you don't have any like on the top of the cheek bone and under your eyebrows.

" i don't know what the complaints about this product are. it seems that people are trying to use it for extreme hold hairstyles. this is not the purpose of this product. i use it for my short haircut to make the ends stay spiky and styled out and it works wonderfully. no matter how much you move your head it stays in place but somehow moves enough to keep you from having a stiff look. and when you brush your hair out at the end of the day it feels like you never put it in. hair stays soft and feels clean. the reason why this gel is thinner is that it isn't as sticky or goopey in your hair as other gels. and it spreads out easier ",positive
" i purchased a beauty water shower purification system and have used it about 5 times now with fantastic results. i have very hard water in my home and am tired of constantly having to blow dry my hair or having to use tons of products for it to be manageable and not frizzy. my hair felt very soft and manageable using this product and i am hoping it helps my highlights last longer. i did not experience that 'slimy' feeling people usually associate with soft water. i'm even able to let my hair air dry and not be frizzy with this product. i am curious to see how long this filter lasts. i called jonathan products and was told that they do have a replacement filter that costs $55 so you can save a bit of money when you need to replace the filter ",positive
" i watched blow out and figured the product was flying off the shelves because of the show's popularity. i ordered some because the ingredients sounded nice plus he did seem sincere when formulating etc. i have blonde hair color treated thick long lengths. i've bought high-end hair products for 20 yrs from beauty salons and stores and have never used anything that made my hair feel like jonathan product. you can immediately tell it's stripping and cleansing your hair. then the conditioner with it's exotic fragrance is the most wonderful conditioning treatment i've ever used. my hair looks cleaner and has more body than ever before with just shampoo & conditioner. i'll use it as long as it's available to me ",positive
" i absolutely love this hairbrush! i have curly hair and like to blow it out often and until now i have not been impressed with any brushes. this brush holds the hair in pace when blowing dry and also lets you move it with your hair and dose not hurt as some can or get stuck. you will not be sorry if you are looking for the perfect brush to go with your perfect dryer (the featherweight)! oh another thing i like is it extremely easy to keep clean. ",positive
" its pretty expensive for gel but i like it. my hair doesn't get rock hard like other gels and holds pretty well throughout the day ",positive
" its good for waking up because once you put it on you feel refreshed because your lips feel on fire.i like the sting and the shine of it. it finishes pretty fast and the roll ball may feel like a little drag to keep rolling on the lips but i think it's worth trying it unless you have extreme sensitive lips this stuff is strong. did i mention the great smell? yum! me and my boyfriend loved it. ",positive
" as a lip gloss addict i have easily over 200+ glosses. too faced fat kiss is by far one of my favorites. the superb shine makes my lips look so good! although it doesn't really plump it still tastes like cinnamon and it will warm you up in winter. i have two different colors because i like it so much! i strongly reccomend getting a couple so you can keep them in your purse make up bag car...everywhere! this rocks sooo much ",positive
" well i am very impressed with this. i also have tried so many different shampoos and this is one of the best if not the best i've used. i say that because whether i straighten my hair or leave it curly this shampoo makes it feel and look and smell great. it feels so nice and clean. i don't rinse twice with this because it's unnessesary. i tried this because of watching blow out and on my last trip to america i bought a couple of bottles. it's one of the best purchases i made. most girls buy shampoos etc based on packaging and smell and let me tell you not only does it look and smell great but what it does for your hair is amazing and apparently it's very low in damaging chemicals. i won't hesitate to buy more of jonathan's products next time i go. i love this and can't say enough about it ",positive
" very picky about shampoo and this a really good for dry color treated hair. i can tell it has made a difference ",positive
" this is the second product of jonathan's i've used and i'm equally happy with it. i have thin hair when it's straight and something in the middle when it's curly. either way i'd like it thicker and this foam certainly helps. it's great and i've found it does what it promises. it smells good and you don't need to use too much. it feels nice in my hair and the fragrance lasts most of the day. it doesn't matter if your hair is curly or straight hopefully you will find this as effective and as helpful as i have ",positive
" it has a clean soap smell! i also recommend the volume shampoo & conditioner it made my hair feel very soft ",positive
" i just got this item (from ebay it's cheaper)and feel it's worthy of praise. i have thick straight hair and bought this product to wave my hair. i haven't figured out how it curls but to wave it's incredibly easy! grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w/o burning your hair like a curling iron would. also w/ a curling iron it's difficult to wave the top close to the roots. it heats fast! and comes w/ a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools. ",positive
" i had the chi turbo (1) but i got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable. so part of the reason i wanted to buy the t3 iron was that it comes with a 4-year comprehensive warranty. the other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are infused with tourmaline which i found intriguing. 1-3/8 wide plates are the perfect width for my long-ish hair. (i've used a 2 inch wide iron which i found harder to maneuver.) it heats up fast and stays hot. it does a great job gripping the hair without snagging. my hair stays silky and straight all day and does not feel damaged after a while like it did with cheaper irons i've used in the past. another thing that this iron does that other irons do not do as well - it really curls. it has heat vents along the sides of the plates that lets you curl your hair by twisting it near the root and pulling it through (different from the usual method of gripping the ends of the strands and then winding up). it creates a springy curl better than any flat iron i've used. (however the heating vents make the exterior of the iron hotter to the touch. so there is a drawback to this function.) overall i enjoy using this flat iron. very happy with this purchase. eta: i've learned that hairart will not honor the warranty unless you buy it from an authorized distributor (e.g. sephora). so you might want to check that before you place your order ",positive
" i have been using the volumizing shampoo and conditioner for 2 weeks. i love this product! no build up no dandruf. make sure your hair is wet not just damp and you should not have a lathering problem. i purchased this from qvc and i will definately be a repeat customer. i have short hair so this will last me a while. i loved it so much i bought some for my daughter. this is my new shampoo ",positive
" i love the benefit line everything i have tried works great (not to mention they have great packaging and catchy names for all their products!). that said high beam is simply amazing. it only takes a little dab to add a nice glow/shimmer to my face. i especially like to use it on the cheek bones as it leaves a nice soft glow. high beam works so much better for me than other products i've tried that either left my skin sticky or chalky. not to mention those other products cost a lot more! if you are looking for a little glow a little shimmer high beam is the answer ",positive
" high beam provides a glow or sheen where as my cheeks seem dull. it does not look greasy...i would say it makes the skin look healthy and vibrant ",positive
" i recently discovered benefit products. this is a great product if you want to add a little glow to your skin. i use it to highlight my cheek bones. you can use it any where you want a glance to linger. the best thing about this product is the smallest amount makes a big difference in your skin. i suggest you try this product. it works wonders. ",positive
" this dry iron is absolutely amazing i really can't say enough about it. great for all types of hair! it heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time. plus your hair comes out extremely straight. highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours. it is an investment in your hair one of the better ones i've made. ",positive
" i am a big fan of this product. my hair is very strong. it needs a product which can keep it tamed. however most products that have that level of strength also come with high sheen or gloss which in my opinion is a bad look for today's fashions. the matte look is more flexible. american crew fiber gives me pliability and a matte look with a very strong hold. it also smells nice.... not to strong and not too girly ",positive
" i have been using this product for over 5 years as an alternative to gel or bed head. the results are great. no unwated shine no gooiness very easy to wash off. your hair wont feel stiff and wont get damaged. reasonably priced and more available every day. ",positive
" this is a great product for getting the bed head look. i can use approximately a dime size worth in my palms and go wild! trust me the results are great. if you apply too much you're hair will get oily. the good thing is that this product washes out easily with any shampoo ",positive
" this stuff is great. i used to buy new gels pommades pastes etc. every month because i could never find one that worked exactly how i wanted it to. but i first tried this a year ago and it's all i've used since. and it lasts a long time so don't be afraid of the price. one container lasts me about 6 months so you only have to buy it twice a year. i'll be ordering my third order of it soon ",positive
" i just had my fine processed hair cut into a short layered wedge. it was shoulder length before and i used a revlon thermal-air styler to make it acceptable. after using dirt i no longer have to spend any time styling it!! i just blow dry scrunching my hair with my fingers and when almost dry i turn my head upside-down and apply about a dime size amount of dirt into the roots. flip up and i'm ready to go all in less than 3 minutes. i find it important to rub dirt between my palms to warm it up before applying. use a little first...you can always add more. it gave my hair great body and control. hope this product works for you too ",positive
" this works great on short and long hair and you can use wet or dry. i have long hair and i love using this product. it works great for those evenings after a long day and you want to give your hair new life. fantastic ",positive
" i have long thick wavy hair that loves to frizz up. i have tried every anti-frizz hairstyling product out there and they either didn't work or weighed my hair down. i didn't want to like this hair dryer and was hoping it wouldn't live up to the hype... but it's excellent on my hair. after using the dryer (with no styling product) my hair was straight shiny and felt great. for me it didn't change the amount of time i dried my hair so if your considering buying it for speed don't unless you have thin or short hair. is it worth the $200.00 price tag? depends on you personally but i recommend you shop around because there are better deals out there ",positive
" i have been reading about this miracle hair dryer for months in the beauty magazines i read so i will admit i was very excited to pruchase it. the results however will amaze even the most cynical consumer. my hair has never looked so good when styled at home. true it looks about the same as what my hairstylist does but to me that is well worth the moderately high price tag. it was a good buy for me because i spend a lot of money buying a variety of cremes and glosses to make my hair pretty and now i know it wasn't the products i put in that made my hair look bad it was the dryer.i was so surprised to notice that even the ends of my hair were shiny and my ends are sooo fried. the difference is astounding. i bought this dryer in a package with the babyliss straightener and i would definately recommend that to anyone wanting to buy this dryer. for the same price you can get a free straightener. (a very good one!) ",positive
" i had stopped using a regular hair dryer a few of months ago as i felt that my hair was becoming brittle and looking damaged. however air drying my hair seemed to take forever. it was then that i heard about the t3 tourmaline professional ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser. initially the $200 price tag did put me off and i pushed the idea aside. but somehow it remained somewhere in the corner of my mind and one fine day after getting late for a meeting yet again i decided to bite the bullet and buy the hairdryer. and i tell you i have never been happier using a hair dryer. my hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself. it has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow. though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model the after effect is worth the price paid. the product does come with a 4-year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price. though the sales brochures uses a lot of scientific terms like ionic mineral and blah... blah... i am not going to bother about it much as far as my hair appears healthy and saves me time so that i don't have to deal with being late for meetings. i recommend this product to all who would love to have a mane to be proud of ",positive
" this is a great idea for a product! for those of you who don't wash your hair every day this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you don't wash it. i used this after 5 days without washing and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful! well done ",positive
" i bought the shampoo theory and condition theory and this redo freshen-up mist. i have normal-type hair that needs to be washed every other day -- and if i use a lot of product it needs to be washed every day. i have very sensitive skin too. this mist worked very well on my hair definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry. and it feels awesome on my skin. well done jonathan ",positive

" i got a sample of this conditioner when i bought a similar product by another company. i didn't care for the one i purchased but the sample was awesome and i am going to buy the jonathan conditioner. i have always had fine limp hair and tried lots of volume products. i used this for a week and this is the only thing i have ever seen any kind of difference with. i love it! ",positive
" its effect very much depends on the climate you live in. if you live in a colder and dry climate especially during winter it does exactly as it promises - great moisturizer lines are diminished as is puffiness. i really love using it - i am 35 and currently living in a cold and dry climate. but in hot and sometims humid climates or during summer it just doesn't work as well - i don't know why. i like it a lot and this is my 3rd bottle although i am using it as a seasonal eye care ",positive
" i couldn't say if this diminished wrinkles or puffyness but it's fab for great feeling eyes the whole area is velvety smooth and skin feels as soft as silk ",positive
" i never wanted to waste my money on a manicure because my polish would be chipping/peeling by the next day. my pedicurist bet me that she could keep the polish on my manicure by using this stuff and low and behold...it worked! it kept the polish on for a week even through housecleaning and a trip to vegas ",positive

" cold weather will be with us for a while and nothing makes one feel warmer than being wrapped in a delicious flowery fragrance - that certainly is chanel no. 22. it's a blend of white flowers that has resulted in a scent which is both sweetly innocent and sensuous. continuing in their use of symbolism and numbers after the overwhelming success of chanel no. 5 coco chanel and ernest beaux developed yet another fragrance naming it no. 22 for the year it was presented. it may have been created in 1922 but it's as up to the minute as tomorrow especially in the new spray. ",positive
" the still life bath bomb contains pretty sunflower petals that make this a summery bath experience. to be truthful after putting this in the bath i walked away and came back into the room wondering who was eating fruit loops! that is the scent of this fun to take a bath before breakfast experience. the fresh scent of lemon and sweet wild orange mingles with bergamot and gardenia extract. the result of this bath is a refreshing - i can face the day feeling. if you want to enhance the experience try the happy hippy shower gel with grapefruit. the i love juicy shampoo and veganese conditioner also complete the citrus experience. if you think the petals in this bath bombs are fun (the ones in my bath slipped right down the drain) wait until you try the big blue experience with seaweed. it does take an adventurous spirit to try some of these items but as an official lush addict i tend to dive into the experiences with abandon. you may also love golden slumbers (lavender and neroli) sex bomb (jasmine ylang ylang clary sage) romance in a stone (wild orange mandarin & tangarine). onward to try tisty toasty which i hear is a bit of a love spell style bath with rose petals. ~the rebecca review ",positive

" i've been wearing makeup to some degree or another for over 30 years and i've never ever found foundation as good pure non-irritating glow-y or simply as perfect as bare minerals. i truly believe it cleared up my adult acne within a month that i started using it. i just ordered this kit and i'm confident it will perform as well as the other products i have by this company. don't waste your $$ on the imitators- everyone's jumped on the mineral makeup bandwagon now but this original line is hands-down the best ",positive
" love the bare escentuals line of products. not one for makeups to begin with this allows me to even out my skin tonegive vibrance and is good for the skin. have never had any skin problems with this line and believe me my skin is sensitive ",positive
" i've been using strivectin-sd for almost two years. there isn't a day that goes by that i don't get a complement on my skin. i don't wear any make up aside from lipstick. my skin alway glows and the fine lines are hardly visible. i'm in the beauty business and i recommend this product to my customers. i am not a spokesperson for the company only a happy and satisfied customer ",positive
" i've gotten a few compliments on it...by my advice to the ladies who want to buy perfume via online...buy the smaller bottles first to see if you really like the scent...moreso than the big bottles. i bought the $50 one and i do like it but i think it's gonna take me awhile to finish it...so from now on i'll buy the 1.7 oz. first and then buy the bigger bottles if i like the scent. but overall very fresh and sweet smelling.. ",positive
" obviously some people don't care about reviewing an item just about bashing a pop artist that doesn't deserve it. anyway i think it smells great. obviously it does or it wouldn't be the bestselling perfume right now. but don't take my word for it go to your nearest store and give it a sniff. also be sure to check out fantasy i think it smells even better ",positive
" i have to agree with the previous reviewer when i say that possibly this is one for the ladies. but only in a good way! i first encountered this scent walking past the fragrance counter at the mall many years ago. at the time it seemed that all the fragrances for men were heavy musks orientals spices etc. this was...er...fruity. (i see you cringing!) it's lemony. like a puff of lemon cake. a breeze over a lemon field in tuscany. (are there fields of lemons in tuscany? i don't know but it's a mental pic go with it!) a spritz of cologne following a bit of aftershave balm is a sure recipe to get yourself sniffed and cuddled. it doesn't bash you over the head with macho tones- it lures with tingling tartness. i have yet to meet a woman who dislikes the scent. and yes i do steal it from my husband sometimes! on him (a light eyed blond) it stays true to the bottle scent but on me (brunette with oily skin) it morphs to something with vanilla notes in the lemon. i think it's a great safe gift for people who aren't sure what cologne to buy for a new male friend. i gave it four stars because the cologne does need to be reapplied frequently to maintain a viable scent. the fragrance lasts for approximately four hours. but if you can't get noticed for your lemony deliciousness in four hours you have more problems than a cologne will fix. (brush your teeth!) laugh!! : ",positive
" i've tried all types of eyeliner and they all end up smudging or flaking off very messy by the end of a long day (or night). i bought this one to wear at my wedding (in the fantastic chocolate shade) and it was absolutely perfect! well worth the price. great wear easy to apply (with a very skinny-tipped brush i ended up using a tiny paintbrush)and stays exactly where you put it ",positive
" this scent is so clean and not over-powering! i love this product! it lasts too! there's really no need to reapply ",positive
" i was very pleased with this purchase. the perfume arrived packaged nicely and was actually bigger than i expected 1 oz. to be. i love the scent and will definately buy more when this one is gone! great experience with amazon ",positive
" i have always loved happy but i love my happy heart! i wear it 99% of the time. my guy loves the smell too...and i often get comments that it smells wonderful. not too strong just enough. :) i'd recommend this perfume to everyone young and old. ",positive
" i may be the only woman alive who doesn't like happy but i love heart! it's a perfect fragrance not too strong but not too light. it's very feminine ",positive
" this is probably one to keep away from the kids. it smells good enough to eat and its frothy whipped consistency makes it even more tempting! it's a bit pricey but it lathers up really well. i found that about a teaspoon full on my loofah was more than enough for my shower. and it just smells amazing! very refreshing and a definite mood-lifter. now i want to try the whipped body delight in this scent ",positive
" the flavor and scent are great! i continue to smell the sugar scent for a while after applying and it lasts on my lips for a long time. it's a nice shiny look but doesn't go overboard ",positive
" this lip gloss smells good goes on slick and stays on a long time. great value for the price. i love philosophy products. they're all great ",positive
" i love the idea that this is an all natural mascara + has organic ingredients but nothing artifical or chemicals!! this is the tipe of mascara which lengthens the lashes not volumises it (i think dr. hauschka doesn't make that kind). when it's time to wash it off it comes off very easy (spares your lashes). unfortunately i couldn't change my 4 star recommendation to 2...and this is a follow up on my previous review. when i'd been using this mascara for about 2 weeks i noticed that it started to flake except for some reason the flakes ended up in my eyes not on my cheek or under my eyes. first i didn't know it was the mascara..i thought something went into my eyes but every single time i applied it happened. not straight away..but in about 2-3 hours later..this was very frustrating...i tried to put less of this product on my lashes but then i looked like i had nothing on. at this point i still had some flaking not as bad as before but it was still enough to hurt my eyes..so i just stopped using this product all together. the only reason why i'd give 2 stars for this product instead of 1 because it's natural and organic...and i appriciate that fact. but that's about it. i really wanted to like this product so i am very disappointed it wasn't cheap either. dr. hauschka need to improve the quality of this product ",positive
" i read many positive (and very few negative) reviews before i ordered my first tube. i am 65 living in florida and have been using it once daily on face and back of hands for about 4 months. the cream goes on smoothly and i have had no negative reaction. friends tell me that my face is noticeably younger looking with less wrinkles. in fact two friends based on my favorable experience are also planning to purchase kinerase ",positive
" foams nicely in the tub rinses away cleanly. skin isn't left with any film. instead your skin is left very soft and with a good scent. falling in love smells sweet and relaxing and makes me think of cotton candy. the large bottle lasts quite a while as a bath gel but goes considerably quicker if you choose to use it as a shower gel. recommend you use it with a loofah in the shower ",positive
" i must say that i have been really impressed with this product. i tend to have skin that is combo/oily which results in occasional pimples here and there. not really acne but annoying blackheads and bumps. i had been using something else similar to this with ok results. however within just 2 days of beginning this i noticed immediate results. my breakouts have been a non-event and even if i get a pimple here or there it's gone in a day. i've even noticed a drastic improvement in those hard-to-eliminate blackheads. my skin feels much smoother and my pores look better. i don't see how i could ever be without this ",positive
" this is the only blemish treatment that i have ever tried that will get rid of anything. ive been using it for 8 years and it has never let me down. you can use it as a spot treatment or if you have an area of clogged pores on your nose you can put a little on every night to help clear those up. it isnt meant to go on the places of your face where you have no acne or blemishes though. it is strong and can cause a little peeling if you put it on your entire face. it's a little pricey but the size of this container will probably last you close to a year ",positive
" this powder is great. it has great coverage without looking cakey. i also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be touched-up a little more often than other powders i've tried but it's worth it ",positive
" i like clinique a lot i needed powder so i got it in beige..i also like the double pressed powder for even more coverage..fast shippin ",positive
" this being my first badger brush i don't know how competent a reviewer i can be but i am really happy with it. it is large enough to hold a lot of foam (sometimes i fell like it actually holds too much). it is fairly heavy and robust which i also like. i've been using it for about 6 months now and have a feeling that it is going to last for years. make sure to hang it to dry and wash it thoroughly after each use. for anybody who is new to the wonderful world of shaving with a brush i highly recommend this page as a intro: [...] ",positive
" i have been using strivectin sd eye cream for one month. i am 30 and have no wrinkles but some uneven skin tone so i cannot comment on wrinkle restoration - my goal is prevention. however i have a small unsightly broken blood vessel underneath one eye that i have had for 10 years. applying strivectin 2x per day has diminished the appearance significantly in just 4 weeks. i am of course hopeful that it will disappear completely with continued use. i never expected that the broken blood vessel could be treated topically and i was thinking of having a laser treatment (a bit scary though near the eye!). i am thrilled with the cream and will stick with it.

" laura mercier cosmetics are a bit like bon-bons - you can't have just one. she makes it easy for us with her eye color duos - 2 compatible eye shadow colors in one mirrored compact. while there are five appealing color combinations all fresh and sheer my current favorites are moss and azure. with two colors one light and one dark i have a veritable palette of possibilities. each can be used alone or together with one shading under the brow and the other on the lid. or the colors can be mixed for a completely different effect. colors are intensified by a second or third application. (a sponge tipped swab is very effective for this.) merci mercier! ",positive

" i can't even begin to explain how much i love this product. although teen age acne is long gone for me like most women at that certain time of the month i get a little flair up here and there. this product is great. totally takes the red out and i say speeds the healing process as well. i found it it made them disappear over night if i dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when i saw the begingings of one. ones i caught early on never really turned into full blown acne. yes it's pricey but i think it's worth every penny.

" if you are like me and get the occasional zit when you least expect it then this works out well. it will not remove the zit but it will cover the nasty monster pretty well!! i put it under my lancome powder and it really made a difference. because it is clear it will blend in with whatever foundation or powder you use. oh yes and it covers all the redness that comes with those nasty zits. a girls new best friend : ",positive
" if you're like me you get the occasional zit at the most inopportune time. benefit's boo boo zap! is a bit spendy for such a small amount (about the size of a small tube of lipstick) but it does help. while it won't erase the zit overnight it will get the red out. you can dab some on under or over makeup too because it goes on clear not tinted. definitely worth a try ",positive
" i used this product in the evening and noticed immediate plumping. i also use lipfusion xl (50.00)- but sometimes the results are not long-lasting. when i used the too-faced lip injection mask- the results were immediate and seemed to continue for hours. when i woke in the morning- my lips were very plumped- much more so than with lip fusion alone. i will use these products together- the lip injection mask from too-faced is amazing! used first then with lip fusion xl layered on top after rinsing off the mask- it seriously looked like i had undergone medical-procedure lip-plumping! i highly reccommend this lip injection mask.

" this product will not work for everyone. it's not really for people with straight fine hair. it's formulated to target mostly women of color who have tightly curled thick natural hair. i apply about a nickle-size of this stuff to the ends of my hair before i style it. it leaves my hair soft manageable and conditioned - eliminating breakage so that it can grow long and healthy. the aroma is a little too earthy for my personal taste but i can handle that as long as the natural ingredients work. i give it 5 stars ",positive
" i love this product. it has healed my brittle hair after being bleached one too many times. i use it every day and it not only heals and conditions my hair but it holds my style in place. as some people mentioned it can make your hair greasy. you have to make sure to massage it into your hair and only use a little. ",positive
" i liked this product so much-i'm buying some for my family members who live out of town! only a small amount leaves my hair feeling soft shiny and moisturized. and it's great on my ends-especially with roller sets! plus my darling hubby loves the scent. i use it along with the khoret amen hair oil ",positive
" this product is fantastic! i use it for my daughter who has very thick beautiful and coarse hair! it tames her enough so it is not unmanageable and leaves it shiny and soft - this works well with the hair balm!! ",positive
" i have tried many face cleaners murad acne clarifying cleanser and it is great. murad acne clarifying cleanser has a nice scent and leaves my face feeling tingly clean without dry it out. murad acne clarifying cleanser helps control my acne and i would recommend murad to anyone who needs help with acne. ",positive
" i know it sounds cliche but i have literally tried every acne product both over the counter and prescription. such products include (but are not limited to) proactiv exposed skin care differin accutane neutrogena products clean and clear etc. i have never had results like this. i previously tried the murad acne complex and found it to be a little too harsh for my red irritated sensitive skin. i currently switched to the sensitive line for the murad acne complex which consists of this cleanser moisturizing acne treatment gel and the cellular replenishing serum. i have found that my cistic acne is gone the blotchiness is reduced and the number of whiteheads has drastically reduced. my skin has never looked so smooth in all my pre-teen and young adult life and i have only been using this particular line for 4 days! in addition to the sensitive acne complex i would also recommend getting the clarifying toner. and remember a little goes a long way with these products!

" i recently became a fan of body shop products and am only sorry that i didn't try them sooner. their products are all without fail of superior quality. the satsuma line especially is wonderful and is my favorite scent from the body shop. it is the juicy fresh smell of tangerines/oranges. i have read some reviews that it reminds people of a creamsicle type scent but i completely disagree with that. i have never liked creamsicle scents and i love satsuma. it is not cloying or too sweet. it is a very pure scent and i always feel clean and beautiful while wearing it. one other thing to note about this product... i do not always like perfume oils because the scent is not always accurate when compared to other products in the same line. i am not sure if this is because sometimes the oils are so concentrated that they smell like too much. the satsuma oil is not like that at all - it smells true to the rest of the line. the scent also lasts for a long time after being applied due to the fact that it is a perfume oil. a little goes a long way - i would not be surprised if the bottle lasted for over a year. i love this product and give it my highest recommendation. ",positive
" this is currently my absolute favorite scent. i get so discouraged when smell somthing in a store love it buy it take it home and put it on and smells completely different on me. i have never had that problem with this scent. it's smells delicious in the bottle and on the skin that is if you like citrus. it smells like a fresh ripe orange with the slightest hint of spice. the man in my life finds it quite cuddle worthy. if you are not familiar with perfume oils just somthing to note. they are highly concentrated a little goes a long way. it also phases nicely from intense to pleasently subtle and is long lasting. another bonus is that there are only few ingredients so it's less likely to irritate sensitive skin. one bottle will last and last there is a flexable applicator wand inside the lid. i really can't say enough about this wonderful fragrance ",positive
" this oil smells so good i just love it. all of my friends say i smell so good ",positive
" i have very thick hair. i stopped relaxing it one year ago and felt it was not very easy to manage. i found the kerastase shampoo and combined it with the smoothing mask and my hair became much more easy to manage! now i can comb through it as soon as the conditioner is rinsed ",positive
" my significate other bought the shampoo for me i use the hair butter and various other products from carol's daughter. i was very fortune to actually make it to the store in new york. i have very short barber-style hair and the scent drives people wild. i will continue to buy these products; if you like the fruity-tuttie smells and your hair grease non petroleum based carol's daughter is for you ",positive
" this is a wonderfully light sunscreen that makes my face feels very smooth. definitely worth the money! if you do buy this product make sure you apply it over your moisturizer otherwise it will flake when it dries. ",positive
" this is an excellent product but i have a problem disguising the white look it leaves on my face. at first i thought it was because i used too much but even when i use only a tiny amount it is still white. it will certainly suit persons with pale complexions. wish there was a tint to it ",positive
" if you want an spf that is strong light non-greasy and doesn't smell this is definitely it. i am addicted and will never use anything else : ",positive
" this stuff is wonderful! i still use a moisturizer w/ spf 15 but why settle for spf 15 when you can get spf 40? this is not a creamy sunscreen that makes your skin feel all oily and like it can't breathe instead it's more on the liquid side and you just quickly rub it in then you can go ahead and put your regular moisturizer and makeup over it. it's lovely and light and you can wear it every day. it's the only sunscreen i have found that has enough spf coverage for my sensitive pale skin but isn't thick enough to clog up my pores and cause breakouts. it may seem expensive but not only is the quality of the product worth it but you only need a small amount. i wear it during the spring and the summer and after a year i'm still working on the same bottle. i wasn't sure if it was going to be effective (not being from a brand that you usually associate with rugged outdoor activity) but after a week by the beach i was the only one who's face wasn't burned all red even though everyone else had been wearing coppertone and bullfrog facial sunscreen ",positive
" i absolutely love this scent. i originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much i bought the lotion. the scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell. i have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells. if you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you'll love this ",positive
" i've been using city lips for the past 6 months and i absolutely love it! i especially love the moisturizing effect; i used to have to use chapstick constantly but now i never use it. my lips now are always soft and moisturized and fuller! ",positive
" citylips has made my lips larger! i love the clear i use it all day long. i will buy this product again ",positive
" when i first tried this perfume it reminded very much of victoria's secret pink--it had that same distinctly sweet strongly scented unique floral note yet here the bouquet was significantly softer sweeter. it would work well for someone who likes a sweet girly scent that is light yet still pronounced. the one drawback is that the staying power is poor: i couldn't detect any trait of this just a few hours later. this is a bit disappointing give the high price yet this still might be a good choice for someone who is looking for an everyday fragrance and doesn't mind having to reapply ",positive
" i absolutely fell in love with this fragrance. it smells like a day at the county fair absolutely lovely. you have to layer it though to make it last.. wash with the shower gel put on the body lotion first thing when you get out of the shower or bath (perfumes stick better that way while you're moist) and then spray. if you wash your hair spray while your blow-drying it out. carry the spray in your purse you will need to touch up during the day ",positive
" i was afraid of this fragrance in the bottle since it smelled like carmelized sugar to me. i tried the shower gel first loved it had to try the perfume. everyone loves it! my friend even asked if she could copy me and wear it too! of course i said yes everyone needs a little love! we both agree to spritz a little extra on if you want others to smell it it goes on very light. an extra spritz is not obnoxious with this scent ",positive
" this scent is truly intoxicating. i have tried various perfumes like arpege evelyn rose and j'adore but there was always something missing. flower by kenzo is by far the most satisfying fragrance. it has the elegance of arpege sensuality of evelyn rose and classiness of j'adore. this product-line also have matching deoderant so not to clash with the perfume. how nice is that! it is not too strong either but lasts for a long time. i have at last found my favorite scent that makes me feel really good ",positive
" i have to admit i'm a very picky perfume shopper...but flower by kenzo is amazing. is light flowery elegant & casual...truly wonderful ",positive
" this is my favorite perfume i have ever had before! my mom wants this for christmas and shes been using my whole bottle! you may think that im a kid and i will say that but i am a huge kenzo fan! i love her dearly and i say that this is the best perfume she ever made before. u gotta give the girl credit! i love this perfume. this is not a waste of money and the reviews are right they don't stay that long but i dont care because u may not smell it strong but that is because this fragrance is eligant and beautiful! i love it. i bet you would to! it is sooooooooo not a waste of money!

" i have only used clinique eye shadows and have been so happy with them. i've tried different brands and always come back to this one. they have great colors and it lasts all day without creasing or looking too powdery. ",positive
" this product really does feel like silk....out of all the eye products i really like this one. i would recommend it! ",positive
" love this scent. definately not too strong and it seems to last quite a while. perfect for everyday wear. it has a strong undertone of vanilla so if that's not your bag i wouldn't recommend it ",positive
" im really sorry about my review below. my friend did it without me knowing off my accout. im really sorry ",positive
" i wish it smelled more of cinnamon and less of clove. but that's just me. i'm not a huge clove fan. but it worked great made my hair & scalp feel awesome. will definitely buy this again. and i can't wait to try other lush products ",positive
" my hair tends to fall out due to me not eating enough protein so new! (hair) is a lifesaver. as others have said it lathers like you wouldn't believe -- you really only need to roll it in your hands two or three times to get enough for a thick lather -- and it has an amazing scent. (sniffing the bar can actually be a bit addictive...you can smell it really strongly even before you open the box!) i've found that keeping it in a small lightly covered dish in my bedroom away from the moisture of the bathroom is the best way to preserve it for a while. (also it works as an accidental room freshener -- seriously the smell is incredible!) my only wish is that the scent would last a little longer in my hair since it doesn't really stick even right after showering unless i use a lot of lather and that ends up being expensive since then the bar doesn't last as long. most of the time there isn't even much of a hint whereas other lush shampoos can make your hair smell wonderful even a bit overpowering for days. also unlike some of the other lush products it leaves my hair fairly flat. it's true that it helps with making hair really soft and shiny but it seems to have the opposite effect when it comes to volume and that's not so good when you're already having some hair loss. using a mostly scent-free conditioner after is almsot necessary at least in my experience. i think new! (hair) is a terrific shampoo for its hair-restoring qualities and general sniffability but at the same time it could be a little better with its more cosmetic qualities. buy it more for the former than the latter if you want the most enjoyment and value out of it. and if you do have hair loss trust me -- the price is worth it ",positive
" i love this shampoo. it make my hair so soft and shiny. i cut the shampoo in four and use it every other day. then i keep it at dry place. this shampoo last long too. the smell is great too. love it! i'm going to buy it for my mom ",positive
" i just bought this the other day having owned the regular sized kabuki brush. i find i like the baby buki better it still gives great coverage just in a more compact size which i love ",positive
" my title says it all. this smells so amazing and is such a lush and fabulous lather that i will never wash with any other soap again. i even bought the perfume because i found myself sniffing my arms all day long after a shower. it's fantastic it's totally worth the money and it lasts a long time. one bottle lasts me 2-3 months bathing every day. i've even used this in my hair before... but it tends to dry out my hair a lot and i need a lot of moisture because i have blonded curly hair. ",positive
" the kerastase line is hard to find (used to be only sold in kerastase salons i believe.) the shampoos do exactly what they say. in this case this is a moisturizing shampoo for dried hair that may be overly chemically treated. i only wish they came in larger bottles ",positive
" since i was in high school so many women have praised the wonders of almost lipstick in black honey. i finally self-gifted and purchased for myself and all of my expectations have been met. the color is initially scary in the tube but at the very least swipe it on your hand - you'll see that it is actually a very wearable sheer brownish raspberry color. you can layer it for a stronger color or swipe it over lip balm to make it even more sheer. the resulting effect is your lips but better. the color of your lips is improved and they are moist and shiny looking. if you layer repeatedly over dry lips it is a very shiny deep red brown color. i've seen black honey worn by fair/medium asian and white women and has looked flattering on every one of them. lastly the product does not smell. it has no perfumes that become disgusting as the day wears on nor does it have that cheap waxy smell/taste. a fabulous product ",positive
" i have: long thick fine hair that is naturally wavy. i don't color my hair but i do get frizzies and split ends and some dryness. i tried this product out after receiving a small sample with a [...] order and fell in love with it. i -love- the smell and was surprised that other people didn't seem to. i vastly prefer it to some of the faker more chemical smells that a lot of shampoos seem to use. i didn't use it as a leave in but did the deep conditioning treatment and afterwards i kept flipping my hair forward over my shoulder both to smell it and to just feel how amazingly soft it was. this product left my hair looking healthy shiny and gorgeous for days. i get a fair number of compliments on my hair in general but after i used this stuff i was getting stopped on the street. everyone from the lady at starbucks to my professor mentioned how beautiful my hair looked. i highly recommend it. i have tried a lot of hair products including some (like fekkai's glossing cream) made with olive oil and had better results with ojon (though i do like a lot of fekkai products). other products i recommend are: healthy sexy hair shampoo conditioner and leave-in conditioner jonathan product anti-frizz serum origins happy ending conditioner and fekkai products for curly and straight hair depending on your mood :) products i don't recommend include suave and fekkai's glossing shampoo (left my hair shiny all right but frizzy.) i would suggest ordering it from sephora as they carry several sizes give samples with all online orders and are very very good at taking returns even if you've tried the product out and just don't like it ",positive
" i have straight hair and this products makes my hair insanely smooth and beautiful...the smell is strong but i like it though everyone won't. use very little of the restorative treatment or your hair will be very oily ",positive
" i use renergie microlift active redefining treatment as a preconditioner prior to the placement of foundation on my face. i cannot imagine using anything else. i find it challenging to find a product that allows my foundation to go on silky smooth yet without feeling greasy or causing blemishes. i am in my fourties and this is the best product i have found ",positive
" great salt scrub and it really does get warm on contact and leaves skin baby sooofft ",positive
" i have extremely dry skin that builds up and needs exfoliation frequently and i've tried every body wash gritty scrub brush and soap known from clarins down to caress and this bar works like magic for me! i didn't notice fantastic decrease in cellulite and the little bumps do wear off. but using the soap practically molts me leaving dead skin behind in the bathtub (yikes!) and i'm ready for application of other products right into my new skin (fat girl slim...clarins total body firming cream...i prefer dior plasticity). and goodbye ingrown hairs- the stuff is great for prevention. did i metion a great exfoliator prior to self-tanning? this stuff is a great buy! the long-lasting soapy smell that interferes with my perfume is the only reason i gave it 4 stars ",positive
" everything was great about this from the product to the promptness which it was received. ",positive
" this product is the best of this type i've ever used. i would recommend it ",positive
" tweezerman browmousse is a clear gel that you brush onto your eyebrows to hold them in place. i had tried other brands of styling gels for brows and was left very disappointed - they flaked and looked all stiff and gross. since i am such a huge fan of the tweezerman tweezers i figured i would give their browmousse a try and boy was i ever satisfied! this gel held my brows in place all day without a single stray. no flaking! no stiff brows! and it is so easy to apply. it comes with a mascara style brush that you simply whisk over your brows to style and keep them where you want them. it stays all day and comes off easily with make up remover. browmousse is a definite step up from all other brands i've tried. i will recommend this product to all my friends. ",positive
" this is the best concealer i have ever worn. it covers well without making me look fake or cakey around the eyes. not greasy either. the powder that comes with this is a nice touch for traveling. however i gave this a four star because it is pricey. amazon should try and give customers discounts. ",positive
" this stuff goes on easy stays well (but will rub off with water won't withstand a good cry). nice. not quite as nice as the victoria's secret liner (i swear by that stuff discontinued 3-4 years ago) but way better than anything cheaper. i have tried other things. plus won't irritate my very sensitive eyes ",positive
" this eyeliner really matches the description it goes on super smooth and doesn't tug or drag. i was told at the counter that it was water resistant but it's really not. i used to wear it under my lower eyelashes but by the end of the day it would be totally smudged and gross. i would even try to put powder over it but to no avail. however in defense of laura i am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes aren't friendly to many pencil eye liners. i was just hoping against hope that laura's would be different! so now i only use it over the upper lid ",positive

" i have used many many products from the cheapest drugstore ones to the high end department store stuff and kinerase cream is truly one of the best for overall skin improvement. i am a big fan of minimal redness and irritation and this cream delivers in spades. leaves my skin beautifully soft super smooth and all without added perfume (who's going to smell your face?) and additives. i have also used the lotion version which contains retinyl palmitate but i much prefer this cream which adds more moisture and doesn't contain any retinoids which can cause irritation. isn't that the whole premise and purpose of kinerase anyway? great stuff ",positive
" i have tried so many products b/c i have tiny laugh lines and i am so not ready for them yet. this product has helped beyond belief! i love it!!! i wanted to write a review because beauty products are very expensive and i wanted to say save your money and don't buy anything but kinerase if you want results! it is awesome!!

" i'm very particular about the stuff i put on my face. i've used nivea aloe jack black kiehls & baxter among others. i decided to give it a shot and all i can say is wow. it says it's fragrance free but it's got a small (very very very small) hint of lemon perhaps? you only need a liberal amount and you're good to go. moisture is retained with glycerin and it soothes with aloe and chamomile (mmmm). if you're looking for subtle yet tasteful facial lotion that's made for men you've gota try this. it's even allergy tested. not to mention part of the proceeds are donated to prostate cancer research.

" if you have dry skin on your hands these gloves are very nice. i place mine in the microwave for 15 seconds while i apply moisturizer to my hands. slide the gloves onto your hands as soon as the microwave is finished. in 15 minutes you have a quick but effective moisturizing treatment. if your hands are really dry you could do the same thing but leave them on overnight. i found the overnight option to be a little warm on my hands. but it might work fine for you. these socks are 94% cotton and 6% spandex. they can be machine washed and tumbled dried. i have not found it necessary launder them each time i use them. i use a light moisturizer (cetaphil) so you might have a different experience if you use a heavier product to moisturize. i would highly recommend this product. ",positive
" this is the best long-wearing lipstick i have ever bought. it lasts on me for about 6-7 hours...through meals drinks etc. the best part is that it isn't flakey. it also has little hints of glitter in it that really make your lips shine. the icing on the cake is that it has a subtle watermelon smell. ",positive
" this is hands down the best all day lipwear i have ever owned. i own alot!!! not only does it stay on all day beautifully but it does not dry your lips out. with other extended wearlipsticks you are given a seperate hydrating gloss. sephora maniac long wearing lipstick does not need it. my lips never dried out and looked moist and smooth all day not cakey and cracked as others tend to do. purchase this lipstick with cofidence and without hesitation. you will not be disappointed ",positive
" for a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is mac. lipglass feels good on your lips as if it contained some emollients. and (this is a big and) it's not tacky or sticky. the colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood occasion and skin tone. they range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. another plus (and this is a big plus following the big and) mac lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. try adding a lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. enjoy! gail cook ",positive
" i changed this review from when i first wrote it a couple of weeks ago. when i first wrote it the title was i like it. now i've changed it to i love it!!! because the more i use it the more sure i am that i will not ever buy regular mascara again. this mascara will not smudge! it will not leave racoon eyes under your lash line. it goes on where you put it and stays there until you take it off. it also does not irritate my eyes. i never thought i would find a mascara that didn't make me want to rub and rub my eyes. i hate rubbing my eyes because i know it makes them baggy and makes wrinkles. i have been seeing mascara which forms a tube around the lash advertised in high-end catalogs lately and have been intrigued. when i found out philosophy a brand i really respect had this type of mascara available i had to order it right away. as soon as the ups man brought it i applied it. it makes your lashes look really long! they have a lot of individual definition and show up as very distinct. this mascara doesn't fatten the lashes but it lengthens them so much and it is a much cleaner look than the lash thickening mascara i have been using. i really like the look and the mascara does not smudge or rinse off easily in water. it seems to stay on really well without the clumpy greasy feeling i get from waterproof mascara. it comes off neatly in little chunks when you rub a little purity made simple cleanser on it. i really like this mascara and i will buy it again. actually i am going to throw out all my other kinds of mascara and only get this kind ",positive
" i bought the lotion #2 and the moisurizing gel about 3 weeks ago [which is wonderful] but passed on the soap. i'm a teenager who has a slight problem with acne so that's why i bought the neutrogena acne wash instead which has salicylic acid that will help for acne. by itself the acne wash does not work but so far with the clinique i have not broken out at all! not a single pimple. everything is smooth and toned. i love my skin and it glows. i recommend getting the milder lotion for people with fairer and more sensitive skin as this is known to peel and cause redness to some. the salicylic acid is necessary for me and my light breaks-out-during-that-time-of-month skin. so if you do not have an acne problem i think any soap is alright. to anyone who is worried about spending too much money: if it does not work for you there is a guarantee that lets ou get all your money back. it's great ",positive
" i like this scent. my first thought was pears before reading what the notes were yes apples. this is not a hardcore apple scent but enough so. very fresh and sweet but not too sweet. crisp and spring-like. a hint a tiny hint of dandelions and a tiny bit of rose just a tiny bit. my husband likes this scent on me as well which is saying a lot. he hates roses and foody scents but still likes this.

" this product is just another example of why i am an anthony's customer for life. i could spend all day extolling the virtues of the entire anthony product line... meanwhile this alcohol free toner is just fantastic. if you have super-duper sensitive skin as i you will love this product.. i guarantee it. the toner does not burn irrate cause peeling or rashes to develop nor does it dry your skin out. it leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed with a very mild lite scent that dissipates in seconds. when using this product only a few drops is needed per application onto a cotton ball. to get the full benefits of this toner the only requirements are just a few light and gentle sweeping outward motions away from the face. before you know it.. voila! the daily grime and pollutants no longer reside on your face ",positive

" i have a persistent patch of eczema on my neck that dream cream cleared up in just a couple of weeks. i've also been using it daily as a hand lotion and just after i get out of the shower on my legs. it has completely gotten rid of the red bumpy and scaly patches that have plagued my legs in the winter. i've tried dozens of body lotions/creams and this is my absolute favorite ",positive
" i absolutely love lush products and this is my favorite of them all. it smells great (kind of herbal) absorbs quickly and is very soothing ",positive
" what i really like about this product is that little goes a long long way. i used to use various body butters on my driest skin and this product is like those in that you don't need to use much of it. just a bit is enough even for really dry areas like elbows knees and feet. i find one fingertipful is enough for both knees and elbows or for both feet; two fingertipfuls are enough for my legs post-shaving. i like it better than body butters because it is light and not greasy (unless you use too much) and you can use it on your whole body not just the drier spots. another big plus is the scent: it's a fresh clean herbal scent that doesn't linger over-long so you can enjoy it while you're putting it on and not have to smell it all day long ",positive

" i always buy this soap when i travel in france. when i found it on amazon i was elated! it is so moisturizing that i never need to use any body creams or lotions. with its simple and pure properties of olive oil vegetable oil and mediterranean sea salted water; savon de marseille is the ultimate soap to use for dry skin. the large 1000gm. blocks are a great value and they can be cut easily into four individual 250gm. bars. great for ones' own personal use. for gift giving the 300gm. bars are perfect! if you want to walk out of the shower and not immediately feel compelled to put on hand cream or body cream use this masterpiece soap ",positive
" this soap works well for sensitive skin. smells like olive oil but hey that's why they named it olive oil soap. ",positive
" this is a great lipstick and a wonderful idea from cargo. i would very much recommend it. the lindsay color is great and the formula is very smooth and sheer enough so that it goes well with your skin. the four stars are because i love smelly things... and this one just smells like lipstick. it could smell yummier i suppose. but so far i love it ",positive
" clinique's bare brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever! it has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it. i have berrylicious(sheer grape) and cherry quartz(sheer true red--doesn't look like it does on the color swatch) and neither overwhelms my pale skin. i wouldn't be caught dead without a bare brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse!

" after looking and looking for the perfect brown lipstick that wasn't red or too dark i tried this and bought it on the spot. this is the best color if you're looking for a shimmer and just enough color. this lipstick isn't sticky dry or cakey ",positive
" i've used a nylon scrubbie for years. the salux bath towel is much better! i received it as a gift from someone who had one and knew how wonderful it was. it has a fairly rough texture which is a fantastic exfoliator. i use it with a bath gel (never soap it's too drying) and my skin has never been softer. it's extra long length makes it perfect for getting your entire back. it drys very quickly - can't live without it ",positive
" this perfume is my absolute favorite!!! it smells so good. i love it! and this roll on is so easy. you can just pack it in your purse and use it whenever. its so convenient! but you won't have to really put it on several times day. once is enough. the scent carries on all day long! i highly recommend this fragrance as a gift to anyone ",positive
" i just love this product i felt like i was sitting on top of a cloud. i definately am going to by this again ",positive
" we really like this dish. it allows soap and water to drain through... you won't have the soap scum problem. it looks great and has rubber on the bottom and it won't slide around on you. ",positive

" frankincense contains sesquiterpenes which may help oxygenate the pineal and pituitary glands. as one of the ingredients for the holy incense it was used anciently to help enhance one's communication with the creator. it may help promote a positive attitude. ~ pg. 148 reference guide for essential oils by connie and alan higley bergamot oil is anti-inflammatory antiseptic and good for the skin. christopher columbus originally brought bergamot back to italy from the canary islands. frankincence oil is antiseptic and sedative together they are perfect for when you are feeling really stressed out or grumpy and want to relax. toss this in the tub and you will have a violet fizz that soon turns the water a beautiful silky purple. this may be the most beautiful lush bath and the essential oils make you feel more grounded. perfect as a bath before you do your relaxing yoga routine at night before bed. you may want to skip lotion after your bath and try the it's a pleasure treasure massage bar which is scented with myrrh. if you enjoy the bergamot in this product it is also in lush the olive branch and the comforter bubble bar. cynthia sylvia stout shampoo and veganese conditioner go well with this experience since they are also citrusy. i will agree this doesn't exactly have a blackberry scent but it is a beautiful violet colored bath that will impress with its calming and skin healing properties. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" this is my absolute favorite product by lush. i received a huge box of bath ballistics for my birthday and out of the whole thing this was the best! it made the water a nice purple color (without a ring around the tub) and made my skin smell great - even the next day! i would recommend this one to any first-timers so you can see what the buzz around lush is all about! i am stocking up on this one ",positive
" blackberry bath bomb is really relaxing. it turns the water a pretty purple color and smells sleepily sweet. it's fairly moisturizing too ",positive
" you can feel the huge difference when you put it on. it's really good for normal to oily skin. everytime i have a big pimple i put a tiny drop on it before i sleep next day the big pimple almost disappears. it's a magic cosmaetic i will recommand to everyone ",positive

" this vitamin e moisture cream has a great soft rosey smell and feels great on my skin. i was given a sample which i took home and tried and i was blown away by this product. i went back to our local mall a few days later and purchased the product. i love it ",positive
" this is a great product. the only reason i don't give it a full five stars is that it is alleged to not have 'significant' amounts of vitamin e which is supposed to be its selling point. i however buy it because for the five years or so that i have used this product i have gotten a lot of compliments about the firmness of my skin and since i have started using it my skin has actually become less oily than when i first started using it. i first purchased this product because of some damage i had done to my skin using a popular acne product. my skin looked and felt as though i had been burned by acid. i promptly stopped using that product and purchased this cream along with the cream cleanser because i hoped these products would be soothing. they definitely were. within a matter of weeks my skin started to feel better. moreoever it took on a plump more youthful appearance (no sagging!). within a month or so my skin was much less oily than it had been. since i first purchased this product i have strayed but have always come back. in the winter i use the heavier nightcream and have experienced the same results. the regular cream is pink in color and does not smell of perfume. texture wise it is heavier than a lotion but still feels slippery to the touch. i highly recommend you try this cream ",positive
" i love this soap. normally i'm not a bar soap person but this bar really has won me over. it smells divine and lasts forever. also my skin doesn't feel too tight or dry after a bath with this product. it is even a pretty color. what more could you ask for ",positive
" rock star soap appeals to my playful side and the scent in this soap leaves one a little giddy. the sweet vanilla fragrance is blended with perfumes and the result is something like a spicy vanilla and strawberry milkshake. can i say yum? this is absolutely delish and i think they may have added a little cinnamon to the mix. i love keeping lush soaps by the sink because they don't seem to dry out my hands as much as gel soaps. this one is perfect in combination with the smitten hand cream. rock star soap left me dreaming about buying other vanilla themed items like think pink (which i tried) creamy candy (a bubble bar) sympathy for the skin (which i'm dying to try) and honey trap (which i just tossed recklessly into my shopping cart). candy fluff sounds like it would go well with this experience. if you love this soaps creamy consistency gratuitous violets sultana of soap and alkmaar will impress. any chance the vanilla toothpaste will be listed here soon? wish wish... ~the rebecca review ",positive
" it has been over 4 hours since i showered and i still catch the scent as i move. it is such a sweet sugary smell that reminds me of summertime and pop music. this may sound like an odd description but it smells the way the inside of a jawbreaker tastes sweet and sugary. it also has a hint of cherry or strawberry to it. yum yum! i got two bars and cut one up into small cubes to wrap in cloth and put in my dresser drawers to scent my clothes. i love love love this stuff. the reviewer who said this only lasts a week must use a ton of soap (though who could blame her with a soap like this?)or take multiple baths/showers a day because i have used it for a week and it doesn't look any smaller than when i first opened it. it really helps to unwrap soap as soon as you get it so it can air harden before you use it. this helps it last longer. ",positive
" a word to the wise about size if this is your first time buying lush soap online be forewarned. you will receive a piece that is about 1 thick and 4-5 long. in other words you will be receiving a fairly small piece of soap. if you have a lush store near you i strongly recommend that you go and smell the huge chunks of soap they have on display. once you find a scent you like buy a  lb brick of it. it will cost a little over $20 but it is worth it if you find a soap you love. i also find that it is easier to experience the full scent of a soap with a bigger slice. i know that lush stores are few and far between (the closest one to me is about 35 miles away--not that far but too far to be convenient) but if you can grab a couple of friends and make a road trip out of it it's an adventure! now on to rock star. what a delightful soap. if you are a fan of the mmmm....melting marshmallows bath melt then you will also enjoy rock star. the scent is the same. it is also the same as snow fairy shower gel and the creamy candy bath melt. i cannot quite place my finger on the scent. the main ingredient in it is vanilla absolute but this smells much more sweet and girly. there is a definite floral scent lurking under the vanilla but i am at a loss to try and describe it! it sort of smells like warm cotton candy with a hint of brown sugar. it's the closest i can come to trying to describe the scent. the scent of rock star will linger on your skin for the entire day. it's absolutely wonderful. it also leaves your bathroom smelling wonderfully fresh. every time my husband uses the upstairs bathroom he has to come find me and ask what smells so good in our bathroom. it is a fabulously creamy soap and it lathers quite well. if you have white tile in your bathroom it will leave a pink lather pile on the tile but it is easy enough to wash off. there are a couple of minor downsides to rock star. but they are minor: 1. it melts way too fast. i just wished it lasted a bit longer. 2. it can leave the skin feeling a bit too squeaky clean. when i first started using rock star i thought it would give me dry skin but that hasn't been the case. it just feels a bit dry after showering. despite these small issues rock star is the perfect soap to make you feel a bit girly and a bit sexy all at the same time. ",positive
" i can't give this enough stars! truly love this! i just purchased a huge hunk from the herald square store! i'm well impressed with this soap! when i first got it from lush i was disappointed with the smell. it made me a bit sick. next day i hopped in the shower with it and started singing like a rock star! oh baby i love the smell! it's like a brand new smelly eraser you had when you were a kid! smells good enough to eat! this is on my must have list of items! gimme that fruity-candy goodness! if you adore it...layer it up with snow fairy and candy fluff...and float around in a haze of sweetness all day long! beware..can be very addicting once you use it!

" this soap smells great! smells just like a cherry lollipop! continues to smell even after the shower throughout the day. mix with i love juicy shampoo american cream conditioner and candy dusting powder ",positive
" there is actually science to support this serum and per a d magazine article several female dermatologists use it on their own skin. you spread a few drops on your face (and i use it on my neck and back of my hands as well) in the morning before sunscreen or makeup. it does not irritate my sensitive skin (i have rosacea and seb derm) or clog my pores. a lot of expensive products are just hype but i think the science and the fact that so many dermatologists use it make this one worth the money.

" sephora roll-up blotting paper is so handy. whenever you have to freshen up this is great to use before you powder your face. all you do is rip off the right about of paper you want and blot your face. they feel weightless and matte skin. just imagine all the oil that gets trapped into a powder puff. gosh. disgusting! best of all you get so much paper the roll is never-ending! it's so tiny and compact you would even want to share them with your friends ",positive
" this is one of the most perfect concealers i have ever used. it goes on nice and creamy (does not pull on your skin when applying) and covers those imperfections. you also do not need a lot of product to get the job done. the colors are very natural and i have found a perfect color in sand for me. i will buy this product again. ",positive
" i have been using this powder for about 5 years. it is amazing. i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. it even comes with the perfect application brush. this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do ",positive
" i did my christmas shopping in my warm fluffy nightgown. the package arrived before christmas. i did not pay for gas for shopping i did not fight for a parking space and i did not stand in long lines to pay for my prize. my mom's favorite cologne was also at least 10-20 dollars cheaper then the big stores overhead pricing. this is the way to go ",positive

" i bought this along with the some kind of gorgeous foundation faker. i don't have the best skin (oily) but like a more natural look. these two product together are so great. i look natural but healthier. and my skin stays less shiny all day. i use the other side of the foundation sponge to apply it ",positive
" i first got to smell this amazing perfume as a sample in a cosmo magazine. since then i could not help but want to keep smelling it over and over again. it reminds me alot of my perfume i use now but it smells so much more sweeter. i now use jovan white musk(love this one as well) but decided to try this perfume and fell in love with it as well. i love musky scents like this one. this perfume has a crisp warm and musky smell to it. i would highly recommend this perfume to any of the ladies out there that are looking for something to drive their man wild trust me it works wonders. i receive compliments all the time on this perfume and it has a long lasting affect that does not get sour or overpowering as it wears on throughout the daywhich most perfumes can do. i love this perfume what more can i say............other then i highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!! a personal tip i would like to suggest is to spray this perfume or any perfume of your choice on your hair just two quick sprays and the smell lasts much longer then on your skin. make sure your hair is dry and styled before doing this.

" i have tried ralph lauren's romance eau de parfum spray and i love its lush floral scent so romantic and sophisticated. i use it only on very special occasions and i've often been asked: what perfume are you wearing? it smells so good. i spray it behind my ears and wrists for a long-lasting effect. so leave a scent of you behind with ralph lauren romance eau de parfum spray. a perfume that means always and forever in bloom. wholeheartedly recommended. ",positive
" this is a really nice little bomb and smells of those little candy conversation hearts that come out for valentine's day each year. sort of tangy and light and sweet. but as with all that lush does there is a depth to this scent that makes it interesting enough to enjoy bathing in time and time again. the tonka oil in it is good for helping you to forgive yourself and for relaxation according to the first lush times catalog it appeared in so whenever i am having a bad day or kicking myself for making a silly mistake i bathe in this and feel better. it also has lavender for relaxation and neroli to uplift the spirits. the only downside to this bomb is that the scent doesn't linger much at all once you get out of the bath which is disappointing to me since it smells so good! still it is a worthy bath bomb and the cheery pink water and uplifting scent make it one i come back to time and time again ",positive
" i pulled the lid of the philosphy vanilla birthday cake bottle and inhaled the wonderful smell of vanilla birthday cake. it smells 100% like its glorious namesake. while some people complain about feeling strange bathing in birthday cake or a strawberry milkshake i think of it as being just another type of aromatherapy. cake makes me happy birthdays make me happy this birthday cake smelling body wash and shampoo really makes me happy! plus as a bodywash and shampoo it functions very well. my skin feels smooth and my hair feels light silky and not weighed down. my hair still smells a little like birthday cake which isn't as good the second day but it's not overpowering. i don't think i will use this as my everyday shampoo but it is great to throw in a gym bag for a quick after-workout shower ",positive
" okay so our moms said we shouldn't compare but i couldn't help it once i found sephora's powder brush. it's hair and handles above all the rest. used to think a brush was a brush was a brush which is probably why my rest includes artificial haired brushes that left powdered streaks on my face and one that shed whatever kind of hairs it possessed faster than a sheepdog in august. enough of my sad cosmetic catastrophes - this sephora brush is made of 100% goat hair fine and soft to pick up powder and allow you to apply either pressed or loose powder sleekly and smoothly. did i say it feels like silk on your skin? it does. additionally the brush hairs are rounded rather than cut straight across so its quick on the pick-up and consistently even on the distribution. of course it's good looking with a state-of-the art silver handle. it measures 8 inches - more importantly it measures up to everything a perfect powder brush should be. - gail cook ",positive
" this philosophy kit really works for people with consistant light to moderate acne. i've tried just about everything out there-prescription topicals & pills pro-activ and all the over the counter stuff. i have adult acne i never experienced acne as a teenager. when i first started using philosophy's kit i didn't notice a huge change in the first few weeks beyond pimples clearing up faster. around week 5 or 6 i began to notice that i wasn't waking up to a new zit every morning and i didn't feel oily at the end of the day. now i have been using for 4 months and feel like a new person. i don't have to cover my face with concealer or retouch make-up throughout the day. i can walk out the door with just powder on my face for the first time in years! i would recommend this kit to anyone who can't use benzoyl peroxide and is frustrated with all the other products on the market ",positive
" i have tried i think every product on the market. nothing was helping my acne it just kept getting worse. i still have a bad complexion but nothing like it used to be after trying this. i loved it. it did dry my skin out a little but whatever works! my skin is clearer and smoother it just isn't perfect but who is ",positive

" hi i just wanted to let everyone out their know: that this stuff works. i have had problematic hormonal acne since the age of 21. i'm 27 now. after i graduated from the university and started working a real job the stress went straight to my face (you all know what i am talking about). unfortunately for me i am allergic to benzyl peroxide and i have extremely sensitive skin. i also do not do well with tea tree oils and most sulfur and acidic products (basically anything that can kill acne - leaves my face itchy- either swollen like a tomato or is ineffective and i have painful acne bumps...which would you rather do?). i was a little hesitant after reading the ingredients and noticed that the cleanser had sulfur in it and there was also a jar of pure salicylic acid for blemishes. but after using other philosophy products for my hair and body - i decided to give it a try. hell what's another 50 bucks if it can clear my acne - and if not i can always send it back. i started using it about 3 weeks ago and my skin has had a tremendous transformation. i finally feel like my acne is under control. i recommend this product fully and it is my duty to tell everyone this after suffering with relentless acne for so many years. the cleanser is awesome and needs to be in a larger size. the blemish serum is extremely drying so if you are sensitive like me read the directions and take it slow - don't reapply throughout the day until your skin is ready. the day and night face creams are cool. the day one is kind of like glue and seals in the treatment - the entire day! that's why it works because it is on your face until night time when you wash (i can even faintly smell the product). then you use your night hydrogen peroxide cream yes not benzyl. yeah this cream is intense as well. so take it slow until your skin is ready. one thing that i do recommend is that if you wear make-up use the purity cleanser (not in the kit) to initially clean your skin and then use the acne cleanser. that's what i do and it works for me - so i will share it with you. another thing i do is i will take a little bit of the hope is not enough spf moisturizer and put on very little on my super dry areas. remember this acne kit is intense and you may be prone to drying out and peeling - so some oil-free moisturizer can help hydrate the area around the acne. well that's about it. i hope this helps you and let's you know that your acne can be tamed and doesn't have to run your life. take care m. rodriguez surprise az ",positive

" the shade i use is subtle lips. i love it! it gives some color but not so much that i feel done up. i could be in complete casual clothes and throw it on and feel great. and yet it looks great on sundays too. because of the mild color it matches everthing. and unlike lip gloss it's not sticky at all. (i can't tolerate any stickiness!) i am only somewhat picky about scent and taste and to me this one has neither. i think it is by far worth the $20!! ",positive

" glamorous mysterious seductive all describe armani code a captivating orange blossom based scent from giorgio armani fragrance. as one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem. tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top. adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by lace embroidery on the glass. the scent is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest. with orange blossom at its heart armani code is enhanced by sambac jasmine madagascan vanilla and honey. the man in my life called it delicious and i do too. it's now high on my list of favorite fragrances. - gail cook ",positive
" this one could appeal to a variety of fragrance lovers as it seems to find that middle ground in preferences. it's not too spicy not sickeningly sweet. it's not trying to do too much. just effortless. one thing i like about this you're not at risk at dousing yourself and offending other noses. i hate smelling or leaving a trail of perfume in the air. this one has restraint. staying power is debatable but it's such a wonderful confident woman scent i gave it 5 stars ",positive
" this is one of the most beautiful sexy scents currently on the market. if you are a gourmand/oriental fragrance lover (examples of which include thierry mugler's angel or angel innocent bvlgari's omnia calvin klein's euphoria or burberry's brit - all of which i own and wear regularly without longevity issues - see next paragraph) then i would highly recommend this fragrance. sweet but in a sexy subtle musky way. i would bathe myself in this fragrance if i could. and i should. as noted by the previous reviewer this fragrance is gone in flash. i give myself about 5 hearty sprays of this in the morning including two directly misted onto my clothing in an effort to extend the fragrance but it is gone by noon. this is truly perplexing. every other giorgio armani frangrance that i own including sensi emporio she and armani code for men (also great for women) can go the distance. this is supposed to be eau de parfum but wears very much like eau de toilette. someone seriously skimped on the oil base. it that doesn't trouble you terribly pick this one up. if you want something similar that will last through the entire day and most of the night and particularly love the musk component of this fragrance then i would wholeheartedly recommend checking out narciso rodriguez's for her or musc for her instead ",positive

" i am very impressed with the whole bobbi brown line. this lip gloss is no exception. these lip glosses come in tubes with wands that have a small lip brush on the end. the colors are fantastic. these glosses are all very neutral and natural looking colors. none of these glosses are going to make you look too made up; just make you look finished. the texture is not too tacky or sticky. and it has a light scent not very strong and overall its a very good lip gloss. i highly recommend these lip glosses and will continue to purchase them.

" i have thick and very coarse hair (as you read in the title) that i am trying to grow out and i have tried everything before to help tame the mane. i always look for a product that not only puts back moisture into my hair but something that can fortify it as well to prevent more damage. i've tried almost every single intensive conditioner in the stores and tried a lot in the salons as well however this one i came across by accident. my aunty had gone to a frederic fekkai promo sale and bought a whole bunch of stuff. it didn't really do much for her hair so she passed them on to me to try. some of the stuff i wasn't too impressed with but this hair mask did wonders for my hair! after just one use i could totally tell a difference in the feel and texture of my hair. usually i have to straighten or blow dry my hair when its wet to tame it however this product i didn't have to do too much after. i let my hair air dry and just put in a anti-frizz cream after and that was good. the mask washes out clean (no greasy residue) so this product is really good for weekly restoration. but from what it seems like this hair mask (along with all products i suppose) work for some people and not for others. your best bet is to get your hands on a sample size before you shell out the money for a full tube since it can be kind of expensive ",positive
" i got a free sample of this product at a nordstroms trend show and decided to use it the other day. my hair is pretty course and frizzy and long but it is also more kinky curls instead of big round ringlets. well i let my hair air dry then applied a serum to take care of the frizz. then i put some in my hair (you don't need much) and scrunched and twisted my hair. it worked wonderfully! my hair was bouncy and had lots of volume and was very shiny and curly the best i have ever seen it! i got a lot of compliments on it too. the only thing is that if you use too much your hair gets too shiny and looks oily also it doesnt have much hold at all so a good hair spray really does the trick with this. besides that it is a wonderful curl enhancer ",positive
" anyone who gave this lotion a low rating simply did so because they don't realize achieving great curly hair is a process. there is no one product that can do all the work. i have thick frizzy damaged curly hair. i use this lotion after using my favorite shine serum then after letting air dry for a few minutes finish with gel or mousse for hold. the curl enhancing lotion really really improves the look of my curls - from uneven ringlets and loose waves to an almost universal loose big curl - it's beautiful! the only downside is the tiny bottle for such a high price. it should be at least 8oz ",positive
" i love this light curing lotion! it smells like orange/vanilla creamsicle. it enhances the curls in my naturally curly hair makes it more moisturized and smells great! it has no hold so if you need hold you'll need to use a gel over it. love it and worth the $s ",positive

" i first got a whiff of this from a magazine enclosure. it got me curious as they rarely do. passing sephora i went in for a test...and felt seduced by the classy charm of the scent. it seemed to have a rich sophistication which goes with horseback riding or polo. after a few days i still couldn't get the scent out of my head so i went back to grab it up. i've only had this experience with a few other fragrences...but they were of a totally different style...angel by thierry mugler and flower by kenzo ",positive
" the perfume is very subtle with a little hint of sweetness. it's not overpowering or musky. don't try to sniff the bottle or a sample...it won't do it justice. you have to try it on your skin to know how great it smells. i've had other designer frangrances but this is by far my favorite and i've received a lot of compliments ",positive
" all of the bbare escentuals are great! they make you look so young and fresh. i am 61 and people say i look 40! even my daugther like it! she is very hard to please. great buy and last a long long time. thanks!!!! ",positive
" i order the ash color for blondes and found that it is just the right color. i also purchased the anastasia brow stensils with this item and finally seem to have found a solution for my thin mismatched brow problem. i have ordered many bare escentuals products and love all of them ",positive
" i was pleasantly suprised when i received this gift set. the bottles are much larger than i had anticipated. also the bag is super cute. ",positive
" feel sexy and tingly without the burn of most lip plumping products. your lips will be glossy shiny and soft when you use this product ",positive
" i have tried every lip plumper on the market (no joke) and this is the best (besides pure cinnamon leaf oil which burns like hell). i use b.e. products and i bought a couple of these bc i liked the colors. i was not expecting it to work as well as it did. now it is all i use on my lips! it makes your lips feel cool not burning ",positive
" i am new to the world of gloss and haven't tried that many brands but this is definitely on my keeper list. if you want something that plumps i would look elsewhere but if your looking for a subtle gloss that smells great and gives your lips a nice chilled feeling this is the gloss for you. ",positive
" i am so happy they are selling this now outside the gift set.. i have never had a lip gloss that tastes and looks and feels as great as this does! i have amber and dolly and plan to try a few other of the colors as its the best i have ever tried! ",positive
" i love this stuff. i ordered it at a friends body shop party a while back. i use it each moring after i shower and it keeps my lips soft all day! i tried to find something like this in the stores but nothing even came close to being as good as this!!! i highly reccomend it ",positive
" very good product and great kind of fruity smell. leave hair soft and full of bounce. easy to comb hair after using this product but might be combine with kerastase conditionner for very dry and damage hair if your hair are very long. the price here is still more expensive than in europe: around 22 euros ",positive
" these pencils are the best!they are the perfect texture and they last a long time ",positive
" i love this product - it's a lot more natural looking than foundation and saves a step in the morning. it does a good job evening out skin tone and it feels good on my dry skin. as someone who doesn't wear a lot of makeup it adds that extra bit of polish that makes for a more professional appearance without looking too made up ",positive
" i try a lot of products and this is simply my favorite. not only do they feel luxurious they look amazing in my bathroom. i sent my mom a set and she loves it too ",positive
" hey i have been using min shampoo on/off for about six months and can no longer go off the stuff because when i do there is dramtic difference. as far as the smell goes i don't need to smell like a coconut or a bloomingsdale just make it pleasant or oderless and give texture and fullness to my hair. i don't think it smells medicated (unlike reviogen) but just doesn't have too strong of an oder. if more people knew of this product more people would be happier with their hair. ",positive
" let me say that this is the best skin care cream i have ever used and i know for a fact that it works because so many dermatologists stand behind it. i've used it for a little over a year now and i won't use anything else. i don't know the last time i ever had to use an exfoliating scrub because what this does is an automatic scrub. it is gradually sloughing off dead skin cells for you and rendering the use of exfoliaters useless. i must say it has a natural funky smell but you do adapt to that very quickly and won't notice it after a while. you use it once a day for the first two weeks (while your skin gets used to it) and then twice a day thereafter if you want. i only use it at night and a sunscreen throughout the day because the skin is a little more sensitive to the sun. caution - this is an acid cream. i once had a minor paper cut on my finger (the same that i use to dip into the pot) and i still get tears in my eyes thinking of the pain i was in. this is an excellent cream and i strongly recommend it. it won't get rid of wrinkles (you have to know that there is practically nothing on the market that will get rid of them) but it will soften the look of wrinkles and it will give your skin a beautiful softness and glow. it's an amazing cream with true genuine results ",positive
" laura mercier is by far and away my very very favorite line of lip color. over the years i have tried hundreds of lipsticks glosses pots pencils you name it. laura's are the best. here's why i like them: 1. color is natural and semi-sheer so it looks light-weight no matter what the shade 2. colors are not garish - you won't be throwing them out next season. not to say that they are boring just timeless and well thought out. 3. they last a long time. not all day but i really hate those all day lip colors. by mid-day my lips are so dry and gross-flakey. i've thrown away more of those cruddy all day lip colors than i care to remember. back to the point my laura lipstick easily lasts me through a 2-hour presentation to a client. 4. i only wear the shimmer line in fall and guess what? metallics are so in for fall 2005 ",positive
" it smells as pretty and pink as it looks. it's not to gooey like other shower gels and i will definately repurchase it when i run out ",positive
" this liner is thin as advertised goes on easy stays and is really nice stuff. be warned though the lightest shade is really light and only good if you're really pale. it barely shows on me - i'm really pale with strawberry blonde hair and even i should've gone darker on the color. recommended ",positive
" i found it to have a little too much 'yellow' for my brows (i have blonde/grey hair but it performs well and i like the slim point. i just mix in a little of my charcoal to soften the yellow ",positive
" i'm nearly forty and i'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight. i got this cream and have been using it along with mbt trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer. after one month i'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously-lumpy legs. i can't say that it would work wonders alone but as an add-on to an exercise program it seems to be helping quite a lot. i've done weight-loss programs before and they've never addressed the cellulite issue. this is the first thing that has seemed to work. and it's great moisturizer too. ",positive
" my husband wears this everyday and i just love it!!! i like to spray my pillow with it when he's out of town!! great smell! ",positive
" this is a very rich creme. i find it works best for me if i use it all over my face once or twice a week. my face breaks out if i use it more often. i am 63 years old so blemishes are not a common occurrence for me. another alternative would be to use it only on the brow and under the eyes but in that case i would recommend the strivectin-sd eye creme which does not have the mint fragrance. ",positive
" i bought some less than a week ago. i've been using it over my brows between my eyes and under my eyes (although the directions say not to). already the fine lines under my eyes have decreased dramatically. i love the tingly feel of it as well. it's super expensive here in canada ($200 a tube) but so far it's worth the price. i'd definately buy it again ",positive
" unbelievable results was considering botax when i heard about this product thought to try. i have used several other products never saw results like strivectin-sd. used it as directed mainly between brows on top of the lips and the neck. within two weeks noticeable results especially around the lip area and the neck. have been using it for over 30 days family and friends are noticing it. thank you for a great product. got all my friends start using. can't wait to try the eye cream just heard about it ",positive
" brush applicator puts it exactly where i want. gives my lips a great wet look without being messy. never bleeds & lasts for hours without touch-ups. this is the only gloss i'll use ",positive
" i have been using this product for about a year. i love it. it is a rich non greasy formula that gives my skin a healthy glow. i use it alone and under daily makeup. great for mature skin ",positive
" these are great if you have oily or combination skin. just press onto your face and it instantly takes away the oil and the shine. it won't ruin your makeup and you can use them discreetly almost anywhere anytime. these are very similar to the blotting sheets sold by mac cosmetics -- except these are cheaper and work just as great. i've even caught my boyfriend using it on his face so i guess it would be great for a metrosexual. lol!!! you'll love these as much as i do. ",positive
" i have loved this product for so many years but haven't found it for more than ten. i flew to spain and the evian was an absolute necessity! it's just the right amount of cool water as opposed to splashing water on your face out of a faucet. it is very refreshing and also brightens fading makeup. ",positive
" love this for hot summer days dry winter days and hot flashes :) a must have for catching the vapors also good when out in the sun.. ",positive
" great for flying..... keeps your skin & nose from drying out ",positive
" great for after the gym.... great for winter dry skin. love it!!! ",positive
" well... i gotta say this one feels good refreshing cool & calming. gives the same feeling you get after you've just washed your face. ",positive
" i absolutely love clinique for eye shadow. all of their eye shadows go on so smooth never crease and are just the perfect shades of colors for my skin tone. the almost peach color is great because i can use it as a highlighter under my brow or just as a base either way i use it just about every day! : ",positive
" this scent has sweet floral undertones but with a light clean effect. many perfumes make me sneeze but not this line. i get many compliments while wearing this. i sometimes layer it with amazing grace another scent in the philosophy line. you won't be disappointed ",positive
" i have been using this powder for about 5 years. it is amazing. i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. it even comes with the perfect application brush. this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do ",positive
" i first bought this product because the woman at the store said that it renewed the skin bringing newer skin to the surface. and she added that it helps pull pimples out to the surface so you can get rid of them easier i was a little wary a first but it works. my skin feels softer and looks more even all around. ",positive
" it helps you dry and burns the wattery thing inside your face out. this is a non toxic device used to heat up the pimples until it get small and dry. this product is better than proactiv. proactive does not work on my face instead it irritates and get worst. try to wash your face with dove skin soap for more than 1hr to soften your face and remove the pus. then path it dry and use zeno and don't over use this product because it might hurt and burn your skin. failure to use this product properly might cause 1st degree burn. never use any chemicals on your face while using this product. for excessive large pimples i see some people apply a clean duct tape on their face keep it for 3-8 hrs and remove it. you would notice that all pus are lying on your face and you just need to clean it using clean water and a skin soap. the regular price of this product is $150 for 60 treatment cycle. ",positive
" i am seeing results after three weeks. i love this stuff ",positive
" i am a hair fanatic... test and try everything. this comb is the best comb i've come across for my hair. i have a lot of thick hair so this comb really does the job. i have been using avon combs for over 5 years now and love them. very strong and don't break easily. because my hair is thick i still need to use conditioner to help detangle it other wise my hair would be ruined. worth every penny and for $4.99 you can't lose. ",positive
" for over 7 years i have been battling adult acne rosacea with little success. i have used prescribed creams facialists otc products diet changes etc. with minimal effects. with the onset of winter i wanted to ensure my face was moisturized with the very low humidity. while ordering a mister from amazon i noticed many people also ordered the body shop vitamin e face mist. i thought why not? the results were almost immediate! the redness and breakouts have greatly diminished and i'm once again getting comments from people on how very nice my skin is looking. you couldn't ask for an easier application and it doesn't give my skin a claustraphobic feeling. and the rose water scent is revitalizing and calming. this is the best thing i've used in over 6 years. i wholeheartedly recommend it especially to premenopausal women who are experiencing skin dryness ",positive
" is there anyone who doesn't know the name sarah jessica parker? okay. think carrie on tv's enormously successful sex and the city. she was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. she brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance lovely sarah jessica parker. it's a unique almost indescribable blend of classicism chic and innocence. there's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh mandarin bergamot lavender and apple martini. vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. middles notes are patchouli tender paper whites and luxe orchid. these are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber sensuous cedar and the very sultry musk. this is a scent i revel in and enjoy wearing. the bottle is of course simple and exquisite curved with polished glass ultra feminine. lovely sarah jessica parker is a beautiful dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion. - gail cooke ",positive
" eyeshadow in the world. being new to this makeup line this kit was en excellent addition. the colors vanilla sugar eye shadow (a light creamy peach) fashionista liner shadow (a rum raisin/brown)peach puff eyeshadow (creamy peach) and explore soft focus eye shadow (medium brown) all blend together so that you cannot tell where one color starts and the other begins. applying your bareminerals foundation first glues it all on. the included booklet guides you along. being in my 40's natural looking is the name of the game for me. no glitter sparkles heavy eye liners etc. this kit accomplished that. i got brave and tried the foiling effect and fell in love ! the colors did not migrate the liner stayed in place for over 12 hours and i had no eye irritation at all. do yourself a favor and try this out ! you will never go back to other eye makeup. i recommend this to everyone i know you won't be dissappointed ",positive
" i use the whole vitament e series (cleanser toner spf-15 day cream lip balm and the nourishing night cream). after a year in the desert my skin still looks great. i just turned 40 and was carded for buying alcohol last month.! these are gentle products and work extremely well ",positive
" this is a perfect winter cream for me and would probably work for anyone else who has very dry skin (e.g. you rub eucerin on at night). it is very similar to the regular cream in appearance (pink) and smell (not offensive) but it is much heavier. i started using this during the winter when i discovered the regular cream wasn't heavy enough and it works just as well. it spreads on pretty easily for such a thick cream and when i wake up my skin is dewy and moisturized. ",positive
" i wear stay neutral and have been using this product for years. doesn't clog pors and it looks flawless. this is a really great product and work the $18.00 ",positive
" okay so i love love love this kit. it includes everything you need to have awesome brows except the aestician..lol. i look forward to see what else this young lady presents us with ",positive
" as a fragrance addict i will try anything once- but i am hooked on this stuff. i don't often purchase solid perfumes as all of the ones i have tried tend to be greasy feeling on and don't last very long. this is completely different- it's easy to apply but isn't at all greasy and last quite a while. this scent is beautiful and floral/spicy and not overpowering. if you enjoy lovely by sarah jessica parker i think you'll enjoy this too- plus you can take it anywhere- it's only as big as a tube of lipstick. finally beauty habit sent me a little handwritten note of thanks and a little bag of perfume and lotion samplers with my order. i can't wait to try the other scents by crazylibellule and the poppies and i would definitely shop again with beauty habit. good stuff ",positive
" this product works great for bodywash but is much too thick to be a shampoo ",positive
" i absolutely love the smell of philosophy's cinnamon buns. like the other reviewers have said it doesn't last long after the shower but it is a nice way to wake up in the morning. even my husband likes it and he is really picky about anything scented. i only use it as a shower gel and not a shampoo so it lasts pretty long making it worth the expense. i like the other cinnamon buns products also - i use the cream and the lip gloss ",positive
" this is a sweet treat! it smells good enough to eat. it also leaves my skin smooth and soft. it works good as a shampoo on my thick wavy hair too. cinnamon buns 3-in-1 is a wonderful product and everyone should buy it. totally worth the $dough$. ha ha ",positive
" like someone else said i don't have a problem paying for a high quality beauty item that works as it says it does. cinnamon buns has a great lather smells wonderful when you use it and makes your skin soft. i have used it as a shampoo and the scent lingers a bit longer using it on your hair but it really doesn't function as well as a shampoo as it does as a shower gel. for a bubble bath ya have to use so much of it i just can't do it. i find myself counting the ounces i'm pouring under the faucet and have decided to use it as a treat only. the smell doesn't last very long but have found that it does linger longer if you lather rinse and repeat like it says on the bottle. it's a dollar an ounce.....not sure if i'll try any of the other 'flavors' simply because of the cost ",positive
" i have very sensitive skin a thick beard and must shave daily. what a hellacious combination! the art of shaving for sensitive skin is the best shaving cream i have found...and i have been searching far and wide. as for the rest of their products...eh i could take them or leave them...i.e. there are similar products you can acquire much cheaper. this shaving cream in particular has no alcohol and all kinds of natural ingredients including a bunch of non-comudegenic (sp?) oils that really protect your skin. ",positive
" i have mixed feelings about philosophy products. for one thing they have really done a number on my skin as far as drying certain areas of my skin out. on the other hand i use to have a very congested skin and nose area but i have noticed a huge difference in the congestion of my skin when using when hope is not enough serum. i haven't noticed any lifting but the line between my eyebrows has softened. as far as reducing facial hair growth don't count on it. i am only giving this 4 stars because even though it has helped keep my congestion under control it hasn't done much more than that and i think it is a bit pricy for being just an exfoliator ",positive
" philosophy products have really changed my skin and i know this is true because the times i have run out of philosophy products and replaced them with even very expensive department store brands my skin starts breaking out and looking blotchy uneven and tired. then i remember how much philosophy does for me and i absolutely have to reorder. if you buff your face with the microdelivery peel wash thoroughly with purity cleanser then follow with this product when hope is not enough serum then hope in a jar moisturizer on your entire face and neck your skin will just glow and you will be amazed how fast blemishes and blotches just go away and don't come back! after using the microdelivery peel my skin looks 75% better right away. after a week of using all the products my skin is clear and glowing. i really believe in these products. they feel great smell great and work great ",positive
" i had tried all kinds of skin care systems with different levels of success but in the end the derma step system works the best with long lasting results. you can get a free trial and see for yourself here: http://things4free.biz/dermaste ",positive
" this products delivers what it promises. i bought it as part of the makeup optional kit and now i am ordering 2 so that i don't run out. my skin is missing it so badly. i discovered good skin i never knew i could have so i must have this product. the antioxidants really deliver and roll back the years to reveal younger skin. this is my favourite then secondly the purity made simple third the hope is not enough spf cream ",positive
" i have been on the search for a new makeup and have been disappointed in so many so i have been pleasantly surprised with how much i like the pur minerals. i sets nicely and i don't feel made up. i like that there are no chemicals in it as i have pretty sensitive skin. this is not a heavy makeup so if you're looking for max coverage this is not for you. i love the mineral glow too. it gives me the perfect glow without looking fake. i will be buying this again ",positive
" i recently converted to using powder makeup. i am hooked. i didn't tell anyone i was using it. my son was the first person to tell me how nice i looked! that truly made my day and was all the convincing i needed. i absolutely love it because it is flawless and does not feel goopy like liquid foundation ",positive
" this pur minerals starter kit is a great introduction to this brand. i am absolutely in love with the 4-in-1 pressed mineral makeup (included in the kit). it's so much better than the bare escentuals makeup which i had been using for years. the 4-in-1 provides great coverage as it is a foundation concealer and spf 15 pressed powder all in one. with bare escentuals i was having to buy the mineral veil foundation and concealer all separately and i still felt like my dark circles and blemishes were not covered well. pur minerals is a wonderful makeup very lightweight and even the brush is soft on my skin! i highly recommend it ",positive
" having been blessed with very large pores on my nose and cheeks i was looking for something that might help reduce the appearance of my pores. they seem to enlarge as i age. came across this product somewhat by accident. i was really amazed at how well it works. just a small dollop tapped lightly on the skin and your pores vanish and your skin looks perfectly smooth. it mattifies the skin all day (and i have extra oily skin). other clinique products have made my skin break out but this stuff is wonderful if you suffer from acne on your nose or cheeks. highly recommended ",positive
" this is the best shaving product in the whole wide world. if you exfoliate first and then use it nothing gets smoother legs for me & my sensitive skin. yes it seems kind of expensive but you just need a tiny bit at a time in a thin layer so it actually lasts longer for me than several bottles of regular shave gel. it also takes up less space ",positive
" i bought this as a gift for my head-shaving husband. he is very happy with his close shave and i have used it as well for my legs. a tiny bit goes a long way and it provides a very close smooth shave. the downside is the cost; it's hard to justify that much for an everyday shaving gel. ",positive
" even swimming for two hours in the pool i still have mascara when i emerge from the water. would not be without this! ",positive
" this product works very well on my fair nordic and sensitive skin. it covers well but with a light non-oily feeling and combined with a fluff og powder it leaves my skin looking flawless. i highly recommend this product. ",positive
" i'm not a big perfume girl. i mean i love the pretty bottles and tend to store up the really antique (or antique-y looking) ones. but i generally prefer essential oils over perfume. that said out of the dozens that i own i keep three on hand at all times. (four if you count the little mini i got from spacenk) santa maria novella for rubbing on my ankles. i know it's a bit mature but it reminds me of italy. and monks. chanel mademoiselle because my mother always taught me to love chanel and i just prefer that scent to the others. and marc jacobs because to be honest if i had to choose the loveliest this would be it. it's lovely and light. not too over powering. affordable. and gets tons of compliments. also comes in cute bottle. : ",positive
" this is not a strong floral fragrance and not sweet but it smells wonderful. it just gets better and better on your skin. very complex very different ",positive
" if i had to choose a fragrance that was the most feminine i've ever smelled it would be marc jacobs. yes it's a gardenia based scent but definitely not your typical musty heavy gardenia by any means. marc jacobs is different in that it is a 'wet gardenia' like you're smelling a bunch of gardenias that have been swirling around in a bowl of fresh water. intoxicatingly alluring. the notes of this fragrance are: gardenia wild muguet skin musk cedar ginger. the gardenia in this is faint but lovely. it isn't a knock-you-out strong gardenia but very mellow and mesmerizing. it'll follow you like a breath of fresh air and you'll have people sniffing the air you leave behind. :) if you've ever smelled michael by michael kors this is different. michael is not gardenia but it is a tuberose scent. it is very strong creamy heavy and thick. if you like michael you may like marc jacobs as your spring/summer alternative. they're in the same family in terms of florals and such but different in terms of how they wear. marc jacobs being flowy and michael being heavy. the 1.7 oz. retails at $65 and the 3.4 oz. at $85. it's quite expensive but it does have that brand-name smacked on the front. :) i think it's worth it. the lasting power is decent. even when you may feel it is gone it's not and people will compliment you. try it out and see how you like it on your skin ",positive
" my husband and i sat next to a woman on our flight to prague who smelled absolutely delicious. a asked her what fragrance she was wearing and she replied marc jacobs. i remember it was fresh and clean and subtly floral without being overly sweet. now - 6 months later - i came across it in lord & taylor sprayed a tester on my wrist and instantly remembered why the fragrance was so captivating. without more than 30 seconds of contemplation i purchased the gift set - can't wait to experience this fresh winning scent over and over again. ",positive
" for a long time i avoided anything with gardenia like a plague-it always smelled too sickly sweet to me. this perfume changed my mind completely-yes there is gsrdenia but its very light and fresh and unlike any gardenia you've ever smelled. try it for yourself ",positive
" my boyfriend used to search online stores for the french cologne jean patou pour homme because it was the only upscale cologne he would wear (it was awesome!). however it is not produced anymore and is very hard to find and very expensive. he searched high and low to find a replacement and this is it! sean john unforgivable is surprisingly good. masculine but not too musky or cheap smelling. now this is all my boyfriend will wear - and i'm not complaining! guys - women will love how you smell when you wear this. women - buy this for your boyfriends/husbands but only let them wear it when they're on a date with you! :) anyway it's worth the cost and it's our new favorite. ",positive
" i love this it smells so good diddy struck gold with this one as he always says preserve the sexy & this is sex ",positive
" i have to say that i was quite impressed with this fragrance. i tend to look the other way when a product receives a little too much hype or attention. i can't say that this cologne is worth a great deal of hype but i can say that it has a pleasant and disctinctive odor. the cologne is not something you would wear on a daily basis but would go very well with a suit on a special occasion. on the bad side along with the cologne's elegant odor comes a slightly feminine aroma. while i am not one to prefer a musky cologne i could do without smelling like a woman. an additional downside would be it's high cost per ounce... overall since receiving the cologne as a gift i am quite pleased with adding this fragrance to my collection. good job diddy daddy puff... ",positive
" i have never smelled any cologne as good as this. unforgivable is absolutely wonderful! i saw diddy on several talk shows promoting this fragrance and thought here we go... another famous person in the perfume industry - not gonna be any good. so i go shopping the other day and see a tester bottle. i had to try it. sprayed it on the little piece of paper and immediately asked the sales clerk to give me the biggest bottle they had. it is amazing. my boyfriend comes home from work i present him with the cologne and he wasn't thrilled (not into colognes and such) but promises to try it anyway. he didn't hate it!!! and that's about as thrilled as he gets about anything so i knew then it was a good thing. i just can't quit smelling him his clothes his car - everything smells unforgivable! we went out with some friends for dinner and drinks and both of my girlfriends pulled me aside to ask what cologne he was wearing - they wanted to buy it for their guys too! now i can't wait for the women's fragrance to come out... seanjean definitely has a winner here ",positive
" lush makes a few products with lemon but i think this is one of the best because it has coconut oil for deep conditioning and it is a little intoxicating with the scent of vetivert. the earthy fragrance may appeal to your wilder side if you enjoy the jungle conditioner which also contains vetivert oil. use this conditioner after the daddy-o shampoo and all you can imagine you are walking through fields of lavender drinking a coconut milkshake. i can also recommend the honey trap lip balm and the smitten hand cream. all that jas is also a wonderful product for the bath. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" when i first got the package delivered to me at work my assistant and i were smelling all the products... this one made both of us scrunch our noses in distaste. but when i got home and actually applied it to my hair it smelled nothing like the nasty old lady smell i had detected before. the reason why i have given this product 5 stars is because i feel that this conditioner has been unfairly graded here. the conditioner is for people with curly or processed hair -- meaning if you have straight thick hair this conditioner may seem like a waste of money due to the amount of product you have to apply. also as us girls with curly hair know not all curly hair is equal. some have thick springy curls that gets curlier the shorter the cut it while others have a thinner quality to their hair which actually gets curlier the longer it gets. i'm the later and i think this is why this product works for me. i can understand how this may seem misleading to those with the thicker curl types but i'm here to set the record straight on that one. i hope it helps in deciding if this product is right for you ",positive
" i really like this conditioner from lush. i wash my hair everyday and because of this (and long soaks in the bath) my hair gets pretty dry. this conditioner is absorbed really quickly and doesn't have an overpowering scent. i am not a huge fan of coconut but this and the shampoo makes my hair smell like a tropical cocktail which i think is really nice. i wouldn't use it every day and don't recommend it unless you have dry hair that needs a bit of extra care. i have used american cream but i think coolaulin is better at least for my hair. i have thick straight mid-length hair. great conditioner to make hair soft but strong and also shiny ",positive
" moisturize and refresh yourself as you relax in this foamy bath. your stress will soak away and you'll feel truly happy ",positive
" i really enjoyed this bomb - it was very refreshing and relaxing. it is a big bomb and i could have broken it in half but i didn't want to risk missing a thing! so far i have been happy with my lush purchases and my favorite bomb is sex bomb but i would buy this one again or give it as a gift ",positive
" after suffering from a terrible cold all week i finally succumbed to a hot bath. i had to rummage through my box filled with lush products ( gift from a thoughtful boyfriend) when i pulled out this huge disc and broke out half while saving the other for one more bath. i didn't even know what this was called but the minute it touched the water refreshing and invigorating essences of lemons and milky cream escaped my nose i felt happy in an instant it was amazing! even thought my nose refused to recognize scent for days i smelled the oils and citrusy botanicals the bath water filled with tiny bubbles and i soaked my cold and stress away. after the bath i felt great my skin and bones felt refreshed and i was warm cozy and felt a lot better. after looking it up online i was really surprised to see that this was called the happy pill because it really did make me happy. i am really looking forward to using the other half hopefully when i'm not sick anymore. once again lush came through for me with the products they so lovingly create and i cannot recommend their bath bombs enough. whether taken as a fun bath product or to relieve cold or sadness they always work in gentle and relaxing ways. the main ingredients in this little love ball are good skin nourishers such as olive oil hemp oil grapefruit oil bergamot oil frankincense oil lemon oil grange flower absolute mandarin oil gardenia extract ( yum!) and sodium bicarbonate. happy bathing! - kasia s.

" olive oil moisturizes while grapefruit lemon oil and mandarin orange oil refresh. this is a large foaming bath treat that looks like a big fizzy orange vitamin pill that you put in water. it seems to foam slowly and eventually i broke it into pieces to help the process along. it kept fizzing and foaming creating tiny orange and yellow islands within the bubbles (i added some bubble bath first - you might want to try some happy hippy shower gel). eventually the water turned creamy (olive oil and hemp oil) and this bath reminded me of a creamsicle. bergamot orange flower and gardenia also make this a beautiful calming bath that leaves you in a good mood. this bath is fun with the lemslip buttercream. i keep applying some whoosh temple balm to my wrists and happily inhaling deeply. this bath made me feel warm and snuggly and in the mood for lemon meringue pie or lemon sugar cookies or lemon tea. this is a good bath for the morning or evening depending on your mood. i was drinking celestial seasonings tension tamer extra with this lush experience. if you love happy hippy shower gel this fun bath product will impress you. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" i tried the apple cider clarifying shampoo on a reccomendation from a saleswoman at sephora. i have never been happier with a shampoo. i have fine/ oily hair and product buildup is a problem for me. after using this it felt like i just left a salon. my hair was shiny squeaky clean it had body and was sooo soft. i also got several comments from people at work about how good my hair smelled. i only use it about once a week not only to conserve (it is pretty pricey per ounce) but also it's clarifying so i don't want to dry out my scalp (this has happened to me before). so i shampoo and condition with other products during the week ",positive
" i love zoya polish. it is pure and the colors are fabulous. they stay and stay and stay. i'm ready to order again ",positive
" i love zoya nail polish and this is the best summer color ever ",positive
" the best i have smelled. put this on your babies momma and you'l be smooching all night long. you just wont wanna let your woman go. if you r a woman buying this your man will go crazy for you and if he doesnt i will. lol ",positive
" this is not my first purchase from iman cosmetics. i love the coverage the powder gives and the color compliments me very well. i would definitely purchase this powder again ",positive
" this is new for me. i have been trying to switch all products to zoya due to the formadahyde free formulas. so far so good ",positive
" much better in terms of coverage than the new loreal makeup that diane keaton touts which is more creamy but just doesn't cover as well. avon's mousse foundation goes on almost like a powder but doesn't block my pores. i highly recommend it ",positive
" this product blended well into my skin and i forget that i was wearing makeup. what is amazing about avon is that their products are very economical and yet is of very high quality. i am usually acne-prone so i am careful about what i use on my face. it is not oily and yet even dry skins can use it. it is very matte and can be worn alone ",positive
" this stuff smells awesome. i have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy. i haven't used it yet because i love the smell so much and i don't want it to go away. i just ordered a bunch though so i will try it out. they are really pretty too. if i was a kid and didn't know any better i would probably try to eat it ",positive
" if you love baths but simply must have bubbles then the bubble bars can be a lovely addition to a salt soak. you can also add one of these or half of a bubble bar along with one of the bath bombs. i keep buying the bath bombs and giving them away as gifts which is an excuse to buy more lush products! i've tried numerous bubble bath products and these seem to produce an especially fun amount of bubbles. you can literally hide below the bubbles there are so many. you also get the added benefit of more essential oils. with lush products you may have to get a journal just for bath bliss experiences. there are certain products you can blend together to create moods and moments. ~the rebecca revie ",positive
" this is my favourite lush bubble bar. it makes lots of bubbles and is good for 2 very decadent baths. it can be divided into 3 or even 4 baths but i like lots of bubbles so i usually divide into 2 baths. it smells like vanilla candy and is wonderful. the smell usually lingers a lot longer in the bathroom than it does on me. i have a dark blue tub so can't really see if the water changes colour. i think if it does it can only be a faint pink. it has a strong smell but i think that's part of why i love it so much. the candy flower on top can be pink blue yellow or white. if you like this i would also recommend you try melting marshmallow moment which is a bath melt (ie no bubbles) but it's also really yummy and a lot more skin-softening. this can also be divided into at least 2 baths and still be indulgent ",positive
" covers great (i have read splotches) and is good for my skin. cannot recommend it highly enough ",positive
" this powder provides excellent coverage without being thick. (thick powder base is horrible - it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour.) my freckles are still there but my skintone is more even. it did its job of concealer very well - no red spots no dark circles - and it works very well as a foundation/powder. much better than any other powder foundation i've ever used. come to think of it much better than any liquid foundation i've ever used ",positive
" china glaze is my favorite polish but perhaps it's because they are the only ones i've ever seen with this color #86 your touch. it's so gorgeous i've had compliments on it nearly every place i go. china glaze seems to have limited retail distribution so i've had to order it online for years - and this vendor was perhaps the best ever in sending it out so quickly! great job ",positive
" i bought this because i wanted a primer for make up but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out as some reviews have stated. initially i did break out a little but i kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth. after a week the breakouts went away (they were minor) and all i can say is wow. my skin looks so much better my make up looks better i look better without make up etc. etc. i use it with complete me powder foundation and i have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products. ",positive
" i love this stuff! i have my mother's hands as my sister calls them. as the years go by they're getting more and more wrinkly and i also have age spots. i gave some to my sister last year and now she's got me buying it too! this hand cream makes my hands smooth and silky feeling without being greasy. it's also improved the condition of my cuticles in only a few applications. i'd highly recommend it to anyone who has dry hands and cuticles. you'll love it too ",positive
" seriously. at first i thought it may be too harsh (this from someone who has skin that can take a beating!) but after awhile i found it not harsh enough! what i do now is apply it to dry skin for a more intense scrub -- trust me this stuff truly is wonderful ",positive
" i am highly sceptical myself when it comes to skincare products. i received this as a gift after trying the mask of magnaminty (also good). i was blown away by how this product made my skin feel. i have used every product under the sun and am a regular proactiv customer. this scrub was great for my oily skin and left it feeling really clean and soft. i am totally hooked! you will love it too...totally worth the money ",positive
" the best thing about this product is that there is a numbing agent. apply and leave on the skin for about 20-30 seconds and then your skin begins to numb slightly then you start shaving. it's great because you don't feel the razor on the skin as much; which makes shaving quite pleasant. i've searched for other shaving cream on the market with this numbing feature and the closest is anthony logistics which i don't think as nice as philosophy common man. a little goes a long way when you shave and so the tube lasts quite long. i would buy this again... ",positive
" i received this product as a x-mas gift this year. i really do like it considering the last two philosophy products i did not care for (the gingerbread man bodywash and amen cologne). out of the tube it's a little thick but you only need a thin layer to do the trick. it offers up a nice smooth shave and my skin feels soft and moisturized afterward. definitely a keeper.. ",positive
" this is my favorite mascara in the world. i've tried many brands and nothing compares! i'm sold ",positive
" i've never liked my lashes until i put this on. what a difference ",positive
" this stuff is fantastic1 it smells and looks like mint chocolate chip icecream (too bad it doesn't taste like it). it cools and sooths the skin while exfoliateing away the dead skin. i keep mine in the fridge as an extra cool treat ",positive
" made my skin smooth and very clean. i loved the minty smell. will definitely buy it agai ",positive
" when you buy this perfume for your girlfriend don't tell her it was under 40 dollars! i don't know why people make a big deal over expensive perfume. yeah like it really smells better just because it's more expensive. anyway sarah jessica parker perfume has a really nice scent that you'll want to smell over and over. it's nice that you don't have to spend a lot of money on it either. add just a touch for proper use ",positive
" i love this scent. it makes me feel good! it is light but sexy. it is not overpowering in any way so i even wear it to work. i spray it on every morning to start the day off feeling good. they say that scents can affect your mood - well this one in particular really makes me feel great ",positive
" i love this perfume. it's subtle and elegant and just beautiful ",positive
" is there anyone that doesn't know sarah jessica parker? great perfume. very nice smell ",positive
" this fragrance starts off fine but the longer you wear the better it gets and that very nice smell lasts a wonderfully long time!! ",positive
" i got the gift box. i love it. it smells very modern and you can layer it with a sugar or a vanilla to make your own blend. it smells money - because it is so sophisticated - i love how it wears it gets nicer as the evening goes on. i like that in a scent. ",positive
" once again spending a little more money for a product that does what it advertises is worth it. this is the only toner i have ever used that completely diminishes oil and shininess without over-drying my skin. i alternate with #3 depending on the weather ",positive
" if you're like me and your scalp itches like crazy after you get your color done nioxin system scalp therapy is the answer. (the numbers only represent the type of hair you have use a lower number if your hair is more fine.) use this once or two times after color and the scalp itch goes away. the product claims to help thinning hair. i have no issue with that and i think i found an off-market use for the product but it works for me so i'll take it ",positive
" this is a really fun gift for children (although you might have guessed that i like them too) it has a sweet fruity scent without being a sugar buzz and the colors are very bright and cheerful. i would suggest one of those wire or slotted soap dishes to help these dry easier and faster though. a regular soap dish without any type of draining makes it melt faster ",positive
" whenever i saw glass or porcelain nail files in stores i always thought they were overpriced you can get all kinds of nail files for a couple of bucks and i didn't see a reason to pay more. but i was given one of these and now i think it's worth it. it is a really strong file so strong that my mother was startled by how much it took off the first time she used it. you really only need very gentle pressure and speed with this type of file. it is very easy too clean and shows no signs of wear by this time i usually would have killed a normal file ",positive
" these are good and do the trick but it's hard to get my fingers in the holes. ",positive
" this mascara goes on like a dream and stays put throughout the day without tearing or irritation. your lashes will look like they belong in an advertisement ",positive
" i wasn't crazy about this mascara when i first put it on but it grew on me. the brush is not a regular mascara brush and it took a little getting used to however i love it now. it brushes the clumps right off your lashes as you apply. they'll be long and nicely separated. and the stuff stays on your lashes like glue all day. no smearing and it still looks perfect at the end of the day to the point where i feel like it's a shame to wash my eye makeup off. i'm really pleased with it. i want to try lancome's new mascara too but this one is definitely a keeper. ",positive
" mistral as many know is a powerful gusty wind that blows across the south of france. mistral as i was happy to discover is also the name of a line of bath and body products all french inspired all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. matthew tilker founder and president of mistral utilizes shea butter which is an efficacious natural healer in a myriad of must-have forms. derived from the nuts of the african shea tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women) this butter is highly emollient a boon for those with dry skin chapped lips any number of skin irritations. the pure shea butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). south seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming soothing as a tropical island. the marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit white flowers and soft woods. an irresistible combination. south seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel body lotion massage bath and body oil bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices. - gail cooke ",positive
" the pores of the face become clogged with makeup cremes sunscreens bronzing gels powders etc. exfoliation washing facials steaming do not remove blackheads whiteheads and clogged pores. this simple product gets them out! buying one will last a life time. no need to buy another ever.... the ultimate cleaning device.... ",positive
" bobbi brown makes excellent lip colors. they are very smooth and have some staying power ",positive
" this smells so wonderful! wear it and you will get compliments. it seems like it might be a summertime-only scent (i.e. very tropical) but i'd wear it year round. i only wish they made a larger size in the oil.. ",positive
" what i like most about these vitamins is that they are very small and easy to swallow unlike a lot of other hair and nail vitamins which are huge. i am not sure if i notice a difference in the condition of my hair but i will continue to purchase and use the vitamins nevertheless ",positive
" i took this supplement for 6 months and i noticed a dramatic change in hair appearance length and my nails!! i would like to keep taking it but i can't afford it for a while which i am really bummed out about it. i definitely recommend this product. it also has a huge celebrity following and now i know why ",positive
" i have started taking this supplement a month ago and i feel my hair is stronger than ever. also my hair loss has became minimal! besides that my nails are harder i love it ",positive
" i have the beginnings of crow's feet. the essential c eye cream has helped to decrease the lines and restored the elasticity and suppleness of the delicate skin around my eyes ",positive
" i can't say enough good about this lipstick. i am a black woman with a light-skinned golden brown complexion like halle berry. when i received the malibu peach my first impression was that it was too light and that my lips were going to look ashy. however when applied it is the perfect smooth sheer soft peach color. it's a very rich product and the case is elegant. it doesn't have that funky smell or taste that a lot of lip products do and it's not sticky!! i love mac but if my hair blows into my face it sticks to my lips (eww). big ups to mally! (thumbs that is..lol) i will definitely be trying some other mally products. i also ordered the brow kit in sable which is first rate ",positive
" i have used philosophy products for over a year now and am a proponent of their exfoliators and cleansers. i enthusiastically bought the present after seeing it as a new product at the nordstrom counter. the bottle says that it is clear makeup for fine lines wrinkles and uneven texture. it can be used three different ways; alone as an oil-free moisturizer for sensitive skin; over oil free moisturizer (such as hope in a jar) to create the illusion of airbrushed skin; and under foundation for a smooth finish. i was after that airbrushed skin and this product works great if used over moisturizer. it truly does minimize pores and fine lines. if you don't like to wear a lot of makeup it gives you a very fresh and natural look. unfortunately no matter how diligent your are sometimes blemishes pop up and you have to use foundation. the present was not suitable in this function for me. used under my foundation my makeup felt cakey thick and the foundation did not blend well into this product. it left unsightly foundation streaks that were difficult to correct. i could not hold my mac foundation responsible because used alone it does not exhibit any of these qualities. i would highly reccomend this product as clear makeup but not as a foundation primer as indicated on the back of the bottle. if you are looking for a foundation primer i would reccomend smashbox's photo finish. it is extremely lightweight blends well with foundation and the bottle will last forever because you use such small amounts. ",positive
" i was given this product as a gift and i just love it. i'll often wear it on weekends without any additional makeup. it smoothes this skin surface. true - the coverage is not the same as with a tinted foundation - but it offers a lot of improvement worn alone. also i was using a tinted cream makeup base that was not working well on my dry skin. it would create lines etc. so i started combining the two things - the tinted cream base and the philosophy skin perfector together on a sponge before applying and bingo - this solved the problem. so if you want a tint plus the smoothness you might want to give this a try. ",positive
" i have been using this powder for about 5 years. it is amazing. i have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. once i put on my concealer and foundation i put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. it even comes with the perfect application brush. this powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do ",positive
" great towel for the gym or after swimming. very absorbant and i also use one to cover the circuit machines when i use them ",positive
" i first tried amazing grace a couple of years ago. at that time i had a dresser full of department store colognes. the scent of amazing grace is somehow undescribable. suffice it to say it is the perfect fragrance and those other scents are history. it is pleasing to the person who wears it and is pleasing to someone just walking by you. some perfumes walk into a room before the person does or is so strong it makes other people's eyes water. we've all been around someone like that. not so with amazing grace. it is just in harmony with you and those around you ",positive
" i hardly ever wore a fragrance until i received amazing grace as a christmas present. i love it. it is clean and sensual. whoever says this smells like a granny must have a strange sense of smell. there's nothing granny about it. it is never overpowering ",positive
" i totally disagree with the reviewers that say it smells strong and like a granny! i don't know what they're smelling but obviously it's not this. it does smell a little stronger at first than it does when the fragrance has settled in but it certainly doesn't smell like any granny i've ever smelled. i always get compliments when i wear this fragrance (which is every day)- complete strangers will come up to me and tell me how good i smell. i recommend starting with the body emulsion and then lightly spritzing the fragrance (1 spray should do the trick). ",positive
" a spearmint top note a lemon middle and a clean bottom. patrick wore this (yes it's great on manly men too) when we ran a half marathon last week and my nose followed him all the way to the finish line. a truly unusual and pleasurable scent. it's green but not in the obvious chypre leafy modern sense like chanel's crystalle. nope this is mint like julep. i've never been the biggest guerlain fan--i've left the shalimar-isms to my grandmother who is ravissante in those old fashioned orientals...but guerlain's splendid aqua allegoria line--which includes herba fresca and the equally divine pamplelune (a grapefruit and chamomile burst) among others--is truly fresh. i get lots of compliments when i wear herba fresca ",positive
" i am a bonafide lush junkie and this stuff is what makes me so. smells great works wonders and for $22 dollars of high end shampoo you couldn't get a better deal. this stuff will last me 4 months at least ",positive
" smells great! not too harsh on my thin but long hair ",positive
" ever notice how many good things are juicy? juicy steaks. nothing tastes better even though the price can be outrageous. juicy gossip. really you can tell me; i never ever repeat what i'm told! ah and then there's the fresh frisky fruity i love juicy shampoo from lush! this is a thick rich jelly shampoo that absolutely whisks away city dirt or country soil with a dollop and one shampoo. infused with mango pineapple kiwi and papaya it not only leaves hair squeaky clean but also smelling divine with an appealing fruity scent. give those perfumed shampoos to a rival (she'll be stunned when you're nice to her) and go for the fresh! let me know how much you love juicy. oh and if you've heard something juicy - send it along. remember i won't tell a soul! ",positive
" even better than i expected! light fresh scent that is not overly sweet ",positive
" if you have dry skin on your feet these socks are fantastic. i place mine in the microwave for 15 seconds while i apply moisturizer to my feet. slide the socks onto your feet as soon as the microwave is finished. in 15 minutes you have a quick but effective moisturizing treatment. if your feet are really dry you could do the same thing but leave them on overnight. i found the overnight option to be a little warm on my feet. but it might work fine for you. these socks are 94% cotton and 6% spandex. they can be machine washed and tumbled dried. i have not found it necessary launder them each time i use them. i use a light moisturizer (kerasal) so you might have a different experience if you use a heavier product to moisturize. i would highly recommend this product. ",positive
" i have frosted hair that is generally on the dry side. the problem with most conditioners i've tried is that if they are good enough to get out the knots in my hair and soften it they are very heavy and weigh my hair down. i found out about kerastase at my beauty parlor and can only get it there or at amazon. it's wonderful doing everything i need including making my hair nice and shiny without the heaviness. i recommend it highly ",positive
" expensive but a small amount makes a big difference. excellent conditioner for dry thick hair. also very pleasing fragrance. the best hair treatment i've found for my straight coarse dry hair. highly recommended ",positive
" this stuff is amazing. i use candle light underneath my eyes and around my brows. it makes my eyes look picture perfect all day long. it's especially beautiful in sunlight - really makes my blue eyes pop! ",positive
" i've suffered most of my life from the dark circle syndrome. it's become much worse at nearly 35 years old with four kids! a dear friend in the industry (my personal guru!) recommended this. it is nothing short of amazing! i wear it with just a tinted face lotion (foundation makes our wrinkles stand out as i now know) and once in a while a quick dust of bare minerals clear mineral veil. my husband commented (in only two days which is a record for him) that i must have slept well because my face looked so good. this stuff is soooo worth the price. i'll never be without it again! ",positive
" i am very glad with my purchase. it gives a subtle natural glow to skin not a tacky shiny one. i am usually not very comfortable with wearing foundation and i prefer tinted moisturizers. happy light gives even complexion without being heavy. it also offers sun protection spf 15. if you don't need more than medium coverage it is worth considering this brand. ",positive
" i've been wearing philosophy's falling in love as a regular fragrance and liked it so much that i decided to give some of their other products a try... pure grace has been a lovely find! i spray a little on a blouse or jacket and have that lovely fresh-washed scent lingering all day. it compliments the falling in love scent nicely as both are fairly light but i love it on its own as a nice change of pace as well. so far it has been just as advertised-- clean soapy and crisp-- and i'd add that it's just one of the most comforting smells around... makes me want to curl up in a pile of warm towels fresh from the dryer and take a little nap ",positive
" i have been searching for what seems like forever for a nice cologne or perfume that is not all flowery and overpowering. now i have finally found it! i love this scent! it just smells so clean and fresh. i'm so glad i tried it! the first couple times i wore it i received compliments and questions about what was i wearing. that never happened to me before. so i went and purchased the lotion and shower cream too. the only bad thing about it is that like many others have said the smell doesn't last too long and so i keep reapplying it. maybe now that i have the lotion too the smell will last longer. i would highly recommend trying this fragrance. i think you will love it ",positive
" the charcoal in this soap acts as a sort of rasp for exfoliating dead skin cells. the licorice extract soothes and rehydrates. this is a very good soap if you have minor break-outs or oily skin. if you are very sensitive you might want to try fresh farmacy instead (it has calamine lotion.) ",positive
" wowzers! i am a 26 year old male with skin from the devil. it's so oily that only two minutes out of the shower my nose is already greasy. i have been using fresh farmacy 1x or 2x daily for the past two months or so and have been thouroughly impressed. a week ago i bought a bar of coalface out of curiosity. i had read about it on the lush website and was somewhat skeptical. i was told at the store that fresh farmacy would be the better bet for my kind of skin and i figured the slightly higher pricetag on the ff meant that it was better than coalface. now having used coalface for the past week i can say for sure that my skin feels cleaner and tighter with coalface than it generally has with ff. i'm not about to toss out my remaining ff of course! it lasts forever and i probably have another 6 or 7 months of it left. i find it to be a great skin cleanser. so far though i think coalface is the better choice for me. give this stuff a try ",positive
" i recieved a sample of this bar with a large shipment of lush products i ordered around christmas i gave most of the products as gifts so i full enjoyed the samples no matter how freaky they sounded i loved this bar it smelled clean and was fun to use and even though i have combination skin that usually is dry that time of year i did not notice any drying out and it cleared all problem areas up especially black heads! i strongly recomend this bar for any one with any problem areas. i wish i could talk more of my friends into using lush products because their simply is the perfect miracle product for everyone to be found among them. and how fabulous are those bath products simply heaven ",positive
" i love auqolinas first and ground breaking perfume pink sugar to death but it is such an overpowering scent that i am often smelled before i am seen and perhaps such a strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate. aquolinas new perfume chocolovers is similarly sweet but much subtler. if you love the sweet scent of pink sugar but don't like how you can be smelled from 12 feet away try chocolovers ",positive
" i bought this mostly because of how obsessed i am with pink sugar. this product smells sweet. it smells like you rubbed yourself with a box of truffles before you left the house. i personally think of this as a good thing- i love candy/food scents. my perfume collection is such that i am suprised i'm not followed everywhere i go by a swarm of bees. if you're looking for a sophisticated scent please don't buy this or pink sugar. if you are looking to have people ask hey do you smell a delicious cake? everytime you walk past...buy away. and who doesn't want to smell like a delicious cake? ",positive
" 'don't know what these others are talking about. chocolovers smells yummy! what's great about this fragrance is that it's not overwhelming and it's not going to make you smell like dessert. it's got chocolatey tones but it's not just about chocolate; it's warm and musky with orange oil hazlenut vanilla... if in doubt you can always go to sephora and try a sample first (see sephora.com for store locations) ",positive

" this light refreshing fragrance is a classic and you'll use it every day. the simplicity of this cologne gives it a style all its own ",positive
" this is really good smelling cologne. i hardly use it anymore though because of its current popularity. gio may be the most popular cologne out there. i would much rather be original than one of the herd. you'll have to make the decision yourself be original or smell like everyone else ",positive
" giorgio armani is know for his excellence and fineness when it comes to his clothing accessories bags and of course: fragrances. acqua di gio is remarkable distinguished and flawless in every sense. it has been the best-selling cologne since its release and has become synonymous with sexy. 99% of people (men and women) who come in contact with you on the daily basis will compliment you on your smell (at least in my case.) i'm not complimented on any cologne i own more than this one so i usually wear it when i know i'll be in contact with more than a few people. this fragrance is truly awe-inspiring and it proves once again that when it comes to delicate scents armani is king ",positive
" i use to be a huge calvin klien fan until i came across this product. i've been wearing it since 2000 and have not been without it since. the ladies love the scent which is obvious as i've had women come up and sniff me in public (yes public and then be excused when asking me what brand of cologone i have on). forget bout those axe and tag promo's in the real world this is the stuff that get you remembered not just noticed.

" this mascara goes on beautifully and looks great but it's messy. it's more liquid than most mascaras and when i travel with it the tube leaks! it also tends to smear when i first put it on but after it dries it's good for the day. if you carry mascara with you or travel often look for another brand ",positive
" i've used this cream for years. i like the way it feels and makes my skin look. i'd recommend it to anyone. ",positive
" i'm always skeptical of age defying products but this one really works. i've been using it since it first came out (maybe 10 years?) and people often think i'm younger than i am (27). i'm not really using it for that though - i use it because it is unreal how good it is with acne. it prevents breakouts and also heals current pimples so fast. when i run out the breakouts are back ",positive

" wow! my husband and i both use this scrub. it is very refreshing. the salt scrub is easy to apply and leaves a nice minty smell in the shower and on the skin for at least an hour! like the previous review i feel the chill after getting out of the shower...then i was full of energy! i look forward to trying this one after a hot work out or yard work! this will be a staple in our household!

" i recieved this as a gift and have always loved other products by philosophy. this is great for a hot sticky day and you want to jump in the shower exfoliate and cool off. the first time i used it i have to admit i was freezing after my shower! it has a very strong cooling effect that lasts on the skin for at least an hour. the smell is very natural not artificial like a few other of philosophy's 3in1. it's a combo of mint and wintergreen.. i would compare it to their candy cane scent. i've been using it reguarly after workouts & it's great!! a nice cool down ",positive
" murad's skin perfecting lotion is the best product on the market. i have oily skin and this is a light moisturizer. it didn't clog my pores or cause any breakouts. its great to use in the morning and evening ",positive
" not as much coverage as i would like for my mildly ruddy complexion but it definitely smoothes out skin texture and moisturizes very well. ",positive
" i recently realized that while my wife spends hundreds on high quality skin care products for us i was still using throw away razors. i recently received a fusion razor and loved that until i went to replace the blades. $4+ a piece and they last no longer than any other blade. so i got online and researched shaving and what i learned was that though there have been advances in shaving technology nothing has been improved only made more expensive. i learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor a decent brush shaving soap and a mug. i received my razor a couple of days ago and now i wake up eager to take a shower and shave. nothing has ever cut this close without giving me razor burn. my skin is sensitive and i have had no problems with that since getting this amazing razor. it was worth the price too because it is the same cost as 4 sets of fusion replacements. the replacement blades for this razor are fifty cents a piece and do a far better job. i have read reviews for this razor by people who apparently weren't trained to shave. this razor will not cut against the grain. also the handle is weighted so you have to allow the razor to do all the work or you run the real risk of filleting your face. be patient. a great shave takes a little more commitment than just breaking out a can of foam and a disposable razor. let the razor do the work. i assure you even if it takes a few days to get the technique down you will be thrilled with this razor. the nicest feature of this amazing razor is that it allows you to adjust the closeness of the blade. i learned that most people like it between one and one and a half. mine is set at one and a half and it gives me a perfect shave every time. until now i didn't know that such a thing was even possible. happy shaving ",positive
" the quality and workmanship is top notch! the price is high for a razor but it will take you less than a year to break even if you are buying cartriges like the gillette fusion at $4 a pop! and it will last you a lifetime. replacement blades for the razor run about 50 cents each and last a hole lot longer! i was only getting 4-5 shaves from a fusion blade but i can shave my face and head for at least 2-3 weeks on a single safey razor blade :) even if i changed the blade after every shave it would still cost less than a fusion. it takes some getting used to. i got a few minor nicks when i first started using it but now i never get any. i even shave my head with it :) i've had mine for about 6 months and love it. i suggest starting out on the #1 setting and work your way up. for me right between 1 and 2 is best any higher and the shave is too close.

" the strawberry milkshake shower gel smells just like bonomo turkish candy i bought when i was a kid. i like it but i think the shower gel is overrated due to exposure on qvc. other shower gels are creamier than this. i'll enjoy using this and the eggnog then go back to making my own ",positive
" this is one of my favorites. i love the scent. it doesn't smell like fresh strawberries because it's not supposed to. it's supposed to smell like a strawberry milkshake (and i think they did a good job of it - so this is what i expected). philosophy does a good job of matching the scent to the name. the only thing i didn't expect was that i still need to condition with another conditioner. i'd say it's a shampoo and shower gel a 2-in-1 not a 3-in-1 ",positive
" like i stated in the title this isn't my favorite three-in-one product from philosophy. i have several of their scents and i really love cinnamon buns and some of the chocolatey ones. strawberry milkshake smells nice but it is very sweet. i wouldn't say it smells artifical but it doesn't smell like fresh strawberries either. i have used it as a shampoo/conditioner quite often and i have no issues with it. i have fine hair and it didn't leave me with tangles like some of the other reviewers have complained about. ",positive
" works exceptionally well. dont use water just place 10-15 drops into bowl and like a tea candle. creates warm and relaxing aromas ",positive
" when i tried this on it washed make-up and pores nicely but after i washed my face my skin felt so rubbery and a little too dry maybe because i didn`t get the right skin soap for it but when i tried other ones it still had the same effect ",positive
" i find these soaps to be very good. there are actually 4 different kinds i believe one also for sensitive skin. if someone felt a none clean feeling afterwardsperhaps they are not taking their makeup off with the proper product or they are using the wrong soap for their skin type. this soap is similiar to dhc soaps from japan. if they are to drying try using the correct soap. for help i would suggest going to the clinque counter or ask me. ",positive
" everything is fine except i was a bit irritated by shedding...it leaves bristles on my face and they get into the razor. i hope it will pass with time as other reviewers reported. foaming action is very good and badger bristle is much more pleasent to the touch than boar. i'll report again on this item in few months ",positive
" i too am very pleased with this brush. my previous brush had a ceramic handle that cracked. this wood handle seems built to last. the badger bristles are excellent. i paid $10...unusually low price for a quality shave brush ",positive
" this shaving brush is perhaps the most inexpensive way to get a pure badger bristle shaving brush. i've now been using it for a year and a half and it has not shed any real amount of its bristles like the cheaper brushes on the market. the brush head remains densely packed and quite soft. hopefully it will remain that way for some time to come. in the meantime i do enjoy the close and comfortable shaves that are aided by this brush. because of it i have sworn off of canned shave gels for every situation except travel. they just can't compare to your average $1.50 cake of shaving soap and this brush. this was a very worthwhile purchase for me ",positive
" if memory serves noted designer giorgio armani was once quoted as saying that his designs were created not to be noticed but rather to be remembered. a wonderful thought typifying his always elegant classic style. it's certainly true of his latest fragrance for men - black code. this is a subtle sensual scent with a touch of the oriental found in notes of lemon and bergamot. it's an ultra masculine fragrance difficult to capture yet impossible to ignore. true to armani's vision the glass bottle is artfully crafted - a cylinder of the deepest blue. it's gift boxed in the same color with printing in gray and white. available in 1.7 and 2.5 oz. sprays black code is sure to take its place by the side of armani's always popular gio and mania.

" after buying some lush products from here i went into the lush store in pasadena where the staff was awesome and totally helpful. after explaining my horrendous hair issues they gave me some samples of rehab retread and big and i bought a bottle of american dream. they all work wonderfully. rehab made my scalp tingly and my hair felt so soft. my hair has literally never felt better. i highly recommend rehab or any lush products for that matter ",positive
" one sudsy washing of your hair seems enough but you may be tempted to wash your hair again. the suds in the lush products are especially sensuous and fun. baths and showers have never been as fun as when you use these products. lush shampoos and conditioners are above a salon quality and also contain natural ingredients and scents that are beyond deluscious. this shampoo goes a long way so you can use a lot less. this shampoo contains seaweed enzymes for cleaning and essential oils to detoxify your scalp. this product also contains a lovely helping of pineapple kiwi and mango juice. the peppermint rose lavender almond rosemary olive and jojoba oil are especially healing. if there is a more perfect shampoo i haven't found it. this shampoo is a true dream and contains everything you want for deep cleansing and scalp refreshing. for softly scented and highly conditioned locks use this conditioning shampoo and finish off with the american cream. the entire bathroom will be scented and the fragrance will drift through the house. you will awake the next morning and your hair will still be wonderfully scented with egyptian musk honey water vanilla sage and lavender. the conditioner also contains fresh strawberries. also in love with: sex bomb bath ballistic candy cane bubble bath bar ambrosia shave cream ~the rebecca review p.s. the smallest size bottle is perfect for travel! ",positive
" i have dry unmanagable curly hair and rehab has done wonders for it! because all the lush shampoos don't contain any silicones it takes about one or two weeks for your hair to get used to it. the squeeky feeling described in the other review is because of the lack of silicones this feeling disappears however when your hair dries up. since i use rehab my hair is bouncy soft and shiny. especially great in combination with american cream conditoner (just love that scent!

" this is the way to beat the airline travel restrictions for carrying liquids. actually i liked everything about this product. certainly easy to use and certainly pleased with the performance. no more mini bottles of shampoo for me ",positive
" for some reason chicks dig this aroma. i've tried many clognes over many years but this gets the best reaction. i'm getting more now at the request of several ladies so i decided to write this review. with my luck they'll stop making the stuff now so i'm buying 5 bottles just in case ",positive
" this is a really great smelling colonge. really fragrent but not in your face strong. i love to where this cologne before i go and do something really fun. like going on a date or hanging with the guys cause i really think that this colonge is lucky. there are plenty of times i was doing something mischevious and i swear i didn't get caught cause i was lucky :) get it? i smells good and it is just like a rabbit foot with luck pick some up!!!! ",positive
" this is a great mascara it doesn't get clumpy but it leaves your lashes fuller longer and it lasts without flaking or smudging. well worth the price which is surprisingly lower than most other department store brands ",positive
" i received a sample of this mascara (in black) and just love it. it's perfect for everyday wear as it's not too dramatic and is very long lasting. in fact it's so long lasting that i even took a nap while wearing it and it didn't smudge at all. i was pleased to find however that it came off very easily with my clinque rinse-off foaming cleanser so there was no need for a separate eye-make-up remover. i have more expensive mascaras than this and they are not as good. definitely a great product ",positive
" i really like using this product. the color powder is very sheer and the shimmer powder adds just a subtle amount of sparkle. i like using this after i have applied a light amount of foundation in place of a powder which normally makes my face look older. the shimmer powder doesn't cake like ordinary powders do and gives my face a fresh look. ",positive
" put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling. your dark circles will be concealed and you'll look wide awake ",positive
" well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag ",positive
" awesome product - best concealer i've ever used. it is lightweight and does not settle into the under eye creases that my almost 50-year-old eyes have. the pink undertone brightens and lightens. ",positive
" this lip gloss is great. not only does it taste great the initial stickiness goes away after a few moments and stays on longer than most other glosses. definitely a must have for anyone's make-up bag ",positive
" i love lemon curd so i was quite happy to discover philosophy's frozen lemon custard lip shine. the consistency is quite thick and coats the lips well. this is by far my favorite lip shine scent ",positive
" yum! fond childhood memories and sweet almost guilty pleasure is created whenever i use this. it smells wonderful. deliciously scented bubbles blossom on my mesh sponge. this shower gel cleans well without being harsh to sensitive skin. i don't like it as a shampoo as much. when i do use it to wash my hair i'm sure to follow up with a conditioner. it's a delightful product and i'm pleased with my purchase ",positive
" this stuff smell delicious..who can resist? i love it !! smells like chocolate mint to me...love i ",positive
" unless you have super oily skin and cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions you shouldn't use this. i have oily/normal skin and find that even this dry lotion is moisturizing enough for me. it is definitely not for dry skins and or sensitive types. kinerase products are touted for their ultra sensitive ingredients but beware this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which can in fact irritate your skin. though this does seem to deliver some skin smoothing it is not in my opinion as good as the cream version which is much better at balancing skin and does not contain the retinyl palmitate. both are good but kinerase cream is better ",positive
" ok here's the deal. i hate chemicals. i am a health nut. i hate greasy moisturizers. i love to get the most out of everything i do... you know that ny or 90's philosophy of multi-tasking or why do 1 thing when you can do 2? the solution is kinerase... realtively chemically good... if it wipes off on the baby when we hug it's no biggy. i think the worst thing in it is methylparaben... which is in everything even baby products so whatever... and i can moisturize while i get a serious healthy skin glow on my face that does not quit! i think it's made for wrinkles but i am not worrying about that yet so i use it for the clear skin glow thing that i have always wanted... the skin of my dreams! i barely use skin makeup anymore because my once icky skin (that's a clinical term) has been literally transformed! buy! buy! buy! i kid you not... it's worth every penny.

" i have been using this product for over a year. only took a couple of weeks to improve the very thin skin under my eyes. a little goes a long long way. one jar lasted me about 4 months using every day. this product blends into the skin quickly and i use it under make-up. it calms my skin. i am happy about this product ",positive

" what a brilliant package! it's a squeezebottle with a brush at the end and has a twist on lid. no spills no mess no disaster. love it! it is easy to apply with the brush. i have lava flow which is a shimmery pink. the shimmer is a more obvious than i would like as it's big flecks of sparkle but it isn't so bad that it looks like glitter glue. there is a strong smell and taste sorta tropical; although it isn't unpleasant it is powerful. kinda reminds me of red koolaid. the color is a bright pink when first applied but simmers down to a medium pink and is rather sheer. in the container the color looks unwearable but in reality it isn't dramatic. the only drawback is how sticky it feels. it is less sticky than mac's lipglass but more so than urban decay xxx if that makes sense. i got this as a freebie and i'm glad i got to try it. i would buy it but in a different color ",positive
" i'm not a makeup or product junkie by any means but simply can't miss even one day of using my all about lips. it is a cream (much like a moisturizer) that exfoliates and smoothes your lips and makes them fuller/plumper. it also fills in any lines you may have around the mouth so i recommend using it not only on your lips but also outside the lipline. although i have been using it twice daily for many years i believe someone using it for the first time should see results fairly quickly. friends of mine who wear lipstick (i don't) also claim if they use it right before they put on lipstick it makes it go on better and last longer. (apparently you can also use this product as an eye cream to smooth crowsfeet around the eyes but i havent tried this- i prefer caudelie eye serum and cream.) simply put i highly recommend this product and know you'll see results as i have! ",positive
" i have used hundreds of kinds of smoothers and conditioners on my thick color-treated hair (it is poofy and rough without any help!) and this stuff did the trick to make is smooth lay down and be soft in one treatment!!!!!!!!!!!! buy this stuff if your hair is coarse and poofy and spilt/damaged! you need this stuff. it smells good is easy to use (and just use a tiny bit!) and works ",positive
" first of all it seems a bit silly to defend the smell of any product as everyone has different oppinions on this. i happen to love the smell but i am writing this review to talk about what this product actually does; which is transforms hair. i have naturally curly hair and awhile back i chopped it all off on a hairdresser's suggestion. when my hair was an inch long it wasn't hard to fight my hair type. now that i'm in the process of growing it out my hair has been pretty annoyed at the contant blow drying dying and straightening i have subjected it to. regardless of the cut my hair has been limp and fried. after using this product along with big shampoo my hair has been absolutely transformed. people have commented on my hair ever since i have started using these wonderful products. now to the issue of price: before using lush i was using bumble and bumble wich goes for 20 bucks a pop as well as various styling products that ran in the similar price range... since using lush i have no need for styling products therefore making these purchases very economical. i can't say enough great things about this brand ",positive
" now let's get its effectiveness out of the way so we can talk about that love it or hate it scent! it is a really thick conditioner and works great every other day or every few days. i have really long hair and this tames it and smoothes my split ends and it leaves my hair shiny. it isn't greasy at all. if you are used to drugstore or salon conditioners don't judge the effectiveness of any natural conditioner for a month. that is how long it can take for the silicones in mainstream conditioners to leave your hair (silicones are all those things in conditioner that end in cone like dimethicone etc). detoxing your hair off silicones is well worth it though my hair is much healthier and shinier without that buildup. so the scent: it is green kind of melon and fresh with a hint of violet (like bathos gratuitous violets and daddyo) to it. it took some getting used to and when i first got it i thought it smelled of green beans or some vegetable-like smell. but when you use it and rinse it out you are left with a rich green scent with the tiniest hint of gently floral violet. it isn't for everybody but if you buy it give it a chance to work its magic in your hair before you make your judgement because that lovely violetty smell combined with how well it works makes it kind of addictive. i use it with daddyo shampoo to enhance that hint of violet and the fresh green scent i get from it. i use it in rotation with american cream which is a bit lighter ",positive
" earlier on i had read all the reviews for retread. paying 20 bucks for a conditioner did not quite suit me. however i have been using it for a month now and i have to say that the reviews were an inadequate discription of the product. personally i believe this to be an amazing product. i used it in combination with big and i believe my hair has never looked better. retread is a superb conditioner and really does wonders. i have virgin hair but i do blow dry it ever day so i felt a heavier conditioner was necessary. since this is a deeper conditioner i would leave it in for 5-10 min or while you do all your other stuff in the shower/bath. my hair was softer than ever afterwards (that could be from big though) and shined like the sun. this is not an everyday conditioner but works well for once or twice a week (i mainly use it for special occasions or when i just want to feel pretty!) i highly recommend it and i feel that it works much better than lush's conditioning treatments. the only issue was the smell. i am not much into the smell of cucumbers and to me that is what it smelled like. however this could just be a personal attribute as no one else has mentioned this. the product was still amazing though and i am willing to endure the smell(it fades as the day goes on). my decision about this product is miracle! hope this helps! ",positive
" i just bought retread hair conditioner today from my local lush store and tried it tonight. my hair was a-m-a-z-i-n-g after i used it. after i've read all the reviews about the product i was still a little skepticle as i've tried many things that had awesome reviews but just didn't work with my thick coarse hair. i shampooed my hair put in retread hair conditioner covered my hair with a plastic cap and set a hot towel over it for an hour (dunking the towel in hot water every 15 minutes to 'reheat' it). rinsed out the conditioner and didn't use anything else on my hair (i usually have to put in anti-frizz serum). the first thing i noticed was the shine... what a huge difference. even my boyfriend said there was something different but he couldn't quite figure it out. retread hair conditioner left my hair super soft too. and you don't even need to use that much. now for the bad.... the smell (that's why it's not 5 stars)! i know some people say they love it and some people say they hate it and i really think that's the way it is... you either hate it or love it. i actully hated it. my boyfriend took one whiff (and thought it smelled like old soggy towels) and offered to drive me back to lush to return it because he thought it was 'old'. another reviewer said it smelled like 'barnyard' and i think that's the best way to describe it. you do get used to it (and luckly the smell fades as your hair dries) but for me the smell was too much. i will buy again because i absolutely love the results but i will only use retread hair conditioner when i know i will be home the next day to spare others from the smell ",positive
" it is a very good conditioner. it is light and yet conditioning. but to me it smells like hay or cud or something cowish. it smells distinctively barnyard. but i see that many like the smell so maybe it is just me. ",positive
" is there anyone who doesn't know the name sarah jessica parker? okay. think carrie on tv's enormously successful sex and the city. she was the gal who dressed to the nines - always with style and glamour. she brings both of those qualities to her first fragrance lovely sarah jessica parker. it's a unique almost indescribable blend of classicism chic and innocence. there's not a scent like it with top notes of fresh mandarin bergamot lavender and apple martini. vibrant and warm it's a fragrance that caresses the senses. middles notes are patchouli tender paper whites and luxe orchid. these are enhanced by bottom notes of irresistible white amber sensuous cedar and the very sultry musk. this is a scent i revel in and enjoy wearing. the bottle is of course simple and exquisite curved with polished glass ultra feminine. lovely sarah jessica parker is a beautiful dreamy yet quite alive fragrance appropriate for every occasion. - gail cooke ",positive
" i have sensitive acne prone combination skin (oily in the t-zone). i've used various toners for months at a time and this is the first toner that doesn't burn when i use it. it reminds me of a better smelling witchhazel astringent -i used witchhazel as a kid to help prevent my skin from breaking out. it has a nice fruity scent which is great since most toners (especially clinique) smell like alcohol. i just wish it was a little cheaper! the bottle is pretty big so it will last me for 3 months which makes the price not quite so painful. i use it with the clarifiance oil free gel cleanser morning and night ",positive
" i normally do not like anything with a sandalwood scent..but this stuff is absolutely wonderfull! they are not lying when they refer to it as an addictive scent in the description..i got a small sample bottle and fell in love...it is perfect for the winter/fall seasons not so much for the summer. it's fun when people ask what i'm wearing and i get to casually say prada. considering i live in tennessee most people have no idea what that means..but i still feel special ",positive
" rice bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. after just one to two uses you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. this is especially apparent if you layer the products first using the cleanser toner and then the essence and skin creams. if you have oily or combination skin you may be amazed at how balanced your skin becomes. the skin essence contains mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging. the antioxidants help to revitalize the skin. this is applied before the cream. who knew when we were climbing around in mulberry trees staining our fingers and faces as children that one day we would use an extract in a lotion that would heal the skin and lighten our skin. age spots and freckles literally start to disappear or may even slightly whiten more than the surrounding skin so they literally seem to fade away. i noticed this after just a few uses so it is super effective. another reason to use this product is the super and i mean super fast healing properties. i was amazed. put this on any skin irritation and watch it disappear in days. these products are so fun to use i've incorporated them into a little night routine for my husband where i give him an antiaging facial before bed. i saw the results of the products on my skin and wanted to share this secret with him. his skin looked instantly more hydrated and he has dry skin. with my combination skin i've seen great results in balancing and clarity. the cleansers are like the champagne of skincare and the rest of the line is equally impressive. these are sort of out of my price range if i they didn't last so long and were not so effective. you only need such a small amount so in the end it will be very economical and the results are superior to other products i've tried. the products also seem to encourage a natural exfoliation and deep cleansing so you save money on all those other products you used to have to buy all the time. plus your skin will clear up and you can say goodbye to all those annoying costly solutions to a problem these products actually prevent. the entire line deserves 100 stars! if you struggle to keep your skin clear these products also provide a new sense of confidence and are emotionally healing. another surprising use for this product is on scars. old scars and new scars. they seem to just fade away. as liv tyler once said: i swear buy. well she was talking about the shampoo. i say: collect them. these products are essential and the best i've ever tried. ~the rebecca review ",positive

" about two weeks ago i got a very small metal splinter embedded in one of my fingers when i picked up an old office magnifying glass that had a corroded metal trim piece. i used my conventional tweezers and managed to break off a piece leaving an even smaller piece that i could hardly see still in my finger. my conventional tweezers could only push it further into my flesh so i quit trying to get it out. it wasn't doing any harm surrounded by upper skin layers so i looked for the best tweezers i could find and ordered these. i got them a few days ago at work and within a few minutes i had that teeny tiny splinter out of my finger. these are great ",positive
" i am obviously addicted to philosophy but it's a good addiction. my skin looks great better than it ever has in my life! whenever i feel like doing something for myself i try a new philosophy product because it's sure to give me a lift. this product is called a microdelivery peel but i view (and use) it more as a toner. philosophy's two-part microdelivery peel is awesome and i would not attempt to replace it with these pads. with the two part peel you clean your face with purity made simple cleanser then massage in the abrasive crystals. after a few minutes you squeeze out a little of the liquid which mixes with the crystals on your face and heats up infusing your skin with vitamin c and other healthy goodies. that is a real peel! these little pads on the other hand are cool refreshing and subtle. you can use them every day and they won't make your skin red. they freshen your skin and you know they contain great things that will help your skin because they are made by philosophy ",positive

" after years of searching i've finally found the perfect perfume. pink sugar makes me feel fabulous when i wear it; it's so light and `warm' with a base of sensual vanilla. i have the large bottle body mousse & deodorent at home and the smaller bottle in my handbag. i don't get bored with this fragrence like i do with everything else i've tried over the years. the first time i wore pink sugar to work one colleague commented on the aroma of drinking chocolate as i was in the lift with her. the next time i was in the lift everyone commented on my lovely vanilla perfume. after i applied a freshen up spray another colleague said she could smell cakes! yet another colleague demanded to know what i was wearing and where she could get some. strangers come up to me in the street to ask what scent i'm wearing... no this isn't a cheesy ad it really happened!! what do i sense first? liquorice a rich aniseed scent that gradually settles into a middle note of caramel. marshmallow is the first word that springs to mind to me. if you like angel fantasy or princess you need to give this a try! *aquolina needs to make pink sugar available to the u.k. - postage and packing costs a fortune!!!

" i use this purely as shower gel/cleanser and absolutely love it. the smell is great - not too overpowering and really perks me up in the morning. it reminds me of the lemonade stands i used to have as a kid. easily one of my favorite philosophy fragrances. i also recommend falling in love and strawberry daquiri. in fact i don't think you could go wrong with any philosophy products!

" i am impressed with this new scent by philosophy. it seems just like lemon pudding that my mom likes so well. definitely a new fave ",positive
" i received a free sample during clinique days at my local department store. i wore it the next day to work and received several compliments on how clean and light it smelled. two coworkers even went out within the next week and purchased some for themselves. it is perfect for a light clean scent during the day... to wear to work or a day out with friends or that special someone. it smells wonderful but not as though you are trying too hard. perfect ",positive
" the citrus touch in this perfume keeps it from being flowery and potentially old ladyish. it is not too strong even at first application but wears quite well. you will not feel as though you are wearing perfume; it seems far too light for that. i would certainly recommend it for its versatility as well ",positive
" it's a lovely light refreshing perfume. lovely for daywear. loves it guys ",positive
" i love this perfume because it really lifts my mood. i always thought of it as a little more citrus-y but it's just a very fun perfume. it's also nice because it's fun and flirty but still mature in a young professional type of way--if that makes any sense. ultimately it's a great perfume and i wear it almost daily ",positive
" this product is wonderful for individuals with very dry skin. i usually apply this cream right before i put my foundation on and it works very well together. it leaves my skin feeling very moist without it being sticky. in addition to that it's got a luscious cucumber smell to it. i would highly reccomend this product to those who are seeking to get rid their moisture thirsting skin. *although it may be alittle costly it will last you about 4 months~ ",positive
" i have amazing grace pure grace baby grace and falling in love. these are the only scents i use now. but falling in love was a bigger bottle than the other three and i'm almost out of it. this is the best i've ever smelled. ",positive
" i absolutely love this fragrance. i like and use a lot of philosophy products. the only problem i have is that it doesn't last long. when i do put it on i get a lot of compliments when it's fresh ",positive
" i really love this gift set..you will smell sooo yummy!! at first when i put it on it smelled so familiar then my husband and i decided it reminds us of sweet cotton candy..we love it! although now i am getting hooked on amazing grace...also a familiar clean fresh scent. philosophy is great ",positive
" i have used these for years and when i run out my skin knows and shows the difference. i have super sensitive skin that tends to become red and itchy when exposed to any kind of change in weather....cold or hot. i carry these in my purse and have them stashed all over the house....misting my face many times a day....voila....clear and moisterized skin! they really do work wonders on sensitive facial skin and they keep mine from being red and itchy which makes me very happy ",positive
" these are just great for cooling of quickly without a sticky feeling...unable to find them in the stores. ",positive
" love this for hot summer days dry winter days and hot flashes :) a must have for catching the vapors also good when out in the sun.. ",positive
" i don't have excessively oily skin but i've never been able to wear mascara without smudging. waterproof smudgeproof expensive drugstore you name it i've tried it. every single one left dark shadows under my eyes within 2 or 3 hours. i'd given up on mascara completely but thought i'd try one more time with this (with the money back guarantee from spalook what's the risk?) this mascara lives up to it's name as smudge-proof. even wearing sunscreen on my under-eye area it doesn't transfer. even in 100+ deg phoenix heat it stays. i *love* it for this reason. it also comes off easily at night; no problems there. however i'm giving it only 4 stars because it does flake a little throughout the day. not a lot and not enough to make me stop using it (the first truly smudge-proof mascara i've found) but it is there. since it's advertised as smudge and flake-proof i can't give it the full 5 stars ",positive
" ever wished you could rub your eyes while you're wearing your make up? now you can. you can't be rubbing at your eyes too much or it will start to flake off but this mascara takes quite a beating before it will budge and will never ever smudge. one might be led to believe this means it is difficult to remove at night but all you need to remove it is water. this stuff is practically worth getting just to ponder the chemistry involved ",positive
" this mascara is great it's easy to remove with a little warm water but the best thing about it is that it won't give you 'racoon eyes'. there's no dis-coloration of the skin around the eyes. it also keeps looking great all through the day no need to re-apply it. the only reason i am not giving it 5 stars is that even though they come in different colors they all look more black than colored when dry. so the color doesn't stand out enough. still i can highly recommend it ",positive
" philosophy products are very eye catching. their smart clean looking bottles and the cool names given to each. i work with skin care products and don't always believe what they claim. there are usually far too many claims to be made that simply can't be done to someones skin. this product however is pretty good. it's a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product but it does do the job it promises. the only problem i have with it is that for someone with sensitive skin there is far too much frangrant extracts in here. it cannot be good for sensitive skin. i'd recommend this to dry skin people only ",positive
" i have suffered from rosacia for the past nine years. as i was fairly young to be starting through a change of life i had no idea what was causing my complexion problems. not understanding (or expecting)what was happening to my skin i made many many mistakes during the first year or so trying to remedy the symptoms with countless products formulated more for adult acne or aging tired skin bad idea. if you have rosacea or very sensitive skin you know that sometimes it seems that all you need do is touch your skin the wrong way and you break out let alone slathering some chemically based perfumed or exfoliating (ground pits and the like) product on your face. this becomes especially discouraging when you are also beginning to see the normal signs of aging but sensitivities won't allow you to take advantage of some of the great treatments out there to nourish your skin and stay a step ahead of the wrinkles not to mention feeling starved for the moisture which is the real key to younger healthy looking skin. after awhile i was afraid to try anything else so i just stopped. i washed my face gently and left it at that. well it only got worse and i felt like a dried up prune. enter philosophy hope in a jar for dry sensitive skin. it's as if this product was made just for me. now instead of people asking me what's wrong with your face? they ask what type of skincare do you use? since i've been using the philosophy skin care line i find i guite often feel comfortable going out without makeup something i had rarely done since my twenties. since sun protection is so important philosophy offers a product called when hope is not enough with spf 20 for daytime which comes in a bottle but i have found that my skin responds much better to the hope in a jar-dry sensitive formula then followed by philosophy's seperate sunsreen called shelter-spf 15. this is because shelter does not contain vitamin c or peptides and has a slightly lower concentration of sunscreens contrary to the spf-20 moisurizer combo. you may be able to get by with the combination product and save a few bucks but the aforementioned ingredients in it do not agree with my sensitivities especially the vitamin c. as for the much needed exfoliation dilemma try philosophy's micro-delivery peel pads or their peel kit both are soothing and non-abrasive. hope this helps and enjoy your new skin! ",positive
" i love everything about these sops!!! they are luxurious and delicious at the same time......one thing i need to indulge in. the scents last for days after you've used them.....my bathroom still smells like a mix of verbena and honey-almond!!!! just scrumptious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not to mention how your skin smells and feels afterwards! these are amazing soaps that everyone should use. i feel exquisite using them and the gift sets are a fabulous thing to give to friends or even aquaintences. they are sure to think of how thoughtful you were to give it to them everytime they use this wonderful soap!!!!!! ",positive
" with just a hint of sheer red color this lip balm in a tube is one of the best i've tried. the smell is intoxicating the feel divine. what's best to me: 1) the subtle shade of red color sheer but sexy moisturizing but not greasy or gloppy and 2) it lasts forever. i have never before paid $10 for a tube of lip balm but i will gladly do it again. for those that wonder who it looks good on: my opinion is everybody! i am a dark-brown haired light skinned brown-eyed girl with no pink or rosy color to my natural dead-white skin color/coloring. i burn easily and freckle too. my sister has brownish-auburn-hair medium-toned beige skin color with hazel-brown eyes and it looks great on her too. she tans easily. my niece is blondish-brown haired has light brown eyes and fair skin with a bit of pink in it and tans easily. it looked great on her too. buy it and enjoy it ",positive
" someone turned me on to this eye cream and it's been like getting an extra hour of sleep a night ever since. the best trick? keep it in the fridge. apply after you shower - you can feel it tightening away ",positive
" wonderfully light and clean scent! both men and women have asked me what i was wearing hours after i thought the scent was gone. it does not overpower when layering lotion and spray. it's a beautiful fragrance i love it ",positive
" this is one of my favorite perfumes. i love anything vanilla and this has a great combination of it with violets musk and iris. it is a strong smell so go easy on it. one spray lasts all day. ",positive
" i have had this for many years lasts a long time and doesnt seem to get that old smell even after five years. it is very unique and the scent has a 'rich quality' to it. the scent seems to change as the day goes on i really like it ",positive
" this has been my everyday scent for the last six years. the predominent note is a sparkling anise an anise that affects a cold even metallic chemic artifice. swirling about this shivery base note are hints of moss violet and vanilla-like tonka lending an aura of both forest and fantasy. though this is a relatively popular scent lolita eschews convention. there are no white flowers no rose no peach none of the banal and cloying sweetness that plagues so many scents. this perfume is instead sensual yet apart not at all come-hither but insinuating and dark as a grimm's tale. the tonka is sweet and powdery gently seductive while the more prominent anise intoxicates. the bottle is stunning; i never throw out a spent one. ",positive
" this perfume isn't comparible to anything - finally a totally unique scent! it's sweet and sexy and the scent changes with you. i'm addicted to it. so are the men! ; ",positive
" i used the same mascara for years i came across bourjois pump up the volume on an internet site so i thought i'd give it a go it really does pump up those lashes and it stays put for most of the day too i use this mascara all the time now i think its great ",positive
" i got this as a gift last christmas and i loved it. the scent is very nice and actually lasts. i give britney credit for this one. i need to replace it already thats how much ive used it its almost gone. i recommend this one. ",positive
" i love love love this product! this powder/foundation has the best coverage out there! i don't like to wear liqued foundation because it makes my skin feel real oily. this powder foundation is better than any out there ",positive
" i love to include one of these with gifts......people love them.....makes a bath really special.....little rosebuds floating in the water.....just charming ",positive
" orris root powder has a scent similar to violets although in this tisty tosty bath bomb even with the addition of rose oil it is not an overpowering fragrance. i think they could add double the rose oil but you can add in rose and ylang ylang if you are in the mood. the tisty tosty heart-shaped bath bomb is perfect if you enjoy blending your own essential oils or prefer a mild/calming bathing experience. i'd suggest using this one for skin calming and also adding in a romance in a stone sex bomb or chelsea garden bath bomb to add a little more romance to the bath. i did feel emotionally calm (rose balances the emotions) and my skin loved this bath bomb but it was not as sensory as i'd hoped. following this bath with the it's a pleasure treasure massage bar is fun also heart-shaped. you may want to try the violet soap with this bathing experience. the next time i try this i might mix it with an elixir bath melt and a bit of the bathos bubble bar also scented with violet. as far as this being a magic spell you just never know who might call you when you use this bath. probably right when you are in the bath. so if you think this will work instantly you might want to keep the phone by the tub. it was funny but when i was in the bath my husband was trying to call me and said he let the phone ring and ring. did he really think i would leave the pleasure of a lush bath to answer the phone? personally i think they should scent this bath bomb like the it's a pleasure treasure massage bar. it is blissfully delicious and almost seems edible - looks like white chocolate (it is mostly cocoa butter) and has a heady scent of orange blossom honey and neroli. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" this smells good and the heart shape is cute. but it lost it's scent when it dissolved which was dissipointing and the flowers turned the water darkish. i liked it but it's not one of my favorites. ",positive
" if you love roses this is a romantic bath luxury with seven rose buds for your bathing delight. for a candlelit bath with romance let it dissolve unencumbered. for scent but no mess put it in a mesh bag first because little flower bits will be all over the tub. at least it has no glitter. the scent is not particularly strong but it is full of a natural rose scent that smells wonderful ",positive
" i have been using lush products for a few years now. first introduced to them when i was in australia. i always keep some in my linen closet as it gives a faint wonderful scent to all the sheets and pillowcases. try all of the bath bombs. i use the tisty tosty whenever i need an evening of self indulgence. put the water on and watch the heart-shaped bomb fizzle and send hundreds of rose petals floating to the top of the tub. put some fluffy bath towels to warm on a rail. place some dr haushka's oil to heat by a radiator. pour a glass of champagne. surround the tub with lots of tea lights. put on some rahman music. get in and imagine a private ganges. when you get out its very eassy to scoop up the petals- take the pre-warmed towels and wrap yourself in one. by then the oils will be warm and pour in palm of hand and rub on body. i also like to put some bath bombs in guest bedrooms with the towels- if you haven't tried the karma soap do try it ......alone or with someone special.. ",positive
" this is the one you give to someone you love. the wonderful rose scent is very light not overpowering at all. and the pretty little dried rosebuds are so charming. i love lying in the tub with those rosebuds floating around me. it makes me feel like i'm lying in a beautiful garden ",positive
" well for startes this is one of the best cologes out there. the smell is chrisp and will last a long time. it is a great cologne for any acasion. i have many colognes and this one is on the top of my list very masculine but girls love it!!!! ",positive
" i had read about these new creme eyeshadows in one of the magazines within the last few months. i decided to go to the counter at the bloomingdale's near my house. the sa at the counter said she thought based on my coloring and eyes that the rose gold would be a good choice for me. i was looking for a shadow that could be good for daytime and also nighttime. i took home the rose gold and it was really really beautiful on. not only that but it is long-lasting and doesn't crease. i may have to invest in one or more of the other colors available. definitely a worthwhile purchase and the tube will last you a long time. ",positive
" i love this soap! it smells so fresh and my skin feels great after i wash with it! i am definetely ordering more of this soap ",positive
" this product is great! i had always been a non believer but in the eight month with my second pregnancy when i could not take the strecth marks the itching the pain the red skin i used it and it was like magic. three days of use and i am a new person with soooo much better skin getting better everyday ",positive
" i am 5'11 tall and have stretchmarks everywhere from growing 8 inches in one year as an adolescent. so i thought i'd get even more of them during my pregnancy and 40 lb. weight gain. i bought the mustela lotion as a might as well gift to myself not really expecting anything. i am thrilled to say that after using this cream every day on my breasts and belly during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy i didn't get any new stretchmarks anywhere. i still can't believe it -- and i was looking closely for them just to be sure. the lotion is quite rich so a little goes a long way -- the tube lasted 8 weeks. i'm completely sold on mustela products and use the super soft and fragrant baby wipes on my new little girl. no diaper rash at all so far ",positive
" i started using this cream during my 2nd month of pregnancy. i think it's important to start building the elasticity of your skin early on which could be the reason i had success with it. while the cream is kindof expensive-- when you think about avoiding stretchmarks no price is too high. i used about 4 tubes for the duration. i expected to get stretchmarks because my mom had them with me so i was happy to get anything less than hers. anyway i didn't get any at all on my stomach until the last two weeks (my baby was 8lbs. 8oz.) and they are really small. i put the cream on my breasts and abdomen every day after a shower but because it was expensive i skipped my sides (love handle area) and did get stretchmarks there which were darker than the ones on my stomach. since my stomach has gone down the ones on my stomach are very light and will probably go away enough to satisfy my ego. i highly recommend giving the mustela cream a chance ",positive
" i first tried this when my mum bought a bottle during her holiday in november. the weather was cold wet & dark at home. when i sprayed some on my wrists i wasn't impressed. come june & sunny hot & bright days i found myself trying `just me' in the shops & buying a bottle (which i'm quickly making my way through). lighter & easier to wear then `paris hilton' i'm using it all the time. scent wise; the strongest note for me is the pink peppercorn - sharp & tangy. it contrasts nicely with the floral notes so neither individual note overpowers me. overall `just me' can be worn anywhere during the day; work shopping or lunch. for evening and autumn/winter look elsewhere.

" i experianced a small problem that was completly resolved to my satisfaction. what a great company to do buisness with ",positive
" i'm 18! well you will think what does 18 have to do with this cream. i don't have any wrinkle. my skin has been really good until i get into college. my eyes become really tired and i start to have a lot of dark circle plus puffiness. after reading a recommendation from a fashion magazine which says everybody at every age need an eye cream. ok fine i will get one. i chose the one got the highest rate! overall quality it is very good to moisturize my eye area. this means it is easier to apply foundation/concealer/eye makeup. but my puff is still here. i still have dark circle! no reducing! i know that i need to have a better schedule to have enough sleep but still i expected higher on this product. about the size the small little teeny tiny one is good enough for you to use for months. usually i will use it at night. when i have to apply concealer i will apply another time.

" don't be afraid to smile and don't cover up those smile lines. you can eliminate them with this amazing product from clinique ",positive
" i received a tube of philosophy's cinnamon buns flavored lip gloss for christmas (along with other philosophy products). i was super excited to try this because i've been told by numerous people that philosophy's products are spectacular. first i must point out that there are sparkles in this lip gloss. although they're very subtle on your lips if you're the type of gal who hates sparkles and shimmer in your makeup i'd stay away from this product. as for smell it does smell like cinnamon buns. it certainly does not taste like it however (which is a good thing... i tend to lick off my lip gloss if it tastes good... this lip gloss does not taste good). it's very sticky and thick so you don't have to use too much. it also stays on your lips for a good amount of time. would i suggest this product? if you're looking for a good-smelling long lasting lip gloss i'd definitely recommend this. however if these two things don't matter to you i'd suggest you skip this ($10 for a tube of lip gloss isn't cheap after all) and go for a drugstore brand lip gloss ",positive
" i was pretty wary of buying this because of the price but it really is worth it. the can has lasted me almost a year and it's not even empty! it's wonderful! i have very oily acne prone skin with rosacea and this stuff makes me look like i have a flawless beautiful complexion. and i'm not exaggerating. it feels like i'm not wearing makeup. i just can't say enough about it. this is the one thing that i couldn't live without. you need to try it!!! ",positive
" i have been looking high and low for a fragrance that wasn't strong. i have tried so many perfumes and body sprays it is ridiculous. i have finally found the one i will use for more than a week. i love it! the smell is so clean and simple. the first day i wore it i had 3 seperate people tell me i smelled good. i have never had even one person tell me that let alone 3. i was amazed. also i noticed that they told me i smelled good. they didn't say your perfume smells good. i am not sure how to describe the smell. it reminds me of that out-of-the-shower fresh smell that we wish we could have all day. i will never use any other fragrances but philosophy fragrances. i plan on trying all their other wonderful scents as well ",positive
" i have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate by the end of the as other products have. also my coloring is very fair red hair and blue eyes even with brown/black mascara i always looked a little off-matched. the brown in this line is a beautiful color and looks more natural than any i have ever used. the ease of removal is the icing on the cake ",positive
" most waterproof mascaras are designed to come off with an oil-based remover. stupid idea; our skin has oil in it. after a couple hours we end up with racoon eyes. doh who needs that? mirenesse mascara only comes off with soap and water in combination. better living through chemistry! since i happen to be one of those people with a little extra oil in their skin in adulthood i especially appreciate this fact plus they make it in brown/black i'm a redhead and am so sick of searching for something other than black-black mascara! it is simply too dark if you are not a brunette or blonde. i need something with some brown in it and this mascara fits the bill perfectly. for those who find it too clumpy well learn how to apply mascara--tweens! this mascara goes on best with one coat so make your first application count. you don't need a second coat. it won't look good so do one coat period. if you can't get it right the first time you need some practice and a mirror with a higher magnification. if you think you need more mascara than that think again. unless you are walking sunset ",positive

" i really loved the clean citrus scent of tommy girl. it has a grapefruit-like scent--very clean and pungent. unfortunately after i became pregnant and had my son my body chemistry changed. now it stinks on me. :o( still it smells great as a scent but you may want to try a tester before buying it. this is one of those fragrances that i think are a bit risky to buy sight unseen...unless you're sure your gal absolutely loves clean citrusy pungent scents. (but remember that doesn't mean it will smell good on her... ",positive
" this product is the best. my youngest daughter used it at my home and said she wanted the margarita then my oldest daughter said the same. i like them both equally. do follow the directions ",positive
" the first thing you notice is the clean burst of citrus. it's yummy and fresh and sexy. then the fragrance reveals its deeper layers and you are drawn in. this is a wonderful fragrance for men. both of vera wang's fragrances (for men and women) are top quality multi layered emminently pleasing and would make fabulous gifts. buy this for your man and enjoy ",positive
" put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling. your dark circles will be concealed and you'll look wide awake ",positive
" this is truly the best in highlighting products and i have tried many high end and cheaper products out there. this is so light and just doesn't get all cakey and greasy. i have tried so many brands that claim to look natural but they just don't. this really does and don't let the price fool you either. it only takes alittle and lasts a long time so well worth the price for the look it gives. i love this! ",positive
" i've been using touche eclat ever since it came out. i still love it. cannot believe how rested i look after i put this on. my dark circles are minimized & i look radiant. till now no other concealer can beat ysl's touche eclat. can't live without this product! ",positive
" well worth the money and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag ",positive
" i'm giving this product 4 stars for how well this pencil blends with any brow color....i would think for people who use and like to define brows with pencil this is a perfect neutral color.i subtracted one star because i prefer to apply brow definers with brow powder and a brush. i think it looks more natural.. brenda christian makes a brow powder which i prefer over pencils but the color of this pencil is far superior to any powder i can find. sometimes i mix the two. i start with the pencil and add a bit of powder. all all it's the color of this pencil that is superior to all other eyebrow pencils ",positive
" i like that the gloss isn't goopy or sticky and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while but you don't get much product. i bought flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips. i wasn't really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen. but overall i do like it but don't know if i'd buy it again ",positive
" i bought this item as a gift but i have used philosophy products in the past. they are wonderful and have an amazing fragrance!! and they produce amazing lather ",positive
" i found this sent the most amazing. i found it in the december 2006 issue of gq i was determined to find it. i found it. i was so excited. i work at a fast food restraunt and i put prada amber on before my 8 hour shift and tords the end of my shift people could still smell this fragrance. i was so excited. i would recomind this to anyone. who wants to feel safistacated.

" bought this for my boyfriend and i can't stop smelling him because it's unlike any other cologne i've ever come upon. it's so intriguing that i find myself sniffing him just to get another whiff of it. i can best describe it as a soft-suede with hints of amber vanilla and wood. it smells better after it's been on the skin for a while. it does have a slight feminine scent however this makes me like it more and makes me want him to wear it more. it's definetely for a confident man ",positive
" eternity was signature scent of the late 80's early 90's and has been around long enough to gain a rightful classic status now. it is one of the best on the market it smells classy clean zingy and has more than a touch of the erotic about it. always worth having a bottle handy even if you don't wear it everyday it is a yummy scrummy scent ",positive
" i absolutely love this eyeshadow. i have it in three different colors as after my first one (the illuminateur) i got addicted. i've since bought the ambre and the bleu swimming pool. it can be hard to tell from pictures on this site or any other what the color of this item is really like. that is it say it changes depending on the light. my white illuminateur looks purple in some lights shiny white in others and a light blue in others. it's really amazing on its own or layered. all of the colors have a lot of oomph to them. make sure you shake the bottle before using for best color results (as mentioned on the packaging). as someone who doesn't own a lot of makeup brushes i love that it includes one. however i have noticed with these and with other brands of eyeshadow that have similar packaging if you're not careful you can bend some of the bristles backwards (and they may stay that way) when reinserting the brush. simply solved by not rushing. : ",positive
" glamorous mysterious seductive all describe armani code a captivating orange blossom based scent from giorgio armani fragrance. as one would expect from this master couturier the bottle itself is a gem. tapering from a weighted base the slim flacon seems to glow as lacquered shades of blue sweep from an early dawn at the bottom of the sleek holder to midnight nearing the top. adding to the fragrance's intrigue is an oriental effect achieved by lace embroidery on the glass. the scent is sweet yet sensuous with a sparkle provided by orange zest. with orange blossom at its heart armani code is enhanced by sambac jasmine madagascan vanilla and honey. the man in my life called it delicious and i do too. it's now high on my list of favorite fragrances. - gail cook ",positive

" this is by far my favorite mascara and i've tried hundreds' i have very few and very short lashes. this mascara pumps them up makes them look twice as long!.. love love lov ",positive
" i don't know how many mascaras i own but there's always about two or three that i hold as my favorite or just for different occasions. one of those is hypnose and i really like it for when i go out or just looking for that dramatic look. postive: 1.) the look: i've never neccessarily wanted to wear fake eyelashes but they do look almost perfect. unbelievably hypnose gives you that look. it's amazing just how feathery your eyelashes look. 2.) flaking: this mascara never really flaked on the bottom of my eyes. that's really important to me. negative: 1.) this mascara starts out great but after about two and a half weeks it starts emptying out on you. this might just be because there were days when i reapplyed it or simply because i just used it pretty well (1 coat just about everyday because of how much i liked it). summary: if you want that natural yet are those real lashes?! look then you'll like this mascara. i'm giving it four stars instead of five simply because of how long it lasts but if you use it once it a while then it will last you a while ",positive
" i was very impressed with the texture of these shadows. they slip on softly with a great feel and last all day or night with no creasing. i also like the way the colors will go on subtley with a light touch or with a heavier hand build up for more intensity. the color selection is gorgeous. just one word of warning -- you can't really go by the color samples. it's better to see them in person. i bought lilac mist which is beautiful on the brow bone and was very close to what i was expecting. but paris by night looks like a gray but is actually a deep mauve. i was dissapointed until i tried it. it contoured my eyes beautifully and while intense is very natural looking. this is about the fourth time i've bought laura mercier products and i've been totally pleased with the quality. ",positive
" like the powder blush this eye shadow is silky not chalky. it goes on sheer and looks natural but beautiful. all of the colors i've tried are very nice. toasted almond is a wonderful ivory. american coffee is a rich brown (but doesn't go on too dark -- you can layer it for more drama) caramel is a creamy beige. this is a great product for everyday. note: you will need an eye shadow brush for this just as you need a blush brush -- it does not come with one ",positive
" i have used this product for the past 16 years. it is wonderful!the super double face powder is actually a foundation and matte powder all rolled into one product. the product comes with an application sponge goes on dry gives superb coverage! i don't even use my clinique concelar when i wear this product it is that good! this product works best with those individuals who have normal or combination skin. ",positive
" as someone who really dislikes making up but needs a bit of cover in her face powder i have found clinique's superpowder to be just the right product. i have been using it for nearly ten years. in between superpowder purchases i have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product. it is truly no muss no fuss. no foundation or concealers just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally. no powdery bits sitting on the skin surface no flaking ... and stays on all day with nary a touch up ... just perfect ",positive
" this is a fantastic product and lasts forever so the relatively steep cost is not so bad. this is a great product for using under eye makeup because it makes the eye makeup slip on better and stay on longer or alone for a natural but still 'put-together' look. i love this product more than mascara and haven't found anything like it in other product lines.

" i have never found a compact foundation cream or powder that looked and lasted even remotely as well as a liquid foundation with a dusting of powder over it. until now. this is an amazing makeup and the best part is that it doesn't take a whole lot of product to achieve perfect coverage. my skin tends to be red but this doesn't even hint at it. plus it's a nice matte without being too dry. for everyday this is my time saving face perfecting miracle.

" for a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is mac. lipglass feels good on your lips as if it contained some emollients. and (this is a big and) it's not tacky or sticky. the colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood occasion and skin tone. they range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. another plus (and this is a big plus following the big and) mac lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. try adding a lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. enjoy! gail cook ",positive

" mac lipglass is the absolute best. there are plenty of colors to choose from super-shiny and the gloss is thick stays on and doesn't run. the best colors are.... nico for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. oystergirl is a shimmery baby pink. oh baby is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick. chai looks amazing with black smokey eyes. it's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine ",positive
" i'm really anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla but mac lipglass isn't that vanilla-ish at all! it's got very pigmented color it stays on a long time for a gloss and each tube lasts a long time... don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off ",positive
" i thought this stuff smelled fantastic and very similar to a lavender poundcake. i guess smell is very subjective though so if you're not sure about this one you might want to have a sniff at your local sephora or department store before purchasing ",positive
" i received this as a gift and love it. i don't normally use dusting powders but this is light and silky. the scent is very patchouli which i happen to like. sort of reminds me of the head shops from the 60's-70's. i especially like the fact that all lush products are natural without a lot of chemicals ",positive
" this product is amazing! i have very dry skin and this just soaks inleaving my skin soft and rejuvenated for days.i even have used it for my shampoo @ times with good results theretoo. ",positive
" a time saver. slap in on while still wet right after your shower; instant moisturization if you've got to jump in jump out and go. and it smells delicious ",positive
" this tool is great for removing whiteheads and blackheads both. as a rn with dermatology experience i have used many tools i like this one as it saves you from bruising or squishing your skin. so it solves the problem with a minimum of damage. if you haven't used anything like this it may take some getting used to but it's way better than using your fingers. i gave it 4 of 5 stars as it can be a bit difficult to line up because the hole is so small ",positive
" i love this scent - it's so fresh yet so distinctive. light enough to wear to a ballet or other event where you're in close qurters with others but distinct enough that people notice it. every time i wear it i get compliments on how great i smell. ",positive
" i really smell the peach in this and thats why i love it. i love how its mixed in with the powdery florals. its not heavy its sexy without trying too hard and there is something old fashioned about it but it has a modern twist. i love this perfume ",positive
" soft sensual - made me feel feminine and attractive - my husand agrees ",positive
" i am so sick of all the fragrances out there that smell like chocolate pie or cake. why people want to smell like food puzzles me. that's why i was so glad to find a feminine floral scent with a little tease to it. maybe baby is delightful not too heavy but making its presence known. the complements will flow. it's sweet (not too sweet though) and innocent while at the same time being flirty. if i had to pick a season it reminds me of it would be spring. i can't describe a frangrance anymore than i can describe a wine but with all the stinkers out there i just had to put in a good word for this very wearable scent. ",positive
" if you love the scent of the bathina line benefit has finally come out with an eau de toilette with the same scent. i wear this scent everyday and i always get compliments. i love to put the scent in my hair because it lingers in hair longer than skin. many scents smell different on different skin types but maybe baby is a pretty true scent. i guaruntee you will absolutely love this perfume and so will everyone around you. : ",positive
" ok i have really large lips and for years i have tried everything to protect them. get this tin for some reason the stick doesn't work as well and your lips will be unchapped for the whole day. it's pricey but worth every penny if your like me and your lips chap easily. trust me i have tried everything even pricier chapsticks and this one does the trick ",positive
" l'occitane combined their famous lavender note with touches of peach marigold and freesia to create a lovely fresh and relaxing scent. it's a nice one to wear before bed too not overpowering. in the summer i look for fragrances that contain natural notes mosquitoes do not care for and lavender is one of them. the peach note in some fragrances also turns funky on my skin but i have not had this problem with eau de recolte bleue. i prefer this over their lavender harvest fragrance which i think would smell better on men (jmop.) here is a description from their website: eau de la rcolte bleue exudes all the pleasures of provence. both fresh and as light as air it captures the celebratory feel of the lavender harvest. composed from a blend of the green scent of leaves and a.o.c. lavender essential oil eau de la rcolte bleue is accompanied by the delicate notes of freesia marigold and frosted peach. woody and musky aromas then leave a lingering and sensual fragrant trail. all in all i find this soft gentle and thoroughly wearable. especially enjoy it on a summer evening.

" i have been using this cream for almost 2 months now and the results are amazing. my sun spots are lightened and it has also decreased the redness on my face. i will continue to use it and highly recommend it. ",positive
" growing up worshiping the sun had finally taken its toll on my skin. as of late i have noticed sun spots on my face chest and hands (yuck!). my esthetician recommended i try murad's age spot and pigment lightening gel. in about a month i noticed the spots beginning to fade! it is super light weight and soaks in fast too! now all i have to do is remember the sunscreen.. ",positive
" simplify simplify simplify! that's what i try to do with my beauty routine. hence i was first attracted to laura mercier's facial cleanser by its name one-step cleanser. i'm staying with it because it works. no more separate purchases for eyemake removers or deep cleansers. one-step cleanser removes all traces of makeup even from the delicate eye area and leaves my skin feeling clean supple and nourished. it's both easy and effective ",positive
" put the light back in highlight without that greasy feeling. your dark circles will be concealed and you'll look wide awake ",positive
" i like this product but am not sure it is worth the money. i have bought other products for $5 at my local store and i seem to have similar results ",positive
" i decided to try it out and have found the only soap i want to use. the fragrance is great it does not overpower. i guess the milling process gives the soap it's texture which removes the need for all those bath/shower accessories. and 1 bar lasted over 2 months. i will definitely be ordering more and trying other products this vendor carries ",positive
" the ground almond hulls are gentle enough for daily use of the soap directly on the skin without being scratchy. the scent is strong but not overpowering and both the soap and scent are long lasting. this soap is also so moisturizing that my skin doesn't require lotion as it does after most store brand soaps and shower gels. this particular soap is my main shower bar and my great experience with it convinced me to return to bar soap after years of being a bath and body works shower gel and lotion fiend. ",positive
" body so fine is the most beautiful and luxurious cosmetic i ever had. i recommend it because the description of benefit is absolutely real. it's the most delicious velvet and beautiful balm for the legs and the arms. also the retro - chic and vintage box and can are romantic and beautiful. perfect for me ",positive
" i got some of this body balm yesterday. the lady at the benefit counter said that it would make my skin look luminescent like a victoria's secret model. she put a sample on one of my arms and i held it up to the other arm. the difference was amazing! the arm with the bathina looked smoother silker and had a pearlized look. i can't stop raving about this stuff. it is slightly expensive but the tin is really big (and adorable) and the supply of the balm is huge. it should last a really long time. this balm is one of the best products that benefit has ",positive
" benefit claims that this is all you will want to wear and i am starting to think this might be true... first i have to say that the texture is intriguing. it's a balm but it feels much more velvety and the slight shimmer gives you a sheen. second i am a sucker for the packaging and presentation. it comes in a little tin box with the signature bathina (very retro chic) and a black powder puff that has a pink ribbon holder. it makes you want to apply the product in public just to have an excuse to show off the set. also it ups the feminity factor of applying a product with the little puff (very i adore being a girl...) then there's the scent. it's a floral sexy fragrance that doesn't overpower. it's clean and a big plus is that it doesn't make me sneeze like some other scents. i think that a little goes a long way and thus i can say that even though it's a boutique-brand product it is very affordable. i think that as warmer weather sets in and you want to show off a little more skin this is a product that would enhance a tan. ",positive
" i couldn't resist the very feminine and retro look of the packaging. and it does look cute in the bathroom. that being said this is great to add a layer of sheen to the legs. your calves look great without stockings. i find it too waxy to use on the rest of the body but there's nothing better on bare legs. to add a glow to the skin especially to a tan try benefit's flamingo fancy ",positive
" i've seen lots of negative feedback on the strawberry milkshake scent but i have to say i love it. this lotion takes me back to my child hood. it's got a strawberry quick/bubblegum smell to it. i think it's fun for summer days ",positive
" clinique's bare brilliance is one of my absolute favorite lipsticks ever! it has a fairly sheer finish with lovely little sparkles in it. i have berrylicious(sheer grape) and cherry quartz(sheer true red--doesn't look like it does on the color swatch) and neither overwhelms my pale skin. i wouldn't be caught dead without a bare brilliance lipstick in my makeup bag or purse! ",positive
" i use the dusty pink and i have never ever used a blush that looks so natural and makes my skin glow so healthy. with or without the mineral foundation from youngblood; just lovely. highly recommended ",positive
" i loveee this ring soo much .. it looks cute on my mdidle and index finger and the gloss is moisturizing with a touch of glitter .. all in one word: glam!! ",positive
" here's a gem of an idea for a small gift or stocking stuffer for the preteen girls on your list - a cute lip gloss ring from hard candy. the ring is heart shaped with a flip top filled with a lightly tinted sparkly lip gloss. it comes in three shades and glosses - heartbreaker which is a peach; kiss me which is hot pink and yummy which is baby blue. all are fruit scented. boxed in a ring box with a faceted lid (presentation you know) it's finger fun ",positive
" mastering the stencils does require some practice...but the color is good for blondes. i also follow up the powder with an eyebrow pencil to make my eyebrows look a little more defined. i think my eyebrows look better since using this product ",positive
" i loved this product. the stencils are easy to use and the instructions are easy to follow. the browns are a bit dark so if you have red in your hair like i do you might want to start out light you can always go darker if you need to ",positive
" after watching anastasia do eye brows on tv i decided that i needed to get this item and try to do better shaping of my eye brows. after receiving this kit i found that is is quite hard to do by yourself. holding the stencil in the proper alinement is difficult for one person to do on themselves. i do however shape my daughters brows. in conclusion i think that it takes a lot of skill and i think it would be better to go to her personally or some other experienced person. ",positive
" one time while in los angeles i had the forward thinking enough to book an appointment with anastasia because i'd seen her on oprah and in magazines and knew she was queen of the eyebrows. i thought if i had one appointment i could maintain them afterward myself. if you live nowhere near bev hills or aren't going to be in la this is the next best thing. it's like having her in your home permanently. the kit is fantastic. there are different colours to choose from and it's easy to use. it does look a little weird at first if you use the colour where there are no brows but i don't know if everyone can tell or we girls are just a little more fussy when it comes to ourselves. this is the best way to get the perfect shape and it really does make a difference to your face. you'll look better and ultimately feel better. the stencil is the best invention and i highly recommend it ",positive
" i love the product as an afterthought this was sent from sephora where with every purchase you receive a bonus sample and even free shipping if you qualify. wish i'd went to their site since i'm a frequent shopper there also oh well amazon is where i will buy books dvds etc.. ",positive
" this powder is great. it has great coverage without looking cakey. i also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be touched-up a little more often than other powders i've tried but it's worth it ",positive
" if you have smooth skin this product is not for you. my skin had no human quality about it; after i went through many procedures of bleaching and laser treatments. i suffer from extreme skin dryness uneven and dull skin. other lotions made my face look greasy or failed to give it that moisturised look. i have tried many products for my extreme dry dull skin issues and this is the first product that has worked for me. now my skin looks hydrated and normal. it is quite a feat ",positive
" wonderful shampoo. i have color treated hair and my color stays shiny and my hair is thicker after i shampoo. i use the shampoo daily and no longer have scalp problems from product buildup ",positive
" this is a great moisturizer for my hair and scalp. very light and smells great ",positive
" i was recommended this product for my son's hair and have had many recommendations over the years since he has beautiful thick curly hair that can tend to be dry and frizzy. i used a little of this product in his wet hair and it leaves it shiny with less frizz and more curls. he is 10 and not crazy about the smell but i think it smells nice. fantastic product ",positive
" i purchased this product based on the reviews and i can't begin to tell you how glad i am to have the hair honey. it is wonderful!! it leaves my hair looking absolutely healthy and bouncy. the smell was overwhelming at first but the benefits of what the product does for your hair are far greater. i will be using this for a long time to come ",positive
" i just started using carols daughters products but i really like the hair honey as an everyday moisturizer for my ends and to smooth my natural hair in the front. i just use a little water and hair honey tie a scarf for about ten minutes and my all-natural new growth is smooth soft and exactly where i want it to be without using harsh gels sprays or spritzes. i am using this and the cd healthy hair butter as a leave-in. i love the fact that its all natural ingredients that are really great and yummy for the hair. ",positive
" forgive me for the rhyme but the sentiment is true. this product is rich but at the same time light. after opening the jar i loved the way the hair honey smelled it has a sweet aroma but i didn't detect the cirtus smell in the product description. i am only sorry i didn't get the larger size. ",positive
" really enjoy using this as body wash. the smell is divine but the bubbles don't last long if used as a bubble bath or shampoo. moisturizing to my dry skin ",positive
" i originally bought this item because i was hoping for the same scent that yankee candle produces in their candle line. the smell is nice although it doesn't reach out and grab you like true buttercream. still it's nice to shower with and you won't be disappointed with the lather. i put a quarter sized amount on my shower puff and still had to ring out foam from it after i was finished. also the lather is creamy and it just feels like it is moisturizing your skin. all in all i am happy with my purchase. i only gave 4 stars because i like a stronger scent but if you like more subtlety i'm sure you'll enjoy it ",positive
" this concealer comes in a pencil form so it is very precise and offers very good coverage. it stays on well. it is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers so you can put it in a small precise spot and it will actually stay there. i have tried many concealers for small blemishes and this is my favorite. it comes in enough shades so you can find a good match which is important ",positive
" wear make up every day and i usually wear foundation eyeliner mascara eyeshadow and lip gloss. that's my every day make up. by the end of the day i have to get it off in order to sleep well. lancome make up remover helps me a lot. its very easy to useit takes off make up quickly and without scrubbing. it's gentle and not irritating. it also smells nice. though it's kind of expensive it's a good product. ",positive
" the emotionally healing benefits of orange oil and lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this to your scalp. if you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product then you can truly relax. if applying this yourself it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. you will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. the essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. you may find you need less conditioner when using this product. many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where i first found out about this product. i bought my first bottle the day i had the massage. i was that impressed and i keep buying this product. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" i use this everyother day before shampooing. my hair is much less greasy after using it!! i've also noticed that my hair seems to have more body at the roots. it also has a very pleasant orange/citrus scent. this product is worth every cent. i definitely recommend it for those with oily scalps and thinning hair ",positive
" this is a must must must i love this kit all of the items included are awesome a must have you will probly not be disappointed gives the best smokey eye loo ",positive
" for those bored with the same old bottles of shampoo an hair products at their local drugstore this is a fun new way of washing their hair with no chemicals and natural botanicals that truly do wonders and enhance every single hair. this solid shampoo bar works wonderfully; i had my doubts just like everyone else and was worried that this would remove the build up but leave the hair overly squeaky clean and stripped and if it would later at all. to my surprise this small disc turns into an avalanche of bubbles once i wet it and rub it between the hands. i also wet my hair and rub the bar all over working with the lather form my hands and the lather from the wet bar. i have to admit that this produces more lather than liquid shampoos and washes the hair without leaving it feeling like it was tortured instead its slippery and wonderfully light. afterwards i follow with the american cream conditioner (probably the best hair scented product in the universe) also from lush for a head of hair that feels rich and buttery soft with a fresh light fragrance that lingers on. the scent itself is wonderful citrusy and earthy with patchouli oil orange oil lavendin oil pine oil lemongrass oil elemi oil gardenia extract and the roman chamomile flower. i often find that all the oils and rich botanicals nourish the hair and leave it feeling happy organic and natural products have been of high interest to me lately because of the results they deliver for bouncy hair and supple skin. after using drugstore and even expansive brands of hair products and skin potions i find that my skin and hair never really benefited from all those preservatives and unnatural products derived from mineral oils and god knows what else. lush and burt's bees jason and the body shop made me change my mind and seek out products that are as good as they smell and that truly transform me from a sleepy duckling in the morning to a happy princess by the time my morning routine is over. - kasia s. ",positive
" i just got out of the shower a minute ago and i must say this is the best shampoo i've ever bought. my scalp hasn't felt this clean and fresh in a long time. washing my super-thick and waist length hair didn't feel like a chore for once and i actually look forward to my next washing. the smell reminds me of the hippie shops on haight street in san francisco. i love it ",positive
" for a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is mac. lipglass feels good on your lips as if it contained some emollients. and (this is a big and) it's not tacky or sticky. the colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood occasion and skin tone. they range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. another plus (and this is a big plus following the big and) mac lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. try adding a lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. enjoy!

" for the price this product is great - the bubbles were thick and rich and lasted a long time. the scent was light and fragrant not over-powering like some other products. for those who love their bubble baths - highly recommended ",positive
" i've been pleased with both the quantity and quality of the bubbles but the scent fades rather quickly. if the scent lasted longer it would be much improved ",positive
" i received this a a gift for valentine's day this year. it's a nice bubble bath with lots of foam (rather than big double bubbles). it's chock full of natural ingredients and no sls so it's very gentle- even for little ones. i do however prefer the deep steep in the calming lavender chamomile or energizing rosemary mint. ",positive
" i love the scent of the grapefruit-bergamot bubble bath. this combination is suitable for men or women. deep steep products are really first rate. the foot scrub and lotions are well worth the money ",positive
" i bought this but the perfume side was a clear color not purple colored and there is no color in the lip gloss it's ust glittery but i love i ",positive
" i used to sell iman when it was in a major department store. this stuff would fly off the shelves. too bad it was hardly ever in stock which made many customers go to something else. i stuck with it for 10 years now and would not dare use anything else! buy it - you will not be disappointed ",positive
" i have been using i-man line of products for the past 5 years and have been a very happy customer. this is my first time shopping for i-man makeup online and i realize that amazon.com has it for half price. this is a fantastic deal and the product is beautiful for all skin tone. my friends comment that i look flawless.

" knowing how i love everything pink a dear friend of mine gave this to me as a present. i love the scent it's not overpowering but has that lovely and alluring smell. it's so fragrant and i feel like i'm forever in a garden full of freshly-bloom beautiful pink roses. one of the simple pleasures in life - truly pink by vera wang. leave a scent of you behind. wholeheartedly recommended.

" for a guy who never paid attention to the face cream he used i found h2o plus to be amazing stuff. non-greasy no heavy scents -- it's worth every penny ",positive
" face oasis isn't like any other moisturizer i've tried - one application makes my skin appear plump and well-hydrated even if i've neglected to drink my 8 glasses of water that day. it isn't at all greasy absorbs quickly and serves as a great base over which to apply my makeup. the guys i've introduced it to have raved about it as well! ",positive
" i have thick in-between wavy and straight hair that is also dry and frizzy. other curl enhancing lotions i have tried have made my hair feel crunchy hard and sticky yuck! not this one. after i wash and condition my hair i apply this spray to almost dry hair scrunch it and let it air dry. it gives my otherwise limp frizzy waves definition lift and bounce. it even adds shine and smells great sort of like watermelon. it also looks more natural and is much easier than having to use a curling iron. the spray is easy to use and you can't really use too much of it which is a problem i've had with other products. in between washes i just spray my hair with water and scrunch it to reactivate the waves. ",positive
" i always liked the way my hair looks after a swim in the ocean and drying in the sea breeze. unfortunately i couldn't do that every day but now i can get the look with fekkai's wave creating spray. the underneath part of my hair has some natural curl and waves. i spray it on damp hair scrunch and air dry and although it doesn't dry in a toussle of renaisannce waves and perfect (bong!) ringlets it really amps up the curls and waves and gives me that beachy look. there' not a crunch factor either although if you keep spraying it on dry brushed out hair the hair can tend to get dryed out. it does add spring and holds well. i don't know how it would work on very straight hair since the top part of my hair doesn't want to respond much. but it works nicely on enhancing what mother nature gave you. ",positive
" so i was a little suspicious of this product at first; eye creams seem to be the most benign things on the market. when the beauty consultant put this on my face i let her just to be obliging not really expecting anything. we continued to talk about her products and i realized that i was feeling burning under my eyes (not painful just noticeable) and she said :see look it is working already! i looked and saw nothing but it felt good and she was kinda high pressure so i bought it. when i got to the car and looked at myself i could see a definite improvement. the skin under my eyes was tighter it was still dark under my eye but without all the baggage it was much improved. so i think that if i use this product and put my concealer on over it i am going to notice a huge difference. highly recommended ",positive
" i'm so happy that this product finally made its way here in the states. i was introduced to this particular brand a few years ago by a friend when i went to visit her in osaka and i've been hooked since. i'm one of those unfortunate few who for some reason or the other always end up with panda eyes at the end of the day due to mascara run-off. i've tried everything from cheap to expensive and from regular to waterproof mascaras to no avail. somehow though this mascara because of the unique properties of the fibers will not smudge on the skin no matter how humid or wet the day is. the cool thing about it is that if you rub your eyes the fiber will fall but not stain the skin thus eliminating the panda eye effect. the fibers will coat the eyelashes and dry up forming a sort of tube around the lashes and are surprisingly easy to clean at the end of the day no special solutions needed. when you clean your eyelashes you can actually see the fibers loosen up and leave your lashes without any residue. i am also a contact lens wearer and this product unlike many other mascaras doesn't irritate my eyes and lasts practically forever. this has to be the best mascara i have used yet and that is saying something. even the expensive department store and specialty mascaras pale next to this. and i even bought it at a local japanese drugstore! never leave home without it; it's possibly the last mascara you'll ever need ",positive
" i was a bit weary at trying a shampoo bar but as soon as i took a whiff of this little hockey-puck of sunshine i was sold. the scent is strong - so watch out if strong florals give you headaches - so strong in fact i can smell the jasmine and honeysuckle wafting out of the shower at this very moment. when i had it in the bag fresh from purchase it scented the entire living room! the conditioning agent isn't enough for people who use deep conditioners - i recommend following up the shampooing with a seperate conditioner. but the fragrance and ease of rubbing a bit of soap onto wet hair achieving masses of luscious lather a quick rinse and go - priceless! this is definately a little gem that everyone should try ",positive
" i work retail so i'm on my feet for hours at a time. throughout the day my feet sweat (yes gross i know... but there's no smell) so gave lush's t for toes a try. i noticed a huge difference the first time i tried it. for my whole shift i wasn't able to feel any moisture on my feet at all!! my feet and toes felt as fresh as it did when i first started work. the dusting powder is made with real tea tree oil so it works as an antibacterial agent as well. it's supposed to handle stinky feet as well and my boyfriend swears by it. he works construction and uses it everyday and loves it because it's not girly smelling and even the packaging is not girly so he doesn't mind leaving it at work. t for toes is a wonderful product and you only need to use a real little bit ",positive
" like most others i fell for all the hype that convinced me that every couple of years i had to buy the latest greatest design in razors. with each new design the blades got more and more expensive until i realized that it was just a gimmick to get more of my hard earned money. about a year ago i bought a merkur razor and have not regretted it. if you are a newbie to this type of razor you may want to start off slow and make minor changes to your technique. then enjoy your smooth shave and think about what to do with the extra money in your pocket ",positive
" i have hard facial hairs (thanks dad!!) and after being gilette user (last used mac 3) i finally decided to go back to classic style of shaving with double edge (de) razor and blades. merkur are the first ones i have used after the multi-edge blades and after 4-5 shaves i am getting closer shaves (w/ no irritation) than by using mutli-edge ones. also to get better results i would recommend a badger brush which really softens the skin before these de blades with a good heavy razor (merkur is a good one) can smoothly get your facial stubs. good luck ! ",positive
" this is the second time i have ordered these blades for my husband. he has a very heavy beard and says these are the only razor blades he's ever used that last anywhere near this long regular blades dull almost right away (sorry he's not here or i'd ask for the details from him i don't know how long a long time is) but at 50 he's tried a lot of blades! he says never buy him anything else again so i guess these are the best!!! ",positive
" with the advent of those truly ridiculous multiblade shaving systems (oh no--not razors; they're shaving systems. feh.) merkur blades are a welcome standby. they can be had by the full case (20 10-blade packs) for about $80 or $90. and at about a week per blade even with two-pass shaving (once with the grain of the beard and once against it) that's enough for a few years. i've been using merkur blades for almost 25 years and for overall quality and value i'd say they're the best around. i've found them best when teamed with the merkur progress adjustable razor. using both correctly furnishes the best shave next to a straight razor and without all of the trouble (well enjoyment for the straight razor aficiandoes) inherent in that practice.

" this luxurious milky creamy and rich cream smells like an island made of coconuts not overly sweet but luscious and truly indulgent it pours out and can be used with scrubbing gloves ( also sold by the body shop) or simply on it's own to envelop the skin in a coat of soft cleansing lather. this product has actual coconut oil which i also use on it's own my boss who is a gorgeous indian woman gets me coconut oil from her local supermarket and she told me to heat it up in the microwave for 15 seconds and then apply to dry hair massaging into the scalp and letting it sit as long as i can before shampooing out twice to find my hair shiny and luxuriously full of volume and softness. the same oil is really amazing on the skin not only does it smell like coconut milk with powdered milk mixed together but is wonderful on dry winter days when my skin wants to turn red and be irritated. fabulously creamy and comforting this indulgent cream settles me in for a cozy and warm night because there's nothing better than a warm shower with a great product that makes me want to jump into a clean fuzzy bed and dream of sweet things. - kasia s.

" this product is awesome; nice texture great tingling feeling and very smooth/clean feeling after use. but i'm not sure if you should use it daily as exfoliators should only be used 2-3x/week because they're too abrasive. so just remember that. otherwise this is definitley a top notch exfoliator.

" the 2nd day i shampoo-d with this bar it was amazing the compliments i received. it made my hair right after going to the salon shiny. i'd highly reccomend this to anyone ",positive
" i wasn't so sure about the claims that this shampoo bar would make my hair super shiny but i didn't really care either way because it smells very nice and i just like relaxing while i try to wake up (or wind down) in the shower. anyway it did make a difference! my hair has been noticeable shinier while using this stuff though i would try lush's big shampoo if you want to see an even bigger difference. perfect format for brining with you to the gym or travelling - nothing to spill! make sure you get one of the little travel tins to bring with you so it doesn't soap everything in your gym/travel bag :) my only complaint is that it only lasted about a week for me. i have medium-long hair and didn't use that much. i haven't tried my other shampoo bar yet so i don't know if that's more of a problem just for this particular bar or if it's a problem across the board. read the reviews and find out! ",positive
" like all lush shampoo cakes it does a great job in cleaning hair and is nice and sudsy. i find the smell to be nothing to write home about. yes my hair was shiny but it tends to be with all of their products. don't be scared of the glitter though it's barely there.....all in all i prefer new and karma komba to this one. ",positive
" during the winter months i have flaky skin under my beard and on my face. this product has prevented that problem the last 3 winters that i've used it. i'd recomend for that use. i don't think it has much of a scent at all. certainly not like most soaps and skin care products. ",positive
" this is a wonderful addition to taking a bath! the size is very nice quite large and makes for an awesome spa like exprerience in your own home! the sponge is clean and has no smell. rinses out easily! highly recommend ",positive
" when i ordered i didnt read the word double...so when i got it n put it on it was pretty thick and i was like whooa..but its good stuff just heavy for me so im ordering a regular one now ",positive
" as someone who really dislikes making up but needs a bit of cover in her face powder i have found clinique's superpowder to be just the right product. i have been using it for nearly ten years. in between superpowder purchases i have tried other lesser brands and have always returned to this product. it is truly no muss no fuss. no foundation or concealers just a nice simple matte powder that sets in naturally. no powdery bits sitting on the skin surface no flaking ... and stays on all day with nary a touch up ... just perfect ",positive
" this cologne smells great. a guy i know wears it and whenever he hugs me i smell this and well he smells fantastic. in fact the way he smelled was one of the first things that interested me in him. i'm a big fan of the original curve cologne which smells really nice as well...boys/men can't go wrong wearing either of them ",positive
" i've heard lots of stories about people using beer on their hair and i will admit to trying it once. cynthia sylvia stout is a much more pleasant experience with beer blended with fresh lemon juice cognac oil and lemon oil. it looks a little like a chocolate syrup and i didn't think it had a very strong beer scent. strangely enough the scent sort of reminds me of freshly made whole wheat yeast dough (perhaps with a hint of lemon zest) which is currently baking in my bread baker. this is a very cleansing shampoo that you might want to use when your hair is misbehaving and needs a little shine and control. you may only need to shampoo once since this really cleans well the first time. using this with the veganese conditioner will leave your hair feeling super clean and not overly conditioned. if you want a deeper conditioning experience try american cream conditioner which is simply intoxicating. please don't make me live without it! while i enjoyed using cynthia sylvia stout shampoo i still think my first love is rehab shampoo (the scent of rehab is divine). this shampoo did make my hair feel silky and soft so i'll definitely buy it again. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" i am a big lush fan - but cynthia sylvia stout shampoo is my favorite product! it does smell very strongly of beer when you use it so if you have an aversion to that smell you won't like this. at first i didn't like the smell but now i think it's sort of a nice wake up. i don't smell it on my hair when it's dry as other reviewers have noticed - although i use (non-lush) conditioner afterwards so maybe that tends to wash the smell away? this shampoo makes my hair so shiny. i have long blonde hair and it really makes it glow like nothing else. i don't know how it does it...but people will literally come up to me and comment on how nice and shiny my hair looks on the days i use this product! oh and this shampoo is very concentrated - a little goes a long way. so think of it as though you're getting twice as much when factoring the price in. it's still expensive but i think it's a great product when you need a little splurge ",positive
" this shampoo totally fulfilled its promise of bright shiny hair for me. i have nice hair to begin with (if i do say so myself) but i used this in conjunction with one of lush's conditioners(american cream)and my friends told me i had shampoo model hair that day. i'm not crazy about the beer-ish smellwhich is why i'll give it a four rating.however it doesn't seem to be very strong once you wash it out and the benefit is worth it ",positive
" i have terrible skin lots of scars stretch marks burns bruises acne etc. but people always come up to me & comment on how beautiful my skin is (due to the makeup). dermablend is way too dry(i like to mix it with a little lotion before applying) but it stays on even in water. if it looks a bit flaky/pale/ghostly put some lotion over it. any type of makeup looks bad if you don't know how to apply it. duh ",positive
" i'm a sort of sweaty type so i usually like an antiperspirant/deodorant but sometimes the antiperspirant ingredients give me a rash and it's really not practical to use them all over everywhere on every single part of your body that might get whiffy. aromarant is quick and easy to use doesn't make you itchy or rashy no matter where you use it and works so well as a deodorant that it makes you want to do an infomercial for it free of charge ",positive
" does anyone remember being told that freckles were beauty marks? do believe i was told this numerous times as i tried eveything to banish the light spray of freckles across my nose. well those nose freckles did eventually disappear but in their place came sun spots on my hands. gardening is one of my hobbies and i love to be out of doors. i know i know - wear garden gloves. for me digging in the dirt isn't enjoyable in gloved hands. hence sun spots. over a period of weeks cellex-c fade away gel has markedly faded the most obvious spots. it isn't oily so i apply the gel to the sun spots twice a day in the morning and at night. by remembering to apply sunscreen to my hands before going outside i think i'll be able to maintain the beneficial effects of this gel. - gail cook ",positive
" it smells beautiful and is very relaxing. by far my favorite out of so many i've tried! ",positive
" i recieved a couple of these while in college as a gift and have been using them ever since. up until now i have aways had a hard time finding them. i have been usinghte same two for years now and i gotta tell you washclothes come and go but these still look almost new after all these years. i am so glad i can stock up on these!! buy them you will ove them. i have ultra sensitive skin and these washclothes are outstanding for exfoliating ",positive
" i love this cleanser!!! i have combination skin and i sometimes have breakouts especially when i am stressed. this cleanser is great because it sloughs off the dead skin without irritation. i also love how it doesnt dry out my skin! and i have a lot less breakouts now and when i do its not as bad as it used to be. even if you have sensitive skin this cleanser is perfect of course there are other great cleanser options if you think this will irritate your skin. also this cleanser really helps to minimize/clean out your pores. i really noticed a difference after using it for only a week. i also recommend the perfecting lotion especially if you have slightly oily skin. i use it during the day and even at night(!)because it really improves my skin and i dont wake up with zits in the morning :)plus it saves me money since i dont have to by an acne treatment gel to put under my lotion ",positive
" lipstick going. this review is for the guava stain shade. i first bought this lipstick i believe in the mid to late eighties. i was delighted with it then and am now. it is sheer light non greasy and the color never changes. the color is not neutral but i find that i can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade i wear. i would buy different brandsdifferent shades and wear them maybe once then back to guava stain. it along with clinque's soft pressed blush in new clover orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites and the one's i reach for time and again. they are my dependables. daytime wear for sure not night this is a subtle sheer color ",positive
" i bought this for a frriend and she love it so i have to give it 5 since it was not that expensive the only problem i had was the item was not giftwrap as i pay 2.99 to have giftwrap and it wasn't. so the gift wrapping option does not work very well with the seller ",positive
" for those with dry tight and thirsty skin or perhaps for any phases and changes in the texture and comfort level of their usually good skin this is the balm of the gods as i call it. the cream comes in a slick white tube with a gold and orange stripe at the top and can be squeezed out like toothpaste as the thick metal tube lets me get to the very last bit at the end a total bonus since i hate wasting product. expensive but well worth it since dr. hauschka products are extremely natural and healing in their properties with no harsh chemicals disguised by pink dyes and fragrances. this cream smells like a pale pink bulgarian rose garden something i got to experience as a child as it makes me smile twenty years later as i used this cream. winter and high times of stress or freaky dry skin episodes are the usual scenarios that would require me to use this cream as i usually stick to my favorite green tube of cetaphil lotion as my day and night moisturizer ever since i got it from my dermatologist who did wonders to my complexion two years ago. great as a face cream and also wonderful as eye cream especially when the computer i use at work always seems to suck any moisture form my eye area right out. this patted right on top of makeup refreshes and plumps up the skin and only a tiny bit is needed. this cream lasts for months so at this price it's really a bargain considering that what i put on my face always shows up as results or neglect if the wrong product is use. - kasia s. ",positive
" subtle yet powerful! i love this scent. i actually used the entire bottle instead of using half of the bottle getting sick of it and then purchasing a new fragrance. many compliments from men & women. a little spritz does the trick! you can also purchase a sheer moisturizing body spray. perfect for daytime wear ~ especially during the summer. pricey but definately worth it!! ",positive
" ...if you don't use this stuff! after too many years of uncomfortable shaves and having to wait 2-3 days between shaving to let my raw sore neck recover i finally started to do some research into what i could add to my regimen/technique to improve results. i read numerous articles about the benefits of pre-shave oil so i decided to add this stuff to my arsenal...and i'm never going back. first off the price might be a detrement to those who are used to $3/can drug store shaving cream but a little goes a long way and this little bottle might actually last you longer than 4 or 5 cans of cream or gel. you only use a small amount each day and it spreads evenly over your whole face. when used in tandem with a good shaving cream it virtually eliminates razor burn and uncomfortable shaving. my razor glides over my face each morning now. if you look at your razor each morning with disgust like i used to give this stuff a shot. i guarantee you won't be disappointed. try their shaving cream and old school shaving brush as well. pamper your face...this is how shaving was supposed to be before cheap aerosol shaving cream and disposable plastic razors started ripping our faces to shreds ",positive
" i am actually an employee for l'occitane (pronounced lox-ee-tahn; that's the question i get asked every day! lol). i have only been working for the company at their santa barbara store for about 2 weeks and this is what i've learned about the artemesia shampoo: this is the shampoo that all four season's carry. the packageing may seem different if you were at a four season's in another country but this is the only shampoo of ours that they carry (once in a while people dont believe me but trust me- they train us on which one it is). people come in everyday for this shampoo because they loved it so much at the four seasons. in fact the company sold out and our store (which ran out quickly because there is a four seasons in santa barbara) had many unhappy customers because they couldnt find it. the scent is heavenly and lasting on your hair. some other products you might want to try out? the four seasons also carrys our verbena shea soap verbena body lotion and our lavender linen water (which makes clothes smell great when used in ironing). also just to let you know this week we're getting new products for our honey line (btw- try the honey body balm- i'm hooked) including a cleanser milk bath and honey massage nectar. hope this information helps some of you- enjoy!

" so i've been wanting this particular fragrance for a long time now and my boyfriend finally purchased it for me for christmas. it arrived on time with no problems and also came along with various perfume samples. what can i say? it was exactly i expected to be. no disappointments ",positive
" i bought this conditioner for my daughter's hair. the smell is wonderful!!! plus the product works great!!! it now comes with a pump at least mine did which makes it easy to use. it leaves my aa daughter's hair soft and managable ",positive
" i really like this product. because i have a natural do products that are too heavy don't work. this is perfect for my hair. it makes it easier to style and it leaves my hair soft and smelling good ",positive
" i have tried many different products and this one is the best. i rely on it for many years already and it always works faster than anything else i have tried. four stars because it leaves a thin barely but visible film on the skin where you apply it. you can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem. especially if under makeup ",positive
" i use this on the ocasional hormonal breakout and it is super. it is easy to apply goes on clear and is very powerful. it works to clear up that spot in record time. i'd highly recommend it ",positive
" although i find this soap a bit sweet (almost bubble gum sweet) my daughter (teen) loves it. all little girls would love this especially with the glitter stars and random colors. we get it often the bathroom smells nice after a shower too ",positive
" powdered eye shadows have not been high on my list of must-haves primarily because they tended to crease in a few hours and looked a bit artificial. what a happy surprise to find paula dorf's eye color glimmer that comes in powder form but is actually creamy so that it goes on smoothly and does not crease. her line of glimmer shadows have a hint of gold in them - not too much but just enough for a sun kissed effect. another plus for these glimmer shadows is that they can also be used to contour or line. for lining simply use a moistened eye liner brush. there's a lovely palette of shades to choose from depending upon day or dramatic evening wear. nymph is an appealing innocent blue while hypnotic is ready for a night on the town ",positive
" what a great modern selection of elegant colors and what a perfectly textured eye shadow. paula dorf says where are the brights? not here and calls the shadows softly muted. that is true but don't take that to mean there is no life to this shadow. it's also named glimmer and it does have a slight velvety glimmer to it. the selection of very wearable colors has a shade for everyone. i bought the gold which is subtle but is still gold. i love the way it goes on and it's suitable for day or night. paula dorf will never have you looking like a clown but i don't find these shades boring either. ",positive
" i absolutely love this chanel foundation. it is lightweight and yet provides fair to good coverage. i like this foundation because it does not feel heavy and it is water-based. it can be worn in the daytime or evening. use with chanel loose powder and chanel concealer for a perfectly flawless finish ",positive
" for a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is mac. lipglass feels good on your lips as if it contained some emollients. and (this is a big and) it's not tacky or sticky. the colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood occasion and skin tone. they range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. another plus (and this is a big plus following the big and) mac lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. try adding a lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. enjoy!

" due to the ravages of 60 years worth of gravity nursing babies and losing a lot of weight the girls need a little help. (actually they need a lot of help but we won't go there!) i have worn bra inserts from the fabric store the ones that kind of remind you of a shoulder pad. they do the job but create a line across the bra cup and have to constantly be adjusted during the day. i love the silicone inserts. iinserted in your bra they look like the real deal and since they cling to your skin they stay in place all day. i call them my ex-plants! love 'em!

" i have tried so many products out there to firm up the area under my eyes and nothing has worked. initially i was a little skeptical cause of my lack of success with other products. i have to say i was very pleasantly surprised. it certainly has improved the look of the skin around my eyes. it may seem expensive but a little goes a very very long way. has a nice texture and easily absorbs and not the least big irritating...and i have sensitive skin. try it...i don't think you'll be disappointed. i wasn't ",positive
" if you need something to get you going in the morning shock therapy will do it. we're talking major minty shower gel here--your skin will be tingling. the smell clears the mind and gets the blood flowing to the brain. a gift note: this would be a good gift for someone who doesn't like flowery bath products; even guys would like this ",positive
" i use this constantly - i've bought every limited edition of the set that shows up at sephora. i don't blend it in though i dab a line across my top eyelid and let it dry. not too much but it's still so vibrant that a little goes a long way. i've reccomended this to everyone ",positive
" this concealer comes in a pencil form so it is very precise and offers very good coverage. it stays on well. it is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers so you can put it in a small precise spot and it will actually stay there. i have tried many concealers for small blemishes and this is my favorite. it comes in enough shades so you can find a good match which is important ",positive
" i was worried about buying this kit because of the cost but it's worth every penny. in less than a week my feet have gone from cracked and peeling to soft and healthy. this kit is amazing ",positive
" my boyfriend always got ingrown hair on his neck and he was very skeptical about using this. now he doesn't get any ingrown hairs and he doesn't pick at them anymore. he will not live without it now and we both recommend it! ",positive
" tend skin was introduced to me for after waxing ingrown hairs. but she said the secret was that it stopped itching from mosquito bites and within 24 hrs any pimple and just blooming pimple are gone!!! i introduced this to friends at work and now everyone uses it. we all have clearer skin when nothing else ( even pro-active) didn't work ",positive
" i don't know why nobody else likes this product but so far it's the only one that works for my ingrown facial hairs.. yes it stings a bit when i put it on but it quickly goes away. it doesn't dry my skin out it actually helps get rid of the dry white-looking flaky skin after i shave. i used to get ingrown hairs so bad on my face that they would be there for months. eventually i'd get to the point of having to do my own surgery with a needle to try and extract the hair. if i get an ingrown hair now i just use tend skin once in the morning and once before bed and it actually extracts the hair on it's own! it gets rid of the redness and swelling also associated with ingrown hairs. for the only time in my life my face actually looks clear and tend skin is the product that has done it for me. before i finish i'd just like to add that i'm the kind of person that nothing ever works on. any product i try never does as advertised. whether it be shampoo deodorant medication etc. tend skin is one of the rarities that actually does work for me. and believe me i've tried a lot of products for ingrown hairs ",positive
" the scent is so unforgettable fresh and sexy and sweet and... it's just the best among the best ",positive
" this is a 'must have' fragrance. it has an exotic scent that will have everyone around you asking what perfume do you have on?. it can be worn day or night. the entire burberry line is fantastic ",positive
" i'm sooo happy with all 3 of these scents. the candy apple is definitely the most accurate and i'd sell my soul if i could only continue buying it on its own. but the other 2 are good too. the cotton candy is awesome but not 100% on accuracy and the cherry sno-cone makes me start slobbering when i smell it. highly recommended ",positive
" this stuff is awesome if you have dry coarse or damaged hair. this is lush creamy and lathers up well. this is a wonderful luxury shampoo. you will feel like a queen/star when you wash your hair with this. the smells is fresh and yummy. i love using this stuff except i cannot use this every day as it will weigh my hair down. my hair is fine and straight and has some natural wave in the back. i highly recommend this product and will buy it again ",positive
" i originally wanted the black ginger aromatic candle but after reading the reviews it seemed that the red currant is the all around favorite. the smell is nice but i think i expected something a bit different. the candle's scent does travel throughout my home like others have stated and it seems to be burning slowly. the candle itself is fine quality and comes packaged nicely! if i found a scent that i liked a bit better i would be 100% pleased ",positive
" i received the soku lime candle as a gift and was so thrilled! the box itself is decorative and i re-used it as a pencil holder on my desk. the scent is very aromatic and long lasting. i had relatives over and they remarked on the scent as soon as they entered my house. i was very pleased.

" this candle is the ultimate pleasure! it's smell is not over powering but is pleasurable at the same time. you will be sure to love it as much as i do! ",positive
" i have tried every shampoo and conditioner on the market and was dissatisfied with the results until trying this combo. my curls are well formed and bouncy and i use less styling product. plus this line smells great! it has a light citrusy smell that i wish they'd bottle into perfume. i even got my boyfriend (who has curly hair like mine) to buy and use these products by letting him sample mine. i am hooked ",positive
" when i was a little girl i would watch my mother take her makeup off at her dressing table. cold cream and soft cloth tissues. a gentle misting of water and then another dabbing with cloth. then night cream eye cream (dab on gently never rub) a special lotion for her throat and collarbone area. she would impart her beauty secrets to me while i sat transfixed. although i was convinced that she was the most beautiful woman in the world i was surprised that with all these lotions and oils she didn't' slide right out of bed at night. exercise sweetheart. drink lots of water. never go to sleep in your makeup--no matter how tired you are. never wash your face with regular soap. moisturize moisturize moisturize. your skin has to last you a lifetime and nothing gives away a woman's age like uncared for skin. while i am not sure where i would even find 'cold cream' today i follow the vast majority of her regimen. the two items that i use for under my eyes are avon's repair eye serum and hydrofirming bio6 eye cream. the cream plumps up and firms the delicate tissue around the eye and the serum smoothes and moisturizes the skin. i consider avon products to be the unsung work horses of the beauty industry. they almost always do exactly what they say they are going to do and at a very modest price. expensive boutique and department store products rarely do a better job and are usually exorbitantly overpriced. when you factor in that avon products go on sale regularly (which is when i usually stock up) you are getting an even better deal for your money. while i am not a complete cheapskate i love a bargain and i want to feel like i am getting full value for my money. the skin around the eyes is quite thin and delicate so i think if you follow my mother's advice and dab on gently never rub avon's repair eye serum and hydrofirming bio6 eye cream you will be able to keep this area smooth without being greasy even with the most drying of climatic conditions ",positive
" i've been using avon products since i was a teen. i started using the eye serum a couple of years ago after avon discontinued their wonderful eye gel. i will be 60 this year and have no wrinkles around my eyes and few on my face either though i am a dry-skinned redhead. contrary to what someone else here said i find that it does absorb very quickly. i buy it because it is not oily--oily makeup around my eyes makes my eyes burn and this gives me no problems at all. also i have sensitive skin so i have to use hypoallergenic makeup. this fills that bill too. try it!! it's great!! ",positive
" i agree with the reviewer who likened it to actual lemon juice. it is very strong and i realized after spraying it twice it only needed once... most likely because it is an eau de parfum and not eau de toilette. very much worth the money. i was complimented on it the entire day. it does not resemble lemon pledge to me at all ",positive
" i tried the lemon sugar perfume and i am absolutly in love with it. it is like no other perfume i have ever smelled before. i will probably be using it the rest of my life i hope they never stop making it. i think everyone should try it. the scent is lemony and sugar just like it says. it is light and last a very long time. i am already going to order a bigger bottle tomorrow. do not just take my world for it order it today and experience something great and new ",positive
" i could never expect to like a lemon scented perfumebut this one is definately different. when i first smelt it in the bottle i thought:ohno!dish soap!but when i put it on i immediately loved it. on me it smells like lemon scented candy.it's so fresh and clean!i couldn't stop smelling my wrist!and everytime i smelt it i felt as if i were in a wet garden and lemon blossoms were falling on my skin! it was a nice alternative to all my candy scented perfumes. it lasts a long time too and it's affordableplus it smells like spring! the best choise to welcome the hot days of the summersince it will keep you fresh and cool. a must buy! ",positive
" this fragrance smells great. if you have used the awesome fresh lemon sugar shower gel it smells exactly the same. it smells much better than the other sugar fragrance that has been around a long time. this one is clean and fresh and uplifting ",positive
" this is a very lemony smell and the sugar takes away the sour 'edge' of the lemon. it is simply only that-lemon and sugar then it gets warmer and airy throughout the day.if you want to just try it get a sample size one from ebay or a mini perfumes website.if your considering the more expensive clean fragrance but aren't sure about the price fresh lemon sugar is similar in scent the only thing being left out is the laundry 'air' fragrance ",positive
" not your typical thick floral-smelling perfume this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises--like lemon juice mixed with sugar. it's a seasonal perfume (i can't imagine smelling like lemons in the winter). it smells very crisp fresh and clean which i enjoy a lot but i imagine others would not; the same things i like about this perfume could smell like a cleaning product to others. go to your fridge. get a lemmon squeeze its juice out into a cup and add some sugar. if you enjoy the smell you get buy this perfume--i highly recommend it. if not stick to something more traditional and vanilla/floral like ana sui's dolly girl ",positive
" i am in love with this product. it smells wonderful once you put it on and it really seems to relax sore muscles. the only problem i have with it is i go through it too fast (i probably use more than i need to). ",positive
" i buy these in bulk and have done since my darling sister in law gifted me with a boxful of lush goodies some years back. i have terrible circulation. i get cold and stay that way. from time to time i'm also an insomniac. the wiccy massage bar has a cure for both. the cinnamon leaf is very warming on the skin and the aduki beans seem to help this warmth penetrate. (they also fall all over the floor if you're not careful...but you wont care..the bar is that good). the oil is thick and lovely - but be careful about rubbing up against anything it may stain. this is one of the reasons i only ever use it before bedtime. who cares if it messes up the cartman flannel pajama bottoms? speaking of bedtime...i'm not sure what it is..whether it's the cinnamon or the other essential oils i can't name but they have a very calming effect. much better than yucky smelling lavender. helps me get to sleep in no time flat. i rub it on the back of my neck and sometimes even on the underside of my pillow case for this soft comfy shut eye ",positive
" after a long day of hunching over my computer at work for 8+ hours and a brutal workout after i came home tonight and enjoyed the best shower experience i have ever had by myself with a bath bar! :) the cooling sensation of the wiccy magic muscles bar the cool air in the bathroom mixed with the warm water of the shower made for a incredibly relaxing blissful enjoyable shower. i feel great! i'll sleep great tonight! this experience has made me a lush customer for life ",positive
" i havent gotten the treatment myself yet but my husband loves it. dont rub it on too long or you'll have too much. it melts quickly when it touches skin. i love the peppermint/cinnamon mixture scent and he likes the heat it provides. it leaves a coating of the buttery stuff on your skin so wear a shirt to bed so it can soak in and moisturize ",positive
" i bought this after using other murad products and loving them. i like this but i wouldn't say i love it. first it's a bit overpriced. i can get a comparable drugstore product for a fraction of the price. the toner itself is decent but doesn't seem to clean as deeply as other toners. however for those who find toners to be a bit harsh this may be a good option. non-drying and doesn't have that toner burn. overall a decent product but not one i am sure i would re-purchase ",positive
" so glad to find this hard to find item..! i have tried every kind of polish dryer.. but it did the surface and left a tacky mess underneath . for years.. i have used dry and shine with the great success.. it goes on like lotion... drys to a haze and you buff it off to a beautiful hard shine...and... dry nails.. i love it!!! it is magic!!!! ",positive
" a clean and refreshing scent. not heavy at all - its top notes are citrus based and this is appropriate for day or night wear. it is one of my favorites. it reminds me a little of happy for women which i love but don't wear because of its distinctly feminine smell. cudos to clinique. happy is a terrific man's cologne it smells clean but not like laundry soap ( which too many men's colognes smell like these days ) ",positive
" i have ordered a few of these as gifts and the recipients are always delighted. responses i have heard about the products are marvelous! heavenly! and to die for!... and keep in mind that these are ladies who take there bath times seriously!!! the range of flavors makes it easy to give this gift again and again. the order always comes pre-wrapped suitable for gift giving. you can't go wrong with giving this as a gift. i give this seller my highest recommendation! kudos ",positive

" my skin was winter dry and i expected this product to have richer moisturizing qualities. the scent is nice but quite strong. not a 5-star product as i usually get at body shop but works fine for more balanced skin ",positive
" i love this scent. it smells warm and spicy on my skin. the eau de parfum is strong but not overpowering at all and the dry down is wonderful. it also lasts all day long which is great because i'm a spray it and forget it kinda gal. ",positive
" this fragrance is both sexy and playful. it truly embodies the essence of a woman. both men and women find it to be a truly amazing scent ",positive
" these candles smell true to their names make the room smell nice but aren't overpowering. they do smell good when you burn more than one scent too ",positive
" i light this candle every other day in my bedroom because i enjoy this scent so much. it is a very light scent but the smell does fill a room quickly. if you like the amazing grace and pure grace lines from philosophy you will like the clean crisp white candle. the candle is high quality and comes in a very nice container that i didn't want to throw away. great for gifts ",positive
" know you. you were me. looking for what seemed to be a simple thing - a scented candle that actually smells up the room when you light it. you've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of well grocery store. and some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. so then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. they are not candles my friend. they are sculptures. some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. this is when you lose your patience. i do not want crispy dried flowers. i want a candle that pumps a good scent all over a room when i light it. this is it. votivo. you will walk into the room and that room will smell like the candle. the most universally loved scent is probably red currant. i also enjoy rain. the little glass it comes in makes a cute vase after the candle is done. plus they make perfect last minute hostess gifts as the box is very nice and expensive-looking. so votivo isn't the cheapest candle in the world. they're still cheaper than buying a bunch of cheap candles that stink...weakly stink.

" tweezerman tweezers are by far the best tweezers i've ever purchased. they stay sharp for an incredibly long time making tweezing precise quick and virtually painless. and when they do go dull all you have to do is send them in for a free sharpening and in a week or so they arrive back good as new. you can't beat that! ",positive
" i'm sure that you don't need any more assurance but just to let you know i've had my tweezerman's for over 5 years now. they are still sharp! plus if you ever were to drop them they probably wouldn't be significantly damaged. these tweezers are a must have. ",positive
" tweezerman tweezers are simply put - the best - with capital letters! i bought my first pair at bed bath & beyond 2 years ago and i just now broke down to buy another pair because i couldn't even go without them long enough to send them in to be sharpened for free! i tell all my friends (and after one use of mine they agree) that once you use a tweezerman you realize that no other tweezers out there even come close to their quality or how well they work. i have had to fight them out of the clenched fists of quite a few of my friends who have wanted to borrow them. how many times do you make rules for a pair of tweezers? my number one rule? you can use them but not take them out of my presence!! definitely worth the money - in spades!

" the pictures posted here of the paul & joe blotting paper compact don't do it justice. the compact is very beautiful large and all covered in a pretty flower-patterned material. very feminine very stylish very pretty. my only complaint? i wish it had a snap or something so it'd stay closed instead of only folding... the price is a bit steep at first but fortunately they did consider refills at an affordable price. in my experience i haven't found different brands of blotting paper to be very different amongst themselves and this is no exception it gets the job done adequately only in a prettier package... as far as blotting goes this one blots shine like it should but get it for the stylish case and the convenience of affordable refills ",positive
" i got this as a gift from my mother last year. this product saved my hands and feet! it helped them stay soft. no more itchy ankles or knuckles. i preferred to use this at night but i do use it on my feet almost everyday before i put my socks on for the day. it moisturizes without too heavy of a feeling ",positive
" i like this lotion it is moisturizing/retexturing but sort of waxy hence the 4 stars but it is still good stuf ",positive
" very moisturizing and smells nice too. the sea minerals and exfoliating ingredients keep my cuticles looking good and help cut down on hangnails too. i apply lots of it at bedtime ",positive
" i love this fragance. it's my favorite. no matter where i go if i am wearing this perfume i always get compliments. it has a very floral sort of sultry scent to it. i love it ",positive
" givenchy's very irresistible is magnificent! floral yet spicy overtones with a touch of black current in a rose peony base. better than bob mackie's perhaps perfume. and infinitely complex so that the scent is never tiresome. irresistible lasts all day and is a fragrance that captivates. this perfume is different than the typical scents that arrive on the market and well worth a try! ",positive
" love love love this scent. i have received many compliments about it. long lasting and definitely addictive. i think its more of a late-fall and winter scent if i do say so myself ",positive
" this product is perfect for dreadlocks.i buy it whenever i am in the us. i live in the caribbean and even in the extreme heat this stuff is the best for my hair type. ",positive
" i have shoulder length natural dredlocs and while this didn't lock my hair it did smooth out the flyaways around the crown of my head. it also has a great light scent that doesn't compete with the other hair care products i use like the vanila leave-in conditioner and the hair butter ",positive
" this stuff is sooo great. this three-pack set gives you the creme de la creme in men's skincare. the shampoo is wonderful and actually prevent hair loss. the body wash is my favorite...its smells awesome. the after shave is fantastic...soothing and refreshing. i suggest this pack for those who've never used billy jealousy or those loyal followers such as myself...this is also a great was for someone to get introduced to billy jealousy this has all the essentials. you will not be displeased in fact you'll be in awe...you'll be compelled to tell everyone this also makes a great gift. billy jealousy is the absolute best and i've used all upscale lines from department stores sephora and spas...and this stuff is the best ",positive
" it smells good and made me hair relly soft. it did lighten it a little bit but i also used the blonde with it. after a while i think my hair will get even lighter. highly recommended ",positive
" i love this conditioner! it smells divine and it made my hair feel like silk! my hair is ash blonde and i noticed a very slight lift in colour. regardless i recommend this product highly especially for dry damged hair. i recommend this product in conjunction with new! (hair) solid shampoo bar also made by lush cosmetics ",positive
" i've had my marilyn hair treatment for some 3 months and it makes my hair smell great! kind of like a smooth scent in my hair. it didn't really lighten my hair but it smells great and it did add some extra softness to it ",positive
" got this sample from a friends mom who worked for a major department store..and i loved it...but i couldn't believe it was a scent from clinique! love that it's light and has little hints of powder and citrus to it. i definitely recommend this scent...especially for the springtime. great for daytime wear ",positive
" the gel has a slight tingling sensation but it doesn't itch or burn and after using it for a few times the tingling stopped. i love this stuff!!! give it a chance it works great ",positive
" i purchased the tui shampoo and conditioner and although it is watery it lathers very well and leaves your hair squeaky clean. i wear my hair natural with no chemicals and it held my natural curls in place the entire day my hair did not dry out nor did it become poofy all day. i love carol's daughter and i am thankful for her products ",positive

" i found iman lipsticks from the kits to be not as nice as the picture but the eyeshadows are very soft with high pigments in beautiful colors; the pencils good quality and very versatile. overall the kits are a great buy ",positive
" i was so surprised by this eyeshadow. i usually buy cheap brands from the drugstore but when i tested this on my hand i had to have it! be mine is a light shimmery pink paired with a soft charcoal. pink usually looks weird on me but this shadow is so soft smooth and lightweight that it glides on and doesn't look cakey. since i bought this i hardly wear any of the cheap stuff i own. this is worth the price and now i'm saving up to buy a few more shades ",positive
" one whiff of this delicious soap and you are transported to a land of pine trees where plates of freshly sliced oranges are served on a bed of lemongrass surrounded by patchouli candles. this is the best way i can describe the scent that seems to awaken from the night and mingle with memories of exotic honey and wide-open skies. i am not sure where i go when i inhale deeply but i am no longer in the shower. follow this with the skin sin lotion and you will enter a little bit of heaven on earth. also delicious to use in a bath with sea salts and patchouli orange slices optional but you might crave the taste of oranges while using this soap. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" this is my favorite soap in the whole wide world. it makes me happy when i use it. it smells fresh like the wind the ocean grass sand. i don't know it's just the perfect scent. i have both the karma kream lotion and karma dusting powder from lush and i love them as well but the soap is still my favorite. next time i go to their store i'm going to buy the biggest brick of this stuff that i can because it's great! just a simple gylcerine-based soap with a dark orange-red hue but the smell is just so wonderful that every time i wash my hands it turns into some sort of new-age deep-breathing exercise while i try to get as much of that lovely scent into my nostrils as i can. i've found that this soap lathers better than others but you have to be careful not to leave it in the shower all the time or it will get soft and melt away with the condensation. trust me you don't want to waste any of this stuff by letting it leak into the drain while other people are using the bathroom! i leave mine out so it can make my bathroom smell really great as an added bonus :) fresh fruity citrusy with just a tiny hint of patchouli to give it an earthy note. definitely a winner from lush! as soon as i smelled this soap in their store for the first time i loved this scent. as you can tell from the reviews a lot of other people do too ",positive

" worth every penny. someone gave this red currant soap as a house warming gift and i became obsessed. i really cannot tell you how good of quality these products are. the candles burn forever and really scent the place up but not in an ovepowering fake way. i can't wait until they make body perfume in red currant. all of them smell good however. cheers from berkeley c ",positive
" ive never liked spicy or musky scents but im in love with burberry brit. its got a great musky overtone but its not too heavy like most fragrances like it. the scent sticks around all day which is also a plus. i've a;ways used light scents like romance by ralph lauren and ck one but burberry brit is easily my new favourite...im actually here to buy my second bottle.. ",positive
" this is just incredible. many subtle layers of scents non of them too strong or overpowering despite the fact that this will stay with you all day long ( no need to respray in other words so it's a great value for the price ). i had never tried a burberry product before and quite honestly bought this on a whim because i was running low on cologne ( yes i'm one of those types who has to wear something different every day ) and wanted to try something different. i am happy to say there is really nothing i can compare it too - and that's a good thing it's not samey like so many men's fragrances out today and not feminine at all. very nice. ",positive
" if you ever wondered what it would be like to wander in a field of violets then this shampoo gives a lush interpretation of what it would be like to walk through one of raymond gehman's photographs. the deep purple color is remnicent of crushed blackberries and the scent is a mingling of lemon coconut bergamot and violets. the truth is this shampoo is one of the best shampoos lush sells and i think it gives even more body and texture than rehab. use this and follow with the coolaulin conditioner for shiny bouncy hair that is scented with violets and coconut. the fragrance follows you around for hours and envelops you in a comforting warmth. this shampoo may have you dreaming about the purple haze gift box filled with violet lavender and blackcurrant items or looking into the gratuitous violets soap. to complete the experience you may want the smitten hand cream - quite luxurious and comforting. for some reason the all that jas bath item worked well with the violet scent so my house is now scented with jasmine and violets and i feel like i'm walking in fields of flowers. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" this is alittle heavier than usual summer skin products ie light and non greasy but when you are maintaining your tan and or recovering from skin peeling this cream is rich and works great! the ingredients are rich and they really make the skin feel smooth. ",positive
" this is a treat to wear i alternate it with my secret sparkling lily clear gel deodorant. the fresh deodorant doesn't dry my skin and my it rubbery feeling but it keeps me from sweating. it smells just like fresh's sugar perfume sweet and lemony but doesn't last as long that's why i only gave it 4 stars. it also doesn't cake or pill up like other deodorants. this is my favorite deodorant ",positive
" this lip gloss is so wonderful i don't know where to start. long lasting shine perfect color goes on smooth-doesn't feel sticky or gummy like some glosses do mild fruity flavor. i highly recommend this lip gloss to anyone-the expense is worth it 100x over ",positive
" i have been using this mascara for years. i have tried other brands--drugstore varieties as well as department store varieties and have been disappointed with everything else i have ever tried. why? this mascara is smooth; it does not flake off and fall into your eyes. it does not ever look clumpy. it is also easy to remove without losing any eyelashes. i would not say that this mascara will make your lashes a mile long or dangerously thick or whatever hype you hear from other brands. those kinds only ever look like clumpy mascara. just a simple nice natural looking mascara that won't irritate your eyes ",positive
" this gel-based mascara does an excellent job of creating long separate and well defined but natural lashes. if you like your mascara to have some oomph to it you would want to look elsewhere. for those who can't stand a single clump you may have found your new favorite! if you've ever gotten a mascara in a slender green tube in a clinique 'gift with purchase' - this is the one. the one you buy is in a slender and slightly larger silver tube. you can brush on coat after coat of this gel like wonder and not get a single clump! wow! this mascara is fiber-free and has been opththalmologist approved for contact lens wearers. the jet black is a true black and the jet brown is noticeably brown on the wand but looks great on the lashes. as with all long wearing eye makeup products such as mascara this one needs to be removed with an eye makeup remover. ",positive
" i don't remember when i first tried this product but now i've been using it for years and i love it! this is a great eye color base. it goes on smoothly without rubbing or pulling the skin and provides a smooth base for powder eye color. i wear it every day under my eye makeup. it makes my eyeshadow last all day without creasing or fading. plus it comes in many colors to compliment whatever colors of eyeshadow you're wearing. try it and you'll love it too ",positive
" in one month this product made my skin so smooth and refreshed that a facial scar from six years ago disappeared from my cheek ",positive
" instant non-greasy moisture for the tender eye area. smooths out fine wrinkles ",positive
" this product is great!!! i wear it during the day under my moisturizer but the biggest difference is when i put a drop or two on at bedtime. one night i was really beat too beat to wash my face so i tried putting a little on over everything instead. it worked great. when i wear it at night my skin looks dewy and fresh and soft like i'm 19 again! (i'm almost 40!) i can't say that everyone will have the same results i do. all i know is that i am very very happy to have found this product! ",positive

" great product from a company that only offers innovative wonderful products- this product shouldn't cost this much though. it costs less at authorized bb. retail outlets and buying bb. products online doesn't guarantee the consumer that they're getting authentic bb. so beware. check out www.bumbleandbumble.com for authorized retailers ",positive
" i love the shine lip glosses offer but really do dislike the stickiness. when wearing a gloss lip prints come off on glasses (paper cups are the worst!) napkins and whoever you've just buzzed. found the answer to the stickies with chanel's aqualumiere line. the lipsticks give the slick shine without the telltale spots. it can be blotted and still shines. as if that weren't enough it's spf15. my favorite shade is macao a rosy pink ",positive
" only drawback. it stays wetter on your face prior to shaving than the competitive stuff i.e. afta which dries quickly so you can get to shaving quicker. ",positive
" i like this cologne although my wife uses it mostly. the fragrance is incredible and from time to time i use it as an air freshner as well. it is subtle yet long lasting and i may only recommend it ",positive
" inis has a very fresh/crisp/clean scent that i love. it's kind of a subtle scent and not overpowering which is what i like about it. it's also very androgynous so a man or woman could wear it. whenever i wear it people always sniff and make comments like what are you wearing? and mmm! you smell so good. ",positive
" this is a really great scent but it could of been better. i think it misses that extra zing you get when you test it on animals. i mean seriously animals want to smell nice too ",positive
" inis has become my favourite perfume every time i wear it i am always being asked what perfume are you wearing? it is light fresh & fragrant not overpowering but makes an impression. i have tried lots of perfumes but none compare to inis. the fact it is not tested on animals is a bonus and also it is not too expensive. can't recommend it enough. buy and try ",positive

" our local macy's recently offered free skin typing and the samples to go with it. i really only went to pick up a free moisturizer as i've found with some judicious sampling you don't have to pay for that item. instead i fell in love with this soap (and got free moisturizer too-hooray!!) when the sales rep first handed me the bar soap i balked. i've known people who've used clinique but just the idea of washing my face with bar soap freaked me out. they do offer a liquid version but the rep told me the soap was a better exfoliant. i can't say for sure if that's so but i can say this really is a great face wash. i was addicted after one use. and since it is a bar of soap you'll get a really great sudsy foam. it has a mild pleasant scent and it washes off easily. i have the mild version and i just love it. my skin feels clean but never tight and not only does it not cause breakouts it immediately calmed the one i had. i'll definitely be buying more. i do want to add however it is drying in the wintertime if you have normal skin and i had to switch to a cream cleanser. it may not be a problem for oily skin. for dry skin i'd really avoid it in the winter at least. you still ideally need a makeup remover before the soap. i also became a recent convert to clinique's rinse off foaming cleanser. but even if you don't want to use that product remember that removing your makeup is a separate step. ",positive
" this is a great product but way too expensive on this site. you can find it for $28.00 ",positive
" i'd never bought a perfume above ten dollars when i tried burberry brit's eau de toilette one day. i couldn't believe how wonderful the scent was especially after it had been on for a while. i splurged on a bottle which seems set to last me for a long time (even with almost-daily use it's still mostly full). i consider this to be my signature scent and get many compliments on it ",positive
" i got this as a gift. i had tested the eau de parfum version at a department store cosmetics' counter and was less than thrilled however the edt was just right for me! i believe in signature fragrances so i'll let this be the signature of one of my many moods.. ",positive

" rice bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin. after just one to two uses you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin. weeks later you look at your skin and it seems like you are at least ten years younger. the smoothness clarity and youthful glow truly shows with continued use. if you have oily or combination skin you may be amazed at how balanced your skin is and how you no longer experience the shine breakthrough in your makeup due to the initially drying aspects of other cleansers. the komenuka bijin facial cleansing foam is very economical and an eighth of a teaspoon is enough for a wonderful face cleansing experience. the ingredients include: rice germ oil rice bran coconut oil seaweed aloe algae ginkgo biloba matricaria yeast perilla ocymoides honey lithospermum and fountain water. the moisture cream goes a long way. the main oils are rice germ oil jojoba oil and olive oil. vitamin e rice bran and aloe make this a skin-healing treat. other products to fall in love with: cleansing powder - packets of deep cleansing grains turn silky and creamy when you add water. makeup remover - a fragrance-free cream that removes makeup and mascara. based on olive oil. uv cream - slightly tinted and waterproof this sunblock also seems to even out skin tone. could be used as a makeup base if you are looking for a more natural look. hair shampoo & conditioner - thickens fine hair instantly. removes buildup and leaves your hair feeling luxurious. essence - this is a product that is magical. it can be used for skin healing and it also lightens freckles and age spots. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" used the cleansing foam then bought the moisture cream. whatever is in rice bran is truly wonderful it cleanses without any dryness and a rosy glow has returned to my skin. have stopped using my old department store stuff replacing 4 of those products with just these 2 with better results. good value on both they should offer a deal on the shampoo and conditioner too ",positive
" i love the smell ... and i much prefer the solid perfume to the spray ... just subtle enough .... ",positive
" i absolutely love this fragrance. when i put this on i get a warm musky scent that lasts for hours. i put the spray cologne version of falling in love on top to brighten it up a bit when i feel like it. it is subtle but i think it is a very sexy and warm scent and not at all overpowering. definitely something my husband wants to be near ",positive
" i was unsure about this item in the store- but took a gamble. i cut 1/3 of the bar up and crumbled it and i wasn't particularly impressed with the smell of it dry. so i grabbed the rest and tossed it all in. wow! it was so silky and smooth against the skin i jumped out and grabbed my husband to join me! with some nice classical music on in the background and a tahitian vanilla candle- you'll think your back in the womb- all safe and warm. the bubbles didn't last very long but it leaves the skin silky and comfortable with out a perfumey scent ",positive
" my first thought on crumbling some of this into my running bath was that it reminded me of bubble baths from when i was kid. there's this really nice subtle clean smell to this bubble bar. i really like that it's not an overpoweringly smelly bubble bar. it's great for those who don't want a flowery bath but who can't tolerate the overwhelming patchouli in the blue skies bar. i wish i'd bought two of these instead of one of this and one of the blue skies. plus this is a good bar for mixing with a bath bomb. really probably any bomb would do. good stuff ",positive
" this was my first lush experience and now i am hooked. something about the scent of this bubble bar relaxes me like nothing else. it didn't smell like hot (coconut) milk to me - it has a warm spicy pleasant scent - but it definitely had that warm milk before bedtime effect. and it works miracles on my rambunctious two-year-old daughter. not only does it produce loads of bubbles (fwiw we have an oversized clawfoot tub and a third of a bar filled it to the top w/bubbles) but the scent seems to calm and relax her as much as me. warning: don't take this bath if you're planning an evening out! you'll just want to snuggle into bed afterwards ",positive
" bubbles nicely but does not smell like hot milk. i've never tried milky bar so i have no idea if the two compare. hot milk? is comforting though. its like being wrapped in warm fluffy towels straight from the dryer ",positive

" i developed acne after i turned 23 and have had limited success using over the counter products. i purchased the acne kit and it began to clear up my skin but i would still get the cysts that took for ever to go away or they would never get to the surface. i starting using the oxygen peel one a week and found that it wasn't doing much and that there was a lot of extra get that i had made that was wasted. i talked to the girl at the counter several days ago about this and i had a huge cyst that was very painful. she told my to use the oxygen peel 3 times in a row and that should help. i would be using all the extra gel that was made and would see more results. i went home that night and did just as she said. i was amazed to see that the painful cyst had risen to the surface and i was able to relieve the pressure. this is a truely amazing product and would recommend it to anyone who has this same proble ",positive
" for a touch of the sun without risking skin damage the always innovative and practical laura mercier came up with the solar flair collection. one of my favorites in this line is the illuminating stick an easy way to achieve an instant glow. the stick is available in two shades golden honey glow which provides a subtle bronze luster and golden rose glow which very much resembles a natural blush. with earth minerals for a lovely luster and shine the color is applied directly to the skin with fingertips or brush. it blends smoothly and leaves a soft velvety texture. there's no limit to where it can be used - as a blush on the apple of the cheeks or across forehead brow bone or chin for a just in from a day at the beach look. for evening my preference is the honey glow applied across shoulders as well. key ingredients include vitamin e vitamin c vitamin a and bismuth oxychoride which acts as a light reflector by sun or moonlight ",positive
" having shaved with everything from cheapo disposables to thiers-issard straight razors i have to say that the merkur progress is probably the best all-around razor available today. it has excellent heft and balance and the adjustment feature is simple and straightforward. (although i do agree that the numbered adjustment seems to perform a little differently depending on the blade used.) it is easy to keep clean--assuming you don't mind unscrewing it and taking the blade out to wipe off the head and frame. having also used a venerable old gillette fat boy from the 1950s i'd still have to rate the progress as a better razor; the screw operated adjustment makes it constantly adjustable not just in steps. since this is a safety razor its performance is significantly dependent on the blades used. i've tried both the merkur blades and the japanese feather blades and would say that it's a toss-up. and since it is an adjustable safety razor it is perfectly suited to two-pass close shaving. a higher setting is excellent on the first pass with the grain of the beard and a lower setting for the pass against the grain. the adjustment also allows you to adjust the razor to the conditions of your skin and beard. if you've let yourself get a day's worth of stubble (c'mon--don't we all?) you can set the blade high to mow that hedge. if you need a quick clean-up before a night on the town you can set it lower for a once lightly james. so if you want a really well-made no-nonsense but very versatile razor that will last for a good long time this is a good bet. the only problem might be preventing pals from swiping it or reminding your wife/significant other to take it apart to clean it after she smooths up those pretty pins you love so well. one recommendation: shop around. you can get these for under $40.00 if you bargain-hunt likewise full 20-count boxes of carded merkur 10-blade refill sets ",positive
" i bought this on a whim because i just remodeled my house after hurricane katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub...nice to take long baths in so of course i needed some bubble stuff. the bath bombs smell wonderful. my whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until i used them all. i even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful (for about a week)! the bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve. the fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day. i loved them and will definitely buy more ",positive
" this was my fisrt foray into lip scrubs. i like the dual concept with a scrub on one side and a lip balm on the other. i also like the fact this slips into you purse or pocket easily so it's convenient for those on the go. i took mine skiing in vail and it was the first time i didn't come home with chapped lips. the textures are good. the scrub side is slightly grainy more of a polish than a scrub. i would not recommend it for heavily chapped lips but it works well for weekly maintenance. the lip balm side is a little waxy but moisturizing with vityamin e. it's quite long-lasting and provides a sweet natural shine. this smells of spun vanilla sweet and sugary. why only 4 stars? i think tarte should have added spf 15 sun protection. doing so would provide sweet kissable lips and the protection you need ",positive
" i got this as a present when it finally came back in stock. the scrub part of the stick does a great job but you need to have lips that aren't in dire need of help for it to really work. to do that just use a moist soft toothbrush and gently scrub. the scrub side will sometimes leave a little sugar behind so you might have to wipe your lips off a little after you use it but i found that this doesn't happen all the time. the balm side goes on smoothly and feels great. it's silky feeling but does not provide a lot of moisture so if you lips are on the dryer side this is not going to replace your regular gloss. this stuff is great for on the go and i will be buying it again when mine runs out ",positive
" forget all those other so-called good colognes out there. happy for men is the best smelling one of them all! it may be expensive but it is well worth it. example: i sprayed down a shirt with it and send it home with my girlfriend at her request! she requested this because she wanted have something of mine that she could sleep with it while we are apart. that is how good it is! enjoy ",positive
" for me happy has a subtley orange undertone and evokes a sense of vibrancy and youth. as with the signature female clinique scents you don't need much to cause a stir and it always leaves a lingering subtle trail of sophistication ",positive
" i'm not kidding it's worth every penny (though i must admit that i get it at a lower price from a secret supplier in asia). after using this you'll swear that you just got a hot oil/deep treatment done from a professional salon. i have chemically treated hair (relaxed double process - colored & fine hair equals damaged hair) and this is the only conditioner that works for me. another plus is this is the only conditioner that elicits your hair smells sooooo good reaction from my boyfriend & daughter. surprisingly even if it moisturizes my hair excellently it still leaves it bouncy & with enough volume. this lasts about 6 months if you use it once a week so it's really not that expensive especially if you substitute this for your regular deep conditioning treatment at the salon. if you're still wary try a smaller bottle ",positive
" the avobath bath bomb turns water a lovely luminous pale green. avocado olive oil lemongrass bergamot rosewood oil gardenia extract makes this a skin calming soothing moisturizing dream. the green luster makes this bath especially beautiful and gives it a mermaid mood. i loved this one so much i'm ordering two the next time. the scent is lemon/lime but by the time you get in the tub the floral scents are more prominent. you can add in some bubbles but they don't seem to last very long - well i was using a bath gel. so you may want to find a bubble bar because the olive oil seems to make them disappear pretty fast. at least that is my theory because i've noticed bath oil does the same thing. avobath goes well with whoosh products or the happy hippy shower gel. if you are in the mood you might want the amazing godiva shampoo and conditioner 2 in 1 bar (has a magical quality - makes hair super shiny) or the i love juicy shampoo and veganese conditioner. the last two also have a citrus scent and are especially delicious. when i use lush products i'm in a good mood all week long. it is truly amazing how happy and content i am as long as i have some lush products around. :) ~the rebecca review ",positive
" this cheery green bomb releases the uplifting scent of lemongrass blended with some other elements that make it well-rounded and fruity - the reviewer who likened it to froot loops cereal wasn't too far off base! add a sizzling lemony-herbal top note to froot loops and you have this bomb's scent. since lemongrass oil is good for uplifting the spirits this is a great bomb for those tired or grumpy days we all have sometimes. there is the mildest shimmer to it that you really have to look for in the water itself and it gives the lime-green water a lovely depth and sparkle. but it isn't glittery and you won't end up with anything you can see on your skin. it is more an in-bath pony trick! this is a great bomb for cheering you up on a wintry day and one i keep a small supply of and use often ",positive
" as we've heard it's not easy being green. it's more than easy it's delightful if you're an avobath bath ballistic. infused with avocado (hence the name) and olive oil it moisturizes skin. the fragrance is fresh rather citrusy thanks to lemongrass and rosewood. bath water is a lovely shade of green rather like new spring grass. if there's glitter in it i didn't find any which was as i wished. it's suggested for morning - i'd relax with an avobath any time of day ",positive
" i love the fresh scent of the avobath there's just nothing like it. it smells like springtime to me. i have yet to notice any glitter in an avobath bath (and i've taken about 10) so if you're glitter shy don't let that stop you from trying this one ",positive
" i like to eat avocados i like avocado face masks and now i can bathe in eau de avocado! this bath bomb is possibly my favorite - very softening great color (turns your tub into a nice green lagoon) and great lemony scent. i didn't find the glitter to be very noticeable so don't worry about that. stock up on this one ",positive
" kai is like lying in a meadow in the warmth of the sun with a gentle breeze and the aroma of a million sweet flowers embracing you. oh how i love it ",positive
" o.kthese glosses are just plain yummy! actuallythey don't taste like lipglosses at allwhich is a good thing.no one wants waxy or chemical flavored gloss that makes you want to throw upright? all the flavors are amazingly delicious.each one tastes just like sweets. the colors are sheer and radiant without looking cheap or tacky. they go with any eyeshadow or blush color and make your lips sparkle. i wish the tubes were just a bit bigger and the glosses were less sticky. overallnice glosses but a bit overpriced for such lil tubes ",positive
" i am absolutely addicted to this lip gloss. i own over 300 different brands of gloss and this is by far one of my favorites. it's a pretty good deal at only $28 for so many colors. i like the small size because it easily fits into any evening bag or pocket. it's fun to layer the different colors as well and there are an infinate amount of combonations between all of the different colors and flavors. they also taste amazing each embodying a yummy taste exactly like sugar. it goes especially well with the aquolina pink sugar fragrance for a sugar-themed cosmetic experience ",positive
" i bought this cream after i tried about a dozen other brands and i loved it. it a bit pricy but it worth every penny. i am 24 so i bought it to smooth out starting lines that i had and prevent new ones. it worked! now i look like i am 20 again ",positive
" was using philosophy's various light scents discovered this burberry london sample in my last sephora shipment. went to macy's and bought the set for under $77-lotion shower gel and 3.3 oz fragrance. fretted over price until i actually used the products-layering them. recieved so many compliments! not an old lady's perfume- not strong nor weak- it has an elegant floral fragrance. top notes: rose clementine and honeysuckle. heart notes: tiare flower jasmine and peony. dry down notes: sandalwood veil of musk and patchouli. all my favorites ",positive
" one of the best perfumes i have tried in a long time... my boyfriend goes crazy over it ",positive
" i've tried several shampoo bars and had finally given up hope that i could ever use them - they had always left my hair feeling gross and gummy - no matter how much i rinsed or tried vinegar/water mix rinses after (as was suggested). but - this one had had some good reviews so i gave it a go. it was awesome! it lathered rather well and rinsed out very easily. i used it in conjunction with the american cream conditioner - and my hair's very very silky and soft right now. (it had gotten very course over the period of a week with using avalon organics shampoo and conditioner) i'm excited - now that i've finally found a shampoo bar that works i can finally say goodbye to bulky shampoo bottles and same some space ",positive
" reincarnate can be a hard shampoo to get used to especially if you're not already using lush products. it doesn't 'sud up' much and feels a little bit muddy and grainy. don't fret though! it will certainly clean your hair and will also leave it smelling like wonderful spices (almost as good as arabian bright). the highlights are not something that come with one or two washings but with many many washings and they are /very/ subtle but there. the only reason i don't give this product five stars is that it was not as conditioning as it states it is and i needed to use another conditioning product with it ",positive
" i bought these with the also great socks and was completely pleased by the way they left my hands hydrated and soft. after leaving them on for half an hour with the glamour gloves gel my hands felt reborn. i couldn't get over how the moisturizers had penetrated. i've had these for a couple years and was almost sure they would stop working but they're still doing the job. i've recently seen less expensive gloves on the market and don't know how well they work but these are very high quality ",positive
" i first caught a waft of this fragrance in a magazine as a tester. i fell in love with the sweet sugary light smell of it and so did my husband. it's perfect for all seasons since it's light and it definitely makes people ask you what you're wearing. i've been told it smells everything from edible to kissably sweet. now i want to try some of their other fragrances. if they are half as good as this they win in my book ",positive
" i have been using this product for about 3 months. it is great! not only have i noticed a difference but i get comments from people all the time about how refreshed i look. i had a baby about 5 months ago and decided that i need to pamper myself a little. i came across this product in january and was very cautious about purchasing another eye cream. nothing has worked in the past. however i decided to give it a try. i noticed changes after a couple of weeks but wasn't sure if it was just me wanting it to work or it actually working. well now after 3 months i can totally tell the difference. i look so much better even without makeup. i don't even need to put concealor under my eyes any more!!! plus i receive so many great comments from people. thank you hylexin. finally something that worked for me ",positive
" this is the first bronzer i actually finished. this gives the most natural finish and blends really well. i like that it's matte because i'm not a fan of sparkly bronzer. ever since i started using this i'm just addicted and can't live without it. it gives the skin a really natural healthy-looking flush. i've got medium/olive skin and i use light. my skin doesn't look orangey or dirty. try it and i'm sure you'll like it. make sure you use a really good brush. ",positive
" i love this fragrance! it reminds me of some of the most beautiful and fragrant flowers of hawaii. if you've ever visited the islands and smelled a pikake lei or walked past luscious jasmine bushes and thought to yourself what is that heavenly smell? this is it! there is not a scent out there on the market that evokes such memories and enjoyment as kai. my only concern about this fragrance line is the $cost$ but how i feel and think when i am wearing it makes it all worth it ",positive
" while most sunscreens these days protect against sunburn did you know that very few of them actually protect against photodamage? only two sunscreen ingredients protect against the long uvai rays that cause photodamage (brown spots wrinkles etc); zinc oxide and parsol 1789. zinc oxide protects a broader range of these rays than does parsol 1789. this skinceuticals sunscreen has zinc oxide and it goes on without any white film or greasiness-perfect for daily use on the face. while neutrogena dry touch suncreens feel more invisible on the skin (you can't even tell it is on except for the smell) and is a good alternative (has parsol 1789) i still prefer the skinceuticals for the added protection and virtually no scent whatsoever. since it's expensive i tend to use it just on the face and use a cheaper (like neutrogena) sunscreen on the body when out in the sun. ",positive
" this mattifying moisturizer is great! it definitely helps with my oily skin and works all day long. i can't say more than enough positive effects this moisturizer has had on m ",positive
" i am satisfied wih both the product and the delivery time. i would order it again ",positive
" this foundation provides a flawless finish and natural look while also giving a good coverage. i've been using this foundation for years all year long and it is one of my favorites. not too heavy and not too light it's the perfect foundation. being asian american and with a light complexion finding a good color match had always been a problem unless i spent $40 for a bottle of makeup. zhen is one of the best deals around - clean but stylish packaging with a superior product inside ",positive
" this product is truly amazing! the application method can be a bit tricky and the performance varies depending on the type of mascara you use but if you follow the directions and find a good mascara formula then you will have long long lashes. my lashes are medium length but when i use this people who know me thing i am wearing falsies. this stuff rocks! i've never been able to find a mascara that can do what this does ",positive
" is so true of this product. i have to admit when i first saw the price tag of this product it was half out of curiousity that i purchased. i mean could a pair of $20 tweezers be that much better than the ole $1.75 or $3 pairs at home? well if your asking yourself that question yes! these things have amazing grip and can pull the tinyiest of hairs. things that you would have to dig with normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw. without a doubt you will get your moneys worth from this product as well as be amazed at their performance. it's the type of wow that makes you feel like how did i ever get along without these before. worth every penny and i'll never buy another cheap tweezer again. these have lasted for years and still retain their fine point. ",positive
" i had an amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on. it so happened that i needed new tweezers. i read the reviews and thought i'd give these a try. wow i can't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers i have ever owned. they almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp. it is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair. tweezerman tweezers rock! ",positive
" i'm sure that you don't need any more assurance but just to let you know i've had my tweezerman's for over 5 years now. they are still sharp! plus if you ever were to drop them they probably wouldn't be significantly damaged. these tweezers are a must have. ",positive
" i purchased this one month ago and i will never use anything else. blends wonderfully great colors. i bought it for my daughter from amazon/sephora as well. great product ",positive
" these are great for removing excess oil when you can't stop and wash your face or don't want to disturb your makeup. i prefer this brand because they unfold to twice their size when you pull them out instead of the size of a half-dollar like the rest of them ",positive
" i have been wearing obsession since 1986 and it has definitely not gone out of style. every day i get a comment from someone about how good i smell. my boss even bought some obsession for his wife because he likes it so much on me. this is my favorite perfume ",positive
" i have been wearing obsession by calvin klein since it was first launched in 1985 the year i first arrived in california. it seems i am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. while i prefer the eau de parfum spray i have both variations. although at first this tends to have a strong aroma this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. i love the blend of vanilla mandarin orange peach and lemon that make up the scent of obsession. my preference is more of a racy provocative alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers. with my skin irritations asthma and allergies i have no problems with spraying my body parts with obsession. the color is quite appealing reminding me of spiced rum with the brown amber and gold tones. obsession cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings. this is definitely a feminine scent sweet sexy and not too fruity or powerful. there is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease. sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces. once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin i detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance.net that obsession has oriental spices. it really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years. this is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons. i would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal. the appeal of obsession seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties from conservative ladies to party animals. although it is a darker color than most fragrances there is no staining on clothing but i do not wear sweaters whites or turtlenecks. when i do use the glass jar i have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish/brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips. obsession is a potent and romantic perfume for evening. the prices of the assorted sizes of obsession range from forty to sixty dollars. ",positive
" i'm a cologne junkie and of my vast collection armani mania is clearly my #1. i'm into my 3rd bottle of this potion and it continues to bring on the compliments and inquiries of what's that cologne you're wearing it smells fantastic! you cannot - repeat - cannot go wrong here. a modern classic ",positive
" this is by far the best shampoo and conditioner set i have used. i have very fine very straight and very long hair that breaks easily but not with this shampoo and conditioner. this set makes it smooth but not oily and so when i brush my hair there is no yanking going on. my hair is noticeably more shiny and soft. it has a very pleasant scent and it is all natural. what a great way to pamper yourself! definitely worth the extra investment ",positive
" i was a bit apprehensive to purchase a candle this expensive but i was very pleased with the scent clean burning and look of the candle and the packaging it came in. the havana is a scent that both my husband and i enjoyed ",positive
" mistral as many know is a powerful gusty wind that blows across the south of france. mistral as i was happy to discover is also the name of a line of bath and body products all french inspired all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. matthew tilker founder and president of mistral utilizes shea butter which is an efficacious natural healer in a myriad of must-have forms. derived from the nuts of the african shea tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women) this butter is highly emollient a boon for those with dry skin chapped lips any number of skin irritations. the pure shea butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). south seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming soothing as a tropical island. the marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit white flowers and soft woods. an irresistible combination. south seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel body lotion massage bath and body oil bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices. highly recommended ",positive
" the cream is great. it instantly gets absorbed after application and i believe helps over time close up leakage of blood capilleries (which causes black circle appearences). i suffered from chronic dark circles. this cream after 1 month of application has considerably lightened my dark circles and has reduced puffiness. i would suggest anyone who is looking for an effective cream give this product a shot. considering my condition i still have light dark circles left and hope this cream will continue to benefit me. i still have doubts on this cream totally brightening my skin tone around my eyes but never the less i find it effective ",positive
" through luck of genetics i have dark circles. i've had them since as far back as i can remember. no amount of sleep eat well or generally good lifestyle choices changed my dark circles. i was pretty hesitant to try it out since woah... $95 is a lot of money but i gave it a shot. i used it exactly per the instructions. i was actually pretty discouraged because i didn't see a change but then bam in the 3rd week of using it i woke up and my circles were soooo much noticably lighter. i could cry. it's hard being so young and having dark circles under your eyes but now i look more my age. and i'm still only in the 3rd week so i have a lot of hope for the product. i feel badly for the people who didn't get a reaction but as they state in their pamphlet it will not work on 100% of people. like anything really won't work for 100% of people. but it worked for me and i'm so very happy. i would have paid sooo much more for these results. ",positive
" have had dark circles caused by pigmentation for four years and have tried everything.have been using hylexin for just five days and honestly its been amazing.i saw all the bad reviews and im glad they didnt stop me.for the first time in years i dont need a concealer.will continue to keep you posted as i hope in the nxt week or two not to have any circles at all.(if it continues this way) i think mayb the product doesnt work for hereditery circles ",positive
" i love how this product works and feels on my skin!! does an excellent job off removing makeup and cleaning the skin with out drying your skin out! makes skin feel cool and clean!! i have very sensitive skin an was concerned that this product was going to break my skin out or be very drying because this product tones as well as cleanses the skin. but that wasn't the case. my skin didn't break out nor is this product drying. highly recommend! ",positive
" i used this relaxer for the first time after using many brand name ones. i was impressed with the results. it leaft my hair with much needed moisture and very shiny. i normally apply the realxer myself at home but i choose to go professional to really capture the promises that this product states. the smell was not noticeable which was good since most chemicals are so harsh and strong. it didn't burn my scalp like most have. the quantity was ample considering that most relaxers are cheap with the amount they give i think that it was worth the price! i'll be buying it again ",positive
" this is by far the most expensive relaxer i've ever used and it is worth every penny. i first heard of it as being oprah's relaxer so i decided to hunt it down. one of the best things i've ever done. i have very coarse thick horsehair that usually defeats most over the counter perms after a few washings. not phytospecific's relaxer. my hair stayed soft and straight no matter what the weather or i did to it. and it's the healthiest it's ever been. no other relaxer ever did that for my hair. in fact they usually made it worse! i absolutely love the phytorelaxer and i am officially addicted. if it were less pricey it would get 5 stars ",positive
" i'm black have kinky hair and i've been relaxing my hair for about 25 years. i've used many many types of relaxers to my dismay:- hair falling out breaking dry etc. so i let my hair rest for about 5 years then i tried the relaxer thing again after i found phyto. i've been doing my own hair now for about 1 year and it's been great!- except for the price. my hair still feels as if it has life in it it it is not breaking it is not falling out. it burns like regular straightener. i use vinegar to neutralize it then use the neutralizing shampoo with indicator to check for pink. please there's not enough neutralizing shampoo to get rid of the staraightener. the price is scary but i'm more afraid of having my hair fall out and having to fix that. soon i'll have to get a hairdresser though because my hair has now been retaining it's length and growing - and it's harder to straighten it myself. ",positive
" this is not sticky lip gloss. the rose tone is easy to wear . it's sweet and natural tone. you can mix colors and than create new color on your lips !! you don't need to shop tons of glosses and lip sticks. this is it ! plus the palette case is cute ",positive
" i'm a big fan of non-traditional perfumes - i don't care for sweet floraly scents and i have been known to poach my man's cologne occassionally just to enjoy the scent all day. so if you like citrusy/woodsy scents you must try this one - it has an unusual top note and dry-down that are hard to describe but anyway it never fails to get compliments from men and the what are you wearing? from women. it's intense but it's not overpowering the way some orientals can be. but it's also summery-light. i can't explain it - just try it. a couple of times. and for something even more unusual try jardin mediterrenne (sp?) also by hermes - the only perfume i've ever given 5 stars ",positive
" i *love* this formula for my thick naturally curly slightly hilighted hair. it does a great job cleaning without stripping and this is the first conditioner that did a good job tackling my naturally curly hair without weighing it down. i did get a good deal at my salon - $9 for the shampoo and a little more for the conditioner ",positive
" to tell you the truth i have tried everything on my hair to take away the frizz. nothing really worked at all...but biosilk is a miracle! the first time i tried it i noticed a major difference in my hair. just add a little bit to your hair and it will immediately smooth it out adding shine and softness. it will also not weigh your hair down or make it too greasy..just don't use that much of it. i mostly use this with my flat-iron and i get amazing results. i happen to like the smell of it...it reminds me of being in a salon! try the shampoo and conditioner as well ",positive
" i have wavy and coarse hair and i have a whole lot of it. i use this product after shower on damp hair and then blow-dry. this product really works and makes my hair soft and silky and it gives the hair nice movement and makes it easy to style. my hairdresser who has similiar hair as mine recommended me this product and she said she loves it. i am very happy to find this product before wasting a lot of money on trying others that don't work. it is a bliss ",positive
" my hair stylist first introduced me to this product a few years ago and i've used it ever since. it makes your hair really soft and shiny and even smells good. just a little of biosilk goes a long way. gets rid of the frizz and dryness and really improves the look and feel of your hair. i definitely reccomend it ",positive
" i was hooked on sebastian's shine serum forever. then i switched to this after hearing all the rave reviews. it makes it just as shiny as the sebastian but for my thick wavy hair it is easier to apply. i only need about a quarter size amount way less than any other product. it has a nice soft finish. so if you like sebastian and redkin's shine serums you'll like this. i'm not going to go as far as to say it's a miracle worker. it makes your hair shinier. it helps a little with my frizz but doesn't depouf. ",positive
" i have straight hair but it is super-long and thick past my waist so i have problems combing it and keeping it smooth. biosilk is the best stuff i have found to detangle after washing and keep my hair soft after it is dry. i have tried everything else and i mean everything and nothing compares. i'm so hooked i have bought it by the gallon and believe me that is not cheap! it even smells great it's not greasy and it is fantastic for giving or receiving massages too ",positive
" this is truly one of the best hand and nail creams out there. it is quickly absorbed and not at all greasy - i put some on before i walk out the door in the morning and again before bedtime and it has made a real difference in the softness of my hands and the health of my cuticles. hangnails have always been a problem for me but this product keeps them under control as long as i apply it regularly. love it! ",positive
" i really like this mascara. i only gave it 4 because it is clumpy and i have to spend a little time with my eyelash comb getting the clumps out. otherwise it is the only mascara that doesn't cause me to loose a ton of lashes. everything else from estee lauder bourjois to great lash causes me loose a lot of lashes. i also like that if i cry i don't wind up looking like a raccoon it subtly melts away; no mess! it washes off easily with soap and water and is flexible not flaky. ",positive
" i have been using mascara since i was a teenager and this is absolutely the best ever. ocassionally i have read reviews about other 'fantastic' mascaras and strayed and tried them only to be disappointed. now i wouldn't even bother trying anything else even when given in free gift packs. i have very long fair eyelashes and use black. the brush is easy to guide and you do not end up with big thick clumpy patches especially when the mascara is new. it parts and separates the lashes perfectly. for night i apply 2 coats for a more dramatic look. it never smudges and is easy to remove (i use clinique 'naturally gentle eye make-up remover'). and yes it may be a little expensive but it lasts for ages (doesn't dry out like other mascaras)and the quality of the product surpasses anything else. also my eyes tend to be a little sensitive and i have never had any problems even when accidentally getting the mascara in my eye. try it you won't be disappointed ",positive
" this mascara is great. i've tried many and this is the only one that doesn't smudge all over the place. the only drawback is the price. it's triple what drugstore brands cost ",positive
" follow the cleanser with the komenuka bijin skin lotion and you may wonder why you are suddenly catching the scent of sake. in fact this cleansing toner does contain sake along with rice bran seaweed aloe yeast glycyrrhizate orange lemon matricaria algae luffa cylindrica and fountain water. the toner completes the process of removing impurities and also has the added benefit of contracting the pores so they look smaller. men may also enjoy this as an aftershave lotion. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" this salve is just perfect under bliss's softening socks. it's amazing how much you can smear on leave on with the socks for at least half an hour and have all those great softening agents completely absorbed when you take off the socks. it leaves feet renewed. use it once or twice a week to tame tough tootsies ",positive
" this is for sure one of my new favorite sets. the scent is nice and clean. the lotion and gel left a very nice scent also.. ",positive
" i bought this perfume for my husband and both of us love it. very sexy and yet a clean scent at the same time. it's light enough to be perfect for the man who normally doesn't wear perfumes yet elegant enough for the man who does ",positive
" i received this razor as a birthday gift from my brother a couple of weeks ago. i thought hmmm...handsome looking vintage piece but there's no way in hell i'm gonna put that meat cleaver to my face! well guilt got the best of me i figured the razor looked expensive so i'll give it a go and hope that if i die from blood loss the police will figure out that my death was from shaving with a new razor and it's not from suicide. i'll tell you after a few times shaving with this razor i am now going to retire my gillette fuzion. it's takes a bit longer to shave with this razor than with a conventional multi-blade but the results are undeniably better. my wife can't wait to kiss my cheek with school girl glee right after i shave! i have a beard that is as tough as sandpaper and i've never had a closer shave than with this merkur. i don't have the same spots to go over and over again and therefore my face is less irritated. i use a brush a glycerin based shave cream and always shave in the shower and that makes a significant difference as well. factor in that blades for this razor costs so much less then mach 3 & fuzion's (i buy cryogenically tempered blades that last 2x longer than store bought) and the way to opt out from expensive razor marketing ploys becomes clear. don't sit on the fence on this one ditch whatever mach to the nth power razor you're using and pick this merkur asap ",positive
" this razor rocks... the proper technique is easy to learn: short light strokes down then up (if you want a closer shave). this gives me hardly any nicks compared to the gillette mach 3 and is way easier to unclog than the shick quattro. the sample blade continues to last with about 2 shaves a week since dec. 2006. typical razor cartridges wouldn't even come close to that longevity and they cost about 4 times as much as the replacement merkur blades which are 50 cents each. i am just doing facial shaving with it at this point; hopefully it will fare just as well with head shaving. i expect i'll be using merkur for the rest of my life ",positive
" my very first de razor after many recommendations and i must say that i am yet another one of those enthusiastic supporters of the merkur hd de safety razor. i may eventually decide to upgrade but if i ever do it will only be after much practice with this razor and simply for the sake of having the adjustment feature which may or may not be necessary for some individuals depending on the toughness and thickness of your beard. when used in conjunction with a badger hair shaving brush some excellent shaving cream (proraso was my first and the only thing mildly unpleasant is the scent and even that grows on you after a while...check your local target near the women's spa section) and the highest quality de razor blade changed every so often of course this razor provides an excellent close irritation-free shave. after using this marvel i vow never to return to the cheaply made ridiculously expensive (when the cost of replacement cartridges is considered over the course of a man's shaving lifetime) multi-blade systems of gillette or schick. just be a little more careful of your technique and getting an outstanding shave from this razor should be a cinch. highly recommended ",positive
" i'm a first time de shaver and this razor is great. my grandfather used these types of razors and it feels wonderful to be able to enjoy shaving rather than scraping my face with a mach iii. only advice is try a couple different blades. depending on your skin type/beard you'll need a different type of blade. one blade doesn't fit all. and always remember this isn't the mach iii don't apply pressure ",positive
" this razor returns one to an augustinian sense of progress and history. it is similar to what my grandfather used to shave with and is simply the best way to shave so long as you have a decent brush and soap at hand ",positive
" i have very fine poker straight hair that is not dry or oily. then i got this conditioner and big shampoo and my hair regained it's shine but more importantly -- i got bounce! i never had any waves or body in my hair before but this conditioner did it. i have used the big shampoo with other conditioners and it was not as good for me. i like big shampoo but this veganese conditioner is the real key to my newly bouncy hair. veganese just works perfectly for me and my hair has never looked better. one thing -- i kind of hate the smell and i do not think it is lemony at all. it smells...i don't know too much like an granola girl or something -- almost patchouli-like to me. however it leaves my hair looking super so really who cares if it smells good in the shower ",positive
" this conditioner leaves hair ultra-soft and doesn't weigh it down. if you have trouble with conditioners leaving a strong residue on your hair this one won't. the ingredients contain rosemary infusion lavender flower infusion seaweed and fresh lemon juice. the lemon is great for washing the hair clean of residue. it's a great conditioner ",positive
" if your hair alternates between various moods every day of the week then a good supply of conditioners and shampoos should keep you happy all year long. the lemon oil in two of the lush products work together especially well. veganese conditioner and i love juicy shampoo could not be a better solution if you need to deep clean your hair. like after you have put too much hairspray in your hair or you went swimming or say you fell in a mud puddle (in that case also reach for happy hippy body wash). you just never know what may occur and one must always be prepared. the veganese is also a lovely vegetarian product that can be enjoyed by anyone. it has a very clean happy energy and a lemony scent. the slippery conditioner slicks across your hair making it shiny and manageable without weighing it down. this also contains rosemary infusion lavender flower infusion seaweed and fresh lemon juice. will be appreciated by anyone trying to lighten their hair. if you use the henna products by lush these two products might slightly lighten your henna results. this could be desired or you may want to go back to using rehab and american cream if you want to keep a deeper henna shade. if you want to feel light and breezy this conditioner won't weigh you down. my hair feels fluffy and deliciously light and bouncy. i have this strange urge to go wander in lemon orchards run through mud puddles and pick flowers by the side of the road. now officially in the mood to make lemonade! ~the rebecca review ",positive
" i used veganese for quite awhile quite happily. as there is no artificial fragrance or strong natural fragrance oils in the product it has a ho-hum scent. this actaully was a nice break from all the overwhelmingly perfumed hair products on the market. i felt veganese adequately conditioned my hair did not irritate my scalp. i liked that it had no animal products and is not tested on animals. those who try to avoid chemicals may not like sodium lauryl sulfate in this product ",positive

" i purchased this pumice stone to help remove the dried skin on my feet and ankles that appears as you get older. it does a good job and comes in its own small case. i use it frequently and find that i have much less dry skin in that area now ",positive
" you use the peel kit by mixing a clear gel capsule with water and smear that onto your face.you then put some cream on top of the gel on your face which mixes together creating a shaving cream beard. after using the creams you then scrape it off using a tongue depressor look alike to shave off the foam. after a quick rinse my skin looked less dull and helped clear blotches.4 stars because i ran out of the cream and still have some unused gel capsules ",positive
" i really like this peel. it is very easy to use and i have noticed a difference in my skin. it is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading. i even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing. i recommend this peel to anyone. i have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation. i use this one about twice a week. i also recommend the microdelivery vitamin c peel. that one i use once a week. jennife ",positive
" calling this a peel doesnt seem quite right. when i think of the word peel i imagine the old gel type peels that you would let dry on your face and then take off like a mask. or i think of something that is harsh or abrasive. while this works like a peel it is gentle and goes far beyond what you would expect a facial product to do. you need this product if you - your skin is prone to break out and is very congested - your skin is sun damaged - your skin is aging rapidly - you enjoy in-office medical peels - you have a big event coming up and want your skin to look great - you want to maximize penetration of your treatment products - you want baby soft skin also if you smoke! i first tried this years ago when i was a smoker and it made such a difference in the texture and clarity of my skin. this is a truly amazing product and completely different and unique to anything else on the market. try it and you'll see. this product also lasts a surprisingly long time. you only use half a capsule for each treatment which gives you several months of usage out of it ",positive
" i wanted to try a new lipgloss because all of the colored ones that i have are horrificly sticky and if they aren't sticky they do not stay on for long. this one however manages to combine my love for lipgloss with all the needs of a chapstick. the color (apple a day) was intimidating looking in the tube but looks perfectly on and doesn't go anywhere. it also has no stickyness! yay! i love this gloss and is the perfect gloss for all of my needs! ",positive
" the first time i smelled this intoxicating scent i knew i had to have it for myself. it's heady rich very exotic dark and mysterious....when i wear this perfume i envision a room filled with beautiful brown skinned women with dark black hair and richly colored silks of red and purple covering their bodies laying around on organza and brocade covered chaises eating sweet dark fruit and sipping red wine from cobalt glasses ",positive
" though i have never traveled the world this perfume allows me to feel like a veteran globe trotter it is sophisticated without being obnoxious. i genuinely feel like a woman of intrigue and experience. though fanciful it is fun for a homegrown rose. ",positive
" caleche is an absolute classic. i'm often stopped and asked what i'm wearing. pretty much everything at the department stores smells the same (like chemicals). caleche is the real thing and the soie de parfum lasts. make sure when purchasing that you don't accidentally buy caleche eau delicate...it's a completely different frangrance guaranteed to make you gag. why do marketers keep coming up with subtle twists to existing fragrances (miracle happy pleasures poison)? once you try caleche you'll no longer look for anything else; i highly recommend the lotion and shower gel too ",positive
" lipstick going. this review is for the guava stain shade. i first bought this lipstick i believe in the mid to late eighties. i was delighted with it then and am now. it is sheer light non greasy and the color never changes. the color is not neutral but i find that i can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade i wear. i would buy different brandsdifferent shades and wear them maybe once then back to guava stain. it along with clinque's soft pressed blush in new clover orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites and the one's i reach for time and again. they are my dependables. daytime wear for sure not night this is a subtle sheer color ",positive
" i love get fresh products especially the lemongrass lavendar scent. i use the hand sugar scrub (which is very moisturizing and gets rid of cooking odors on hands). it is very light and pleasant as are the others. i love the look better naked kit and the relief for tattered tootsies kit. i am a beauty junkie and i have used much more expensive products but i never seem to like them as much as these. great gift- the hatbox design is very cute ",positive
" ooohh sparklies!!!!! you can put this on your face. make you very much pretty. turn the heads of boy types. stops traffic!! ",positive
" i have always carried a soft spot in my hear for shiny metallic eye shadows and metallic browns chocolates coppers and vanilla such as in this quad for look fantastic on pretty much any complexion. each prismatic color cube is in it's own tiny little clear box with a tiny lid on those i discard and simply keep the top four squares open unless i out the entire top lid on once i'm done doing my makeup. i love to sweep the palest shimmery vanilla on the entire brow bone and my whole lid i usually wear black liquid liner right under the lash line and right on top creating a black back drop that make applying any eye makeup on top easy and gives it great depth. then i use the darkest color with a short brush i cut on an angle to blend the dark color on top of the liner for a smoky and glowing effect. the other two colors i layer on top in between the vanilla base and the dark smoke but i don't feel the need to use all four colors at the same time. i also wet the brush sometimes visine is good for making liquid liner type of a finish when used on a brush and then dipped in some shadow. the colors have deep intensity to them and they sparkle like melting precious metals in the sun. wonderful for any makeup novice or artist for their ease of use and the dramatic and breath taking effect they so easily produce. - kasia s.

" i've never smelled anything like this. if you've ever been to the mediterranean coast you will be instantly transported by this scent. it goes on strong lasts long and dries down to a wonderfully woodsy-citrusy finish that definitely has a bit of ocean air - but not the yankee candle ocean water type scent... this is the real thing like an aromatherapy treatment you can take with you! rejoice all women who are tired of sugary-syrupy womens' perfume! this is it ",positive
" this fragrance takes you on holiday to a place you may never have been. it is a warm environment smelling of salt water and warm skin. there is a tang in the air of citrus maybe grapefruit. this blend is absolutely delicious inspring a hunger for more. i simply can't get enough of un jardin en mediterranee. the eau de toilette is very light and subtle. fresh but not girly. tangy not sweet. this fragrance is for women who understand the allure of salt and warm skin. i purchased this fragrance 3 weeks ago and have worn nothing else since; it will remain one of the four or five fragrances i wear. i look forward to when the line expands to include body cremes or lotions or bath products ",positive
" an awesome product that sells out - and that's the only problem! i had to call around the us to find it in a department store in stock and that would ship. amazon's supplier was sold out. ",positive
" proraso shave cream is the best bang for the buck in hi-end non drugstore shave creams. i've tried them all and keep coming back to proraso. the texture consistency and effectiveness of the cream are first rate - and you don't need a badger hair brush! i initially missed using a brush at first but don't miss all the product i wasted that were left behind in the bristles. couple proraso with a good safety razor (may i suggest merkur) and you'll get a shave that trounces anything a mach iii can throw at you. trust me ",positive

" i typically don't wear much cologne or perfume but this one is a winner! my husband bought this one for me for christmas i'd never even seen it before but he liked how it smelled. what a great guy! i couldn't have been happier with this gift. i love this scent...clean and fresh...you can wear this scent day or night not heavy or overwhelming. the unique beauty of the bottle is wonderful too. highly recommend beyond paradise ",positive
" beyond paradise is a wonderful flirty floral scent that isn't too overpowering. i recommend wearing it whenever you want to feel extra feminine ",positive

" this lip gloss is super!!! not only does it glide on your lips it has staying power. the colors are so subtle and pretty. it is worth every penney and i will not waste my money on cheaper sticky and short-lived lip glosses ",positive
" i bought the laura mercier kit: mini glaces with six glaces including: champagne glace rose glace bare beige glace ambre rose glace petal glace and violet glace. my favorite was rose but all of the colors are very beautiful. i also have a full size of melon another of my favorites. while the colors are beautiful provide lots of shine and are long wearing they are very sticky. mac lip glass is much stickier so if you don't mind that they might be right for you. also the good thing about the kit is that you get to try lots of different colors but the tubes are quite small with a steep price. so if you are willing to put up with a sticky gloss and a high price tag in exchange for some of the most beautiful colors this might be the right gloss for you. ",positive
" lips need a little shimmer in the summer which is why i'm a fan of laura mercier's lip glaces. while they do come in 14 luscious shades my two current faves are cancun coral and miami pink. the cancun coral is a soft coral which i like for day wear and the miami pink has all the sparkle and pizzazz of hot pink - perfect for evening (especially with mercier's pressed powder bronzer). all the shades are abundantly blessed with vitamin e lanolin and mineral oil to soften and smooth lips. these glaces aren't at all heavy or sticky - they're light go on easily evenly and don't bleed over lip lines if you take a bite of something good. glaces can be worn alone or over lip color if you want to give added gleam to a favorite lipstick ",positive
" all right for starters i always have thought curve to be a very cheep crappy cologne. but i had never smelled it i had always hurd it from friends and family that it sucked. well the other day i was at work and some girl that has always liked me gave me two samples of curve. i tried them out and loved the origanal curve the smell is sweet but still masculine girls love it all the time girls say you smell really good and ask what i'm wereing and i always say that smell is all me baby but really i have curve to thank for all the action i've been getting you have to try it out for your self. i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

" i've generally been a one-cologne guy -- i had settled into using acqua di gio for a number of years after having used nautica for a number of years as well. when she got pregnant several months ago my wife confessed to me that she really didn't like acqua di gio (this after two years! pregnancy does heighten sensitivity to smell though). i still had some nautica around plus the original and no-longer-made zegna scent from spain so i used those for a while. i then bought the newest zegna cologne z after my wife smelled it and found it unobjectionable. well no sooner had i bought the z then my wife found a scratch and sniff of curve in some magazine and said that i really should be using that. the next day we happened to be at k-mart -- k-mart!!! -- for some household odds and ends and my wife came across a display of curve. she insisted on buying it for me. ever since then my wife goes nuts when i use it. i don't use it during the week really -- i'm a somewhat older guy and it has a sweetish overtone to it that's not very serious -- but whenever i do my wife always tells me how absolutely wonderful i smell indeed how delicious i smell. today was casual friday at work so i figured okay. i leave for work very early before my wife is awake. sure enough she calls me at work this morning -- you used curve today didn't you? i can tell because the bathroom smells wonderful! every woman i know who has commented on it loves it on guys. so it's less expensive and available at k-mart. and yes it is a little bit sweeter than most colognes i'm personally used to. but it does have a pleasant smell and if the women love it well . . . ",positive
" almost every time i wear curve i get comments from the ladies a very good thing. i currently have 10 different types of cologne and i wear this one a lot. it seems good and the scent lasts throughout the day without having to drench yourself in it ",positive
" these are absolutely the best they get every hair easily..the points are soo sharp these are worth the money trust me id recommend to anyon ",positive
" i have an oily t-zone or i should say had. i started using this product because i was breaking out a lot due to the extra oil my skin was producing to keep my face moisturized. not only has my face cleared up but it has a nice healthy shine to it all day. no makeup necessary. ",positive
" it is definitely a great moisturizer. if you're looking for something that is thick but not greasy and won't make you look like you're frying an egg on your forehead this is definitely it! the texture also makes it easy to apply makeup on afterwards. i use it everyday in the morning time after i wash my face. the only thing to be careful is if you have extremely dry and parched skin and are exfoliating daily to the point where your skin is aching then try to stay away from this moisturizer until your skin heals. i was overdosing my skin with benzoyl peroxide aha acids and retinol a few months ago leaving my skin extremely sensitive. when i put on this gel it would make my skin burn. but other than that you're safe using it on a daily regular normal routine ",positive
" this product is worth the price! i use it every day especially my whole eye area and i love it! it does not leave my skin feeling or looking greasy either. ",positive
" i have been using this starter kit for almost a month and i am beginning to see results. my experience with this product has been that my skin definitely got worse before it got better. for the first few weeks my skin seemed to explode with more acne than usual... however last week it started to clear up rapidly. i'm still having blemishes pop up daily but they disappear within a few days and overall my skin is much smoother and my (many many) scars are less visible. i have struggled with moderate to severe acne for 6 years and have tried more products and treatments than i care to remember and decided to try murad after it was suggested to me (i'd never heard of it before). it certainly is no miracle product where you see results instantly (especially if you have a moderate to severe acne problem) but i just re-ordered the starter kit and am hoping the results will continue to improve. this product is definitely worth a shot ",positive
" murad promises the miracle cure for acne. while the product is good it's not a miracle. i've been usines murad for two months and while my skin has improved it's not flawless. i still get break outs and they still take a while to heal. i'll keep using it because it's a skin routine as good as any other and who knows maybe my skin will improve ",positive
" this is my favorite soap in the world. a new bar will scent my bathroom for weeks and the scent lingers on my skin as well. the soap is gentle and long-lasting. i recommend it highly ",positive
" i'm an admitted soap snob so i've probably tried just about every soap there is. mistral soap is right up there with the best. first of all i have to mention the customer service. i had bought another brand of soap that came in a very pleasing scent combo that mistral didn't offer. i emailed mistral's customer service asking them to consider making it. i got a reply right away and after a few email exchanges was told they would see what could be done. i like that--being responsive to the customer. what do i like about the soap? for one thing the size. it's huge at 7 oz. i also like the scents offered: very pleasing combinations that stay on the skin in a subtle way once you rinse and dry. best of all is how it lathers up on the skin and once rinsed off leaves no residue. it does leave the skin soft. ",positive
" naturally with a name like buffy i would have tried this. whether i like it or not i get these on a regular basis from friends and family who see my name splattered all over it. lucky for me i like. ever heard the expression 'soft as a baby's butt'? erm no? easy. simple to use obviously. no messing with jars or bottles. just go to town massaging those pesky areas - i'm convinced it works wonders on orange peel skin and cannot be persuaded otherwise. ",positive
" i have some dry bumpy bits at the top of my arms that have been resistant to any scrubby product i've ever tried to use but buffy got my skin so smooth! amazing and highly recommended. soak in the tub/shower/whatever so the hot water softens up your skin then scrub away. the small bar lasts 2 or 3 uses; the large is twice as big. the small one is more reasonably priced for people who just want to sample the stuff. this thing has lots of great little scrubby bits in it. ground rice ground almonds and adzuku beans. not just one but three and they are all super-scrubby. you'll be a little red when you're done but it's so worth it once you've cooled off and your skin is as smooth as a baby's bottom. the only downside is that it makes your tub look like somebody dumped sand into the bottom of it once the thing drains. the bar melts at around 'hot water' temperature and you're not supposed to use any moisturizer after using this stuff - but you really don't have to! the moisturizing oils in the bar really do work very well. i'll definitely be picking up a couple more of these. the cocoa butter/lemon/lavendar scent is really amazing as well. soothing and refreshing it can wake you up in the morning or calm you down at night before you go to sleep. definitely try this thing though if you're looking for ultimate exfoliation plus moisturizing ",positive
" i am 40 and fell in love with this scent right away. the nice thing is you don't need to douse yourself with it to get the effect. my motherwho is 75 never mentions my perfume noticed it right away and kept asking me about it. i just ordered her some for her birthday ",positive
" i am in my mid 30's. i am not a britney fan at all. i received a department store sales flyer in the mail a few days ago and it had a sample of fantasy in it. out of curiosity i opened it and could not believe i liked the scent. my husband and i are both picky about perfume. i decided to order a sample size off of ebay before buying the full monty - because the last perfume we both really liked was sensi - but it made my husband sick after a bit. well i got it yesterday and i still really like it. i am shocked the sweetness that it starts with does not give me a headache. i think i will buy a full sized bottle once my sample is gone ",positive
" i just got this perfume for valentine's day. i love it! yes it is sweet smelling as another reviewer mentions but it's a pleasant sweetness. cotton candy does describe it actually. but who says grownups don't like smelling yummy?? there's a hint of vanilla as well and overall i think the combo is fantastic! i love curious and now i love fantasy too! they are two very different perfumes so it's easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other. i will say though that fantasy lasts far longer than curious. you can apply it in the morning and still smell it when you go to sleep! which i don't mind at all... i recommend this of course but i recommend you sample it before you buy. just because you liked curious doesn't mean you will like this one ",positive
" this body butter is yummy. it smells good. it feels good on. it is a must for dry skin. ",positive
" the smell is great the feel on the skin is great! just like the other reviews suggest! ",positive
" this is a minty fresh soap that keeps its fragrance by being topped with a black wax layer (hence demon in the dark.) before you put this in the shower cut off the wax. then enjoy the tingling soap. very invigorating ",positive
" i purchsed this product for my husband and he hates beauty products. when we got it the minty scent was soooo strong in the box. when we opened the box it was like a minty apple juice drink. he used it and i was all over him and the minty smell gave him just the right energy to bring it ",positive
" i have been struggling with dry skin and mild acne for years. recently i revamped my cleansing routine and my makeup. i bought the philosphy purity cleanser and hope in a jar. it has made an unbelievable difference in my skin! my skin is smooth not a dry flake anywhere. it is as soft as a baby's butt. it is worth noting that a little goes a long way. you only need a very small amount (about the size of a dime or less) for your whole face. it is a very light texture almost like a mousse and glides over your skin and absorbs quickly. if you use too much (i did the first few times)then your face could look greasy. if you remember that less is more then you will get a perfectly moisturized yet matte complexion. after using the philosophy cleanser and hope in a jar i use the bare escentuals mineral makeup (bought the light/fairly light starter kit). my skin for the first time ever is flawless. no acne. no dry skin. no reddish areas. just a perfectly smooth complexion. i keep looking in the mirror thinking is this my skin? really? i cannot believe what a difference this product (and the mineral makeup) has made. i have heard of others being allergic to some ingredients in the hope in a jar so it is not for everyone. i suggest getting a sample size to make sure you won't have a reaction ",positive
" first of all let me preface this by stating that i literally just put this product on minutes ago. i have had a chemical peel over a week ago and was given retin a and therefore my face was peeling so horribly that i thought i couldn't leave the house. i mean my makeup would literally come right off. i was horrified! i tried several moisterizers sometimes multiple ones but could still see the skin flaking off onto my desk so i researched this and went to sephora and bought a kit. i washed my face did the serum and added this product and i honestly do not see 1 single flake of dry skin it does tingle but i think it's because my face is raw and so dry but it feels as if my skin is drinking it up like a cold glass of water. i am anxious to see what happens in the weeks to come. i have mild cyctic acne and have struggled with it for years. i decided to see a dermatolist and then got chemical peels it helped to rid me of the bad acne but then i was so dry for 2 wks i couldn't bare to even look at myself. my skin doesn't hurt anymore for allthe sensitive people there is a sensitve version but if you have dry skin from the crazy acne treatments they make us do or peels or just dry winter heat this is the product for you. if it seems strong then use it every other night until you skin can adapt. or just once a day. i hope you find this product helpful like i did becaus i am still looking in the mirrow that's at my desk ",positive
" best face cream ever but even though cosmetic mall .com had it for less the three week shipping and poor service from usps from china i'll pay the extra buck and get it from nordstom again next time ",positive
" fahrenheit by dior has a fragrance like no other... i've been fascinated by this fragrance ever since i can remember. it is bold and fragrant... generally people seem to either like it a lot or hate it. it seems a little overpowering at first but as i said you either like it or hate it. the fragrance is masculine no doubt and it's not something that i'd use in summer... essentially a night fragrance. ",positive
" lancome's juicy tubes in simmer tastes like my beverage of choice orange julius. when you apply it it feels like you're rubbing the tip of an orange creamsicle ice cream pop onto your lips (minus the cold minus the cream). the color is a very subtle pink-ish beige but it provides enough glossy shimmer to keep your lips a-simmer! this is my 4th tube of juicy (also a big fan of spring fling & berry bold) and so far this is my favorite flavor ",positive
" i used to use mac's glass lipgloss before juicy tubes were around. any time the wind blew i had hair stuck to the incredibly sticky gloss which as you know is extremely unpleasant and annoying. juicy tubes stays on but doesn't have the overly-sticky feeling which is wonderful. i don't wear much makeup and find juicy tubes to add that something special to a dewy face. i recommend daiquiri or berry bold for the most natural looks. daiquiri is more of a straightforward shine while berry bold gives you that red lipped childlike look we all used to have naturally. you will adore this gloss. i can't live without it ",positive
" oh my gosh! i love this lip gloss so much. i first bought one last year and it was the best item of makeup i've ever bought! it goes great over other lip gloss/lipstick or alone. all of the colors are great but i'd start our with pink first. my personal favorite is spring fling because it's not so bright but it's still juicy. you will deffinetly not regret buying one of these. it's worth every penny ",positive
" this nail polish is by far the best nail product i have ever purchased! i stumbled accross it in france two summers ago and have been dying to find it ever since. the brush is great depositing the polish smoothly and thinly the product dries quickly and lasts a long time. it is amazing ",positive

" my boyfriend has this cologne and i love it! it smells so good. even if he is wearing the deodorant and not the cologne it smells as if he was. it may be a little on the expensive side (not as expensive on amazon.com as macy's or other department stores) but it's well worth it. just be sure to correctly select the item you want because the picture shown is of the cologne ",positive
" if there is a better shaving cream out there i couldn't find it. i've not had any problems and a year later i'm still on my first purchase with about 40% left. fantastic stuff ",positive
" i love this stuff!! five months ago i was diagnosed with having ak's (actinic keratosis -- lesions that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma/ skin cancer). my dermatologist recommended i use skinceuticals ce ferulic every day as it prevents thymine dimers (dna mutations associated with skin cancer) with a medium exfoliator for a few months before taking more drastic measures to eradicate the ak's. my skin has never been healthier!! the lesions (which were scaly itchy and red) are healed and the overall apperance of my skin has improved dramatically and is much more even. my pores are smaller and i have a healthy glow. the ce ferulic also is packed with antioxidant protection to help fight free-radical damage and provides photoprotection. highly recommended for those with ak's uneven skin tone large pores or blemished or dull skin. love it love it love it!!! ",positive
" after hearing so many good things about philosophy's cinnamon buns i just had to try it out for myself. i found it to not really smell like cinnamon buns but more like water mixed with sugar. if you use it on your head it will leave a lingering smell but it won't last long on your body after taking a shower. i think this product is a nice way of treating yourself but i definitely do not think it smells like cinnamon buns which left me slightly disappointed. overall a great product ",positive
" i put this in a bathroom soap dispenser for christmas and it adds a nice touch during the holiday season. smells nice and lathers well ",positive
" i am a huge fan of the creme but not of this lip balm. for the price they want this should've been much much better. it goes on nice and has a neutral taste and moisturizes ok. my l'occitane lip balm or just plain shea butter does a much better job moisturizing my lips than this does. save your money and do not buy this. ",positive
" i have been searching for years for something to keep my lips from chapping and this is it. it's absolutely amazing better than anything i have tried and i have tried so many lip products. the lemon custard flavor is delicious too. put it on at night and in the morning your lips will be soft and smooth--this is the ultimate conditioner for your lips.

" i first got a whiff of blue in a magazine advertisement when it came out and it was love from that moment. i went out and purchased it and this is all i wear now. it is all i want to wear. nothing else compares to this for me. i get so many compliments! i had one coworker once who would walk by me just so he could smell it. he told me what he was doing of course he just loved the smell. people want to know what i am wearing and where they can purchase it. i feel great when i'm wearing it and i will keep using it as long as they will make it ",positive
" this is by far the most delicious scent ever no other perfume comes even close i use it everyday and it is worth every cent ",positive
" definitely a-must-have perfume! the smell is just awesome. not too strong...not too mild and stays for long. i strongly recommend this. it is also a great gift. ",positive
" this fragrance took me quite by surprise when i first tried it from a magazine sample so much so that i knew i had to try it at a department store - this was a little over a year ago. then i sampled it at a department store and all my nose could think was wow! - gardenias from my grandmother's garden the suntan oils & tropical perfumes that i smelled as a little girl at the beach with a few more florals blended in that make this fragrance even more exotic and sensual - i knew i had to have it! i bought myself a bathgel and lotion set and put the large bottle of cologne on my x-mas list which my sweet & generous boyfriend got for me. in my opinion this is probably the most alluring fragrance for women that i have ever smelled. i feel very alluring every time i wear it for my boyfriend - and he loves it! so this would be a great gift for a man's wife or girlfriend or for a woman's best friend sister or cousin (as long as you wear it for your own man too!) but a slightly awkward gift to give to your mother aunt or grandmother - it's that enticing. but if your single older relative or friend simply must have it as one of her gifts then have it given by one of her female friends sister cousin or santa. that way there won't be any awkwardness at gift-giving time. believe me - this fragrance is the olfactory equivalent of french lingerie or a string bikini!

" i absolutly love all of carol's daughter's products. everything to me is true to description. i recieved my almond cookie gift set in the mail and i couldnt wait to open it. the smell is to die for sometimes i open my shea souffle' just so i can smell it. i also love her labels and containers. i will forever be a customer of carol's daughter and i look forward to the day where i can walk into one of her stores. her prices are worth every dime. remember you get what you pay for ",positive
" i thank god for carol's daughter. i have finally found a quality product that makes me feel like i'm at the spa in my own home for a a resonable price. i rather pay $25.00 any day for spectacular service and a fantastic product any day than $10 so-so product filled with water and vaseline. i am a carols daughter member so are my kids and most of my family. kudos to lisa price for setting that much needed standard in the beauty industry.god bless you al ",positive
" this product is very well built. the mirrors are clear and free from any distortion. magnification level is just right. the only negative about this is the light is very dim and not adjustable ",positive
" the mirror was very easy to install. after using the mirror a couple weeks the plane and magnifying mirrors are very clear and easy to adjust to the correct distance for great viewing. the only negative is that the halo light does not provide sufficient brightness but not an issue if mirror is used in a well lighted area ",positive
" was very happy with the service of delivery and i use the mirror every day ",positive
" gone are the days of overpriced department store products that do absolutly nothing for your skin! gone are the days of spending too much money for a product that sits in your bathroom and collects dust! this is stuff is kick ass! if you are the type to buy a product that is endorced by a celebrity then you can be satisfied here and if you go to the mario badescu website you can see all the celebrities who have gone to the spa and used the products. if you are looking for a product that makes your skin feel clean and fresh without spending your paycheck then you have found the perfect company!!! i have been using the products from mario badescu for three years now and i have gotten my mom mother-in-law sister and other friends and family to become mario badescu junkies too. that all said if you want something to pamper yourself look no further. (try the seaweed soap and the orange protective cream. and if you have a problem with pimples then look for the drying lotion but beware its strong stuff. ",positive
" i love this product. i use it when my son spits up and it either goes on his face or body. sometimes it still stinks from the spit up after wiping with just a wipe so i pump a little of this on a wipe and it does the trick. i have various mustela products and they all work great ",positive
" i got this product as a gift at a baby shower and wasn't sure how i was going to use it--i was a little unclear as to exactly what it was. . .is it soap? (no) is it astringent? (no) what the heck is it? answer: it's a baby windex! i have used this going on 4 years and 2 babies. it removes any lingering stink from diaper changes cleans spit-up off skin and leaves a nice fresh scent removes macaroni and cheese and chee-tos from hands and faces not to mention kool-aid chocolate spaghetti sauce residue. . .you name it physiobebe cleans it up. just pump some onto a cotton pad wipe or napkin and clean off your kid. i highly recommend it ",positive
" this is a fabulous product. i use the whole mustela line. this is great for sponge bathing when your newborn arrives home. i also use it on a cotton ball after baths to make sure my baby is extra clean. this is great for helping babies complexion ",positive
" i love this product! i look forward to the end of the day knowing that i can soothe my tired feet with fair trade foot lotion! i've seen this product work wonders prior to this purchase--when my husband was in the army his feet were extremley worn and torn when he came home from iraq--after using this product for several days his feet looked and felt brand new ",positive
" i actually got a sample from the lush store in san francisco and just tried it-it's fabulous on my cracked and peeling heels ",positive
" this is my all-time favorite perfume bar none! i get millions of compliments when i wear it; most people think it smells like baking cookies or marshmallows - but not a little girl scent - definitely a grown up girl scent. men love it because it smells like food - a definite turn on! lol :) you truly cannot go wrong with this perfume it is absolutely faboo ",positive
" the bottle itself is a real looker with thick rich smooth glass encasing golden rich amber jewel like liquid on the inside. fancy shmancy i said as i took it out of the delivery box. i opened the bottle to take a whiff and my oh my it's definitely worth the price tag. the real test of course came at bath time and this sure delivered beyond looks alone. the bath water turned bubbly and luscious with earthy aromas of warm primrose vanilla and the rich juicy and creamy finish of the apricot. this should be eaten not bathed in! insanely delicious as it would make a wonderful present for any friend or relative but better yet for yourself. apparently this can be used as a body wash and i am really looking forward to using it in the shower as i'm a shower person in the morning and this would make a tantalizing shower experience for sure. i have reviewed a few of these bath items today and now i feel so sweet and sleepy after my bath that i feel extremely happy for getting this bubble bath. it's little delectable products such as this one that bring you calm and pleasantness after a long day and nothing can replace some nice relaxation alone in the tub. even my boyfriend loved the scent as he used it the other day so it can be for both men and women but i might have to hide it in case he secretly likes it too much! ",positive
" i purchased this product over the summer 2006 when i became concerned about sun damage. my only question about this product is whether the vitamin c in it is stable (i.e. should the product be refrigerated to maintain its potency?). regardless it has a sufficient amount of vitamin c for the product to be worthwhile (10% - woo hoo!) and other vitamin c creams are much more expensive. the nice thing about this product is that a little really does go a long way. you squeeze a small amount onto your finger (hygienic packaging!) and spread onto your face. as the product spreads it absorbs and has a silky finish. i'm not sure why but i have taken to mixing this product with a little bit of cetaphil moisturizer and i love the result. it does have an orangey citrus smell but i am not bothered by it (which is rare). ",positive
" this is a great finisher - use after you've drenched your hair with leave-in conditioner and focus on the ends which tend to spread out and fly away and the little wispies at your temple and nape. smells great but doesn't compete with the smell of other products. only con: a little bit does not go a long way. it's expensive to stock up ",positive
" for a mirror shine and one that doesn't disappear on the rim of a glass with the first sip my choice is mac. lipglass feels good on your lips as if it contained some emollients. and (this is a big and) it's not tacky or sticky. the colors are a veritable palette of shades to suit every mood occasion and skin tone. they range from a playfully innocent baby-doll nude to a dramatic dark diva red. another plus (and this is a big plus following the big and) mac lipglass is so price accessible that you can easily pick a bouquet of these delicious shades. try adding a lipglass over a country cousin lipstick for a wow impact. enjoy! ",positive
" mac lipglass is the absolute best. there are plenty of colors to choose from super-shiny and the gloss is thick stays on and doesn't run. the best colors are.... nico for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine. oystergirl is a shimmery baby pink. oh baby is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick. chai looks amazing with black smokey eyes. it's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine ",positive

" i'm really anal about scented/flavored lipglosses- especially ones scented or flavored with vanilla but mac lipglass isn't that vanilla-ish at all! it's got very pigmented color it stays on a long time for a gloss and each tube lasts a long time... don't let what the other reviewer said about the vanilla scent throw you off ",positive
" i reach for ck one on days that i want a crisp fresh scent. intended to be a unisex fragrance it is not at all sweet or flowery. however it does have a softness to it that i personally believe makes it better suited to a woman than a man; i find it to be slightly musky without being masculine. overall this is a really nice neutral fragrance for everyday wear ",positive
" ck1 is a very nice toilette spray. it has a very good smell to it.i gave it as a gift and now i am going to have to purchase it for me to ",positive
" i love this perfume it's the best that i have in my collection. it's not too strong but it's enough for everyone to notice. i practically wear it everyday and this size will usually last for a while ",positive
" this is an amazingly fresh fragrance...it's a light lush and sparkling floral-fruity blend. a lot of people asked me what i was wearing. i highly recommend it for someone looking for a nice scent that they can wear all day. ",positive
" i use both this mascara and lancome flextencils when i'm going out flextencils first then coat with hypnose. my lashes look huge and not too clumpy. flextencils add great length while hypnose adds volume. i use hypnose by itself on just an average day. great product! makes my lashes big and not clump ",positive
" i've always used lancome mascaras before hypnose i used denfincils. hypnose is a great mascara. never clumps the non-waterproof version is easily removable and your lashes look amazing. definately give this product a try ",positive
" so far this is the best thickening mascara i have tried that are either sold in drug stores or at department stores. it is not sticky or gloppy and you won't look like tammy fay with spider lashes. i do however have to apply two coats to bring out the more sparse areas of my lashes but i have finally stopped my search for thickening mascaras. my journey ends here ",positive
" tried and true might well describe the products offered by caswell-massey as generations have relied upon them for both quality and efficacy. established in 1752 it's america's oldest chemist and perfumer. my grandmother enjoyed their products and i do too. their almond & aloe liquid soap is a boon because it not only cleanses well but moisturizes as it does so. far too many soaps leave skin feeling dry and itchy. almond as we know has a lovely distinctive fragrance as well as skin softening properties. combine it with aloe which contains healing properties and you have a uniquely beneficial cleanser. other ingredients include vitamins a and d for nourishment. this soap is particularly useful for those who wash their hands frequently during the day and for those with normal to dry or sensitive skin. other items in caswell-massey's almond & aloe line include body balm bath seltzer cold cream soap hand cream hand & body emulsion and almond body splash ",positive
" this bath melt was nice. it smelled great but it is pretty sweet. it didn't do anything spectacular to the water just kind of made it look soapy. the melt took it's time melting and the smell lasted throughout the bath. i took the melt after it sat in the water for a while and rubbed it directly on my skin which made my skin smell nice. it also moisturizes well and makes the water feel smooth and silky but the smell didn't linger on my skin once i was out of the water ",positive
" if you haven't tried lush or creamy candy do it! creamy candy smells delicious and leaves your skin silky soft. for soap to match try rock star. mmmmm!!! i can't place the fragrance; it's cherry but not cotton candy but not - it's very sweet smelling and the scent lasts and lasts. enjoy ",positive
" this is the best micro peel i have ever tried! the thing i noticed first was that when i applied when hope is not enough and the present they went on so smoothly. they absorbed equally. in my mid-30's my young skin is fading but this really brought it back. i won't say i am 19 again but i am sure the difference is obvious. i am a hairstylist and my customers have been making mention of how great my skin looks since i added this to my bag of tricks. it is a lot more effective that i would have thought and i have not had a microdermabrasion since i started using this 2-4 times per month ",positive
" i love love this product. i can't believe how much i actually used it; i ran out of my box within two months! all those tops that have a wide open neck needed the bra strap to sit on the edge of my shoulder--this kept my straps in place all day and night! a few of my work tops have buttons that stop short towards the bottom; i use the strips to close the flap in place so it's smooth all the way down. tip: in some cases i cut the strips in half; even half a strip holds my bra straps in place. this product holds things in place or down it does not lift and hold--its not ducked tape. ",positive
" the powder/foundation is excellent for skin which is oily and large-pored. it is one of the best around for no-caking no-oil smooth surface skin. if you can't stand the feel of cream or lotion foundations chanel does it best!! also my seller was terrific ",positive
" i love this foundation. it is a easy one step process. i don't like to use liquid. i need something easy quick and foolproof. i am always in a hurry with 3 kids i don't have time for multi steps. i also have acne and red cheeks. this evens out my skin and covers my acne. my skin looks flawless. i have tried so many products including mac bare minerals lancome origins shiseido etc.. my only problem with this makeup is... it is so expensive. what do you expect it's chanel. pure perfection ",positive
" i absolutely love this kit. it keeps my dry slightly acne prone skin so soft smooth & blemish free (for the most part). i use both everyday along with an intense moisturizer & my complexion has improved greatly ",positive
" i absolutely love this kit. i love that i can use the great mystery every morning and it isn't harsh on my skin and i love using the greatest love at night and when i wash it off it just melts into my skin i don't even have to put on a moisturizer. for something really nice try using the great mystery and then put the greatest love on top of that. it's really amazing. the only caution i would have is when using the greatest love don't rub it in you have to massage it very lightly otherwise it will irritate your skin and can cause breakouts or make you feel like you have a sun burn.

" i suffered from a severe case of shingles that affected the right side of my face. the infection left scars on half of my face. i started using the exfoliate kit regularly. after four months my face now looks normal and i'm able to go without makeup again. thanks philosophy ",positive
" best skin care line i have ever used. frequent air travel wrecked havoc on my skin and the exfoliate kit revealed a complexion i never knew i had. i'm currently using other philosophy products and have recommended them to family and friends. ",positive

" i absolutely adore this scent! it certainly is not just for men! anyone who loves the smell of limes will love this! the sea salt is amazing! i literally haven't been able to use any other soap since discovering it two years ago and i used to be a body wash person! never again! give it a try! it'll wake you right up in the morning and keep your energy high ",positive
" this is such a nice lightweight conditioner. and makes my hair smell super clean and fresh ",positive
" i have been using this product for years. i have a really oily t-zone and i find that this product keeps it in control. it is a very good cleanser that removes the oil without drying your skin. no matter what color your skin tone may be i think you will like this product! ",positive
" product works well. it's a whole lot better than using your fingers = ",positive
" this product is absolutely brilliant. in the past i have always had to go to the bathroom and blot with tissues and get my powder and puff out. taking too long. plus ending up with a cake face as the day goes on. with these powder papers i can do it anytime discreetly without having to use a mirror or a puff. just a fresher face with a slight dusting of powder. perfect ",positive
" terrific for the area around the eyes. gets rid of dryness and doesn't sting the eyes or feel greasy. ",positive
" about 10 years ago i began getting ingrown whiskers on my neck from shaving. not only did they not feel good (they'd itch and were sensitive) but they looked horrible. the front of my neck was red and i would have horrible red and white bumps all over the skin where whiskers would curl and grow back down into the skin. i was totally self concsious because it looked horrible. the only thing i could for the longest time was pluck them with tweezers. that took a lot of time and digging into my skin to pull the hairs was very uncomfortable and really didn't work that well. i tried switching to an electric razor with little success. i could not have a close shave on my neck without getting the horrible ingrown hairs. i searched the web for months to try and find something that would work. i found some advice for a few different things but none worked. i finally ran across a website of a distributor that was selling tend skin. by that point i wasn't sure anything would work but i was desperate for something so i bought it. i am so glad i did. it really works when you use it as directed and you see results by the time you have to shave again. i apply tend skin with a cotton ball or pad to my neck after i shave and dry my face. i will then apply it again in the evening and repeat each morning and night. it does not take much at all. i always buy the largest bottle for fear that one day tend skin will disappear! if you have ingrown facial hair from shaving you need to get this. it is the only thing that i have found the works and i am 100% happy with it. it is rather pricey but i never hesitate to buy because it is worth every penny to me. the only small complaint i have about it is that it smells just a tad funny to me. my wife says it smells fine to her so i don't worry about it. i wonder if they could make it with a slightly nicer smell - or none at all. it really doesn't matter though because tend skin is awesome and i don't know what i'd do without it. i can't speak to how effective it is for ingrown leg hair etc. but i would imagine it would work the same ",positive
" i have used tend skin for around three years now for razor bumps on the bikini line. before i started using it i had tried everything else and resigned to the fact that i'd always be stuck with bumps along the bikini line. a friend of mine told me about tend skin and swore by it so i bought a small bottle. it seemed like it was expensive but that first bottle lasted well over 6 months. it does smell like alcohol at first but the smell goes away when it dries. as far as the other reviews on here i've only had stinging when i used it immediately after shaving...i think b/c the pores were still open from the shower. for me it's been a skin saver when i'd already given up the search. i hope that the negative reviews on here don't discourage people from trying it. everyone's skin reacts somewhat differently. of the millions of bottles of tend skin sold every year i think the half dozen people on here who didn't like it are the few unhappy rarities not the average who like me thank goodness it's around. ",positive
" this cream cleanser is wonderful! i have used the clinique 3 step program since i was a teenager until i went to an at home body shop party and tried this cleanser. i have been using it ever since. it is so soft and creamy feels great going on my skin and leaves it feeling clean smooth and moisturized. its great at gently removing make-up in the evenings and is a nice pick me up first thing in the mornings ",positive
" this fun fragrance comes across to me as soft and slightly sweet with a feel that's both young and a bit sexy. the scent is quite pretty with a bit of floral and the lightness of it makes it a perfect everyday scent (although it works well for romance too!). as mentioned above the scent does have a youthful fresh feel to it and although i've heard some say that the fragrance is best for teens i'm almost 40 and i enjoy it on days that i'm looking for something lighthearted and fun (granted i probably wouldn't wear it everyday). lucky you comes in a cute pink bottle with a unique rubber stopper and it has good staying power although the scent grows more subtle over time. recommended for women of all ages who are young at heart ",positive
" this is a very suttle fragrance that lasts for hours. slightly floralhowever is a very intimate scent most people need to get very close to notice which can be good but also a sign that you need to spray yourself all over. i would recommend picking this up if you want something to carry around in your purse to spray here and there. it last for hours but is not an all day perfume ",positive
" i bought this perfume about one year ago with a gift certificate. i was skeptical about purchasing perfume online but i was not dissapointed. this perfume is absolutely fabulous! when you first put it on the floral freshness and ruby grapefruit awakens your senses as the top notes. the middle notes included a powdery musk that is sensual yet not to woodsy. and the bottom notes of jasmine are so graceful yet grasping. buy this perfume. you will fall in love with it ",positive
" i love this perfume. it has been my signature everyday scent for several years now. alot of people ask what you are wearing because it smells so good... and guys love it too ",positive
" of all the higher end mascaras i've tried this one is by far the best. your lashes look longer and thicker with just one coat and looks like natural great lashes not made up. the creamy gel formula goes on smooth never clumps or feels sticky-and true to form your lashes will curl up nicely. although not a water proof mascara it has incredible staying power cleans off easily. i love this mascara won't look elsewhere ",positive
" i have this product working in my hair right now. it is simply wonderful! first off it smells like lovely victorian rosebud-almond pudding. it has a similar consistency. i can get about three to four uses from each container and i have very thick hair. my hair was preciously quite dry and abused. i had dyed it twice in the last six months. after one use of this product my hair felt better than it had in years. silky strong and shiny. i love this product! i highly recommend it. ",positive
" i've been a fan of this product for a couple of years since i have very long wavy hair. it moisturizes really well and i use it every ten days or so. it smells like a weird salad dressing when you put it on kind of vinegary and spicy but when you wash it out the scent is toned down a bit. it still smells unusual (spicy and vaguely nutty) but not unpleasant. i warm a good handful of this in the microwave put it on my dry hair and tie it in a bun wait 20 minutes then shampoo it out using a liquid shampoo and condition with a light conditioner like coolaulin or a small amount of american cream. if you have short hair you probably won't need this deep of a treatment but for those of us with a lot of hair or who have damaged or very thick hair it is great. it makes my hair shiny and tangle-free again. it doesn't have any of the silicones that commercial conditioners have so if you are looking for that slick feeling you get from pantene you won't find it here. but the ingredients in this don't build up in your hair the way silicones do so for those of us who are making a conscious choice to avoid silicone buildup in our hair this is a great deep conditioner ",positive
" hsuan wen hua hair treatment is one of the best hair treatments i've come across... and i'm a huge hair junkie and have tried many things. ever since finding lush several months ago i have not even touched another brand of hair care. hsuan wen hua hair treatment is made with fresh ingredients like bananas avocadoes and fresh olive oil. you use this before you wash your hair so apply it to dry hair. i usually put my hair up in a pony tail and only do the ends because that's where the damage is. then i twist my hair up in a bun and rubberband a plastic bag over it. i try to leave it on as long as i can (overnight if i'm lucky) shampoo my hair and condition like regular after. because this is a treatment and not so much a hair conditioner you still need to use a seperate conditioner. the results are amazing and my hair is so much softer and in such better condition after use. since i only do the ends it's easy to feel the difference between the ends of my hair that was treated and the rest of my hair that was not. hsuan wen hua hair treatment is a m-u-s-t for my hair regime. definately recommended ",positive
" this treatment works extremely well! i looked on here and saw that there were no extrememly helpful reviews so i decided to write one. i have long golden untreated hair. however it was as dry as straw so i decided to try this. here how it is: the smell is amazing (it smells like pumpkin pie or gingerbread cookies) after use the hair looks soft and shiny however it makes hair flat. this product is a deep moisturizer therefore the hair does not have any pouf to it. it is still worth the money though! rehydration of the hair is supremely important and this rehydrates well. just after shampooing do not use a conditioner (unless that just doesn't work well for you) which helps the flatness. a few helpful tips: 1. this goes on dry hair 2. after putting lots of this treatment on try putting a bag over your hair and keeping it shut with a clip. the heat that your head produces allows the hair cuticles to open and fully absorb the treatment. this works 2xs better than lush's intstructions (my mother is a hairstylist). 3. leave the bag tight around your head for 20 to 40 minutes 4. afterwards shampoo like normal but i still recommend not using a conditioner for that day. hopefully this helps anyone with questions. this really is an amazing product and should be used about twice a month (more if you'd like but that's probably not necessary). enjoy your beatiful shiny hair! ",positive
" i love this product. my eye brows are growing but not all over in the areas where i'm putting the product. the hair has become darker but nothing extreme just in a way where i'm able to see it now (i'm naturally a toehead). i would recommend this to others but i'm saddened that it's so hard to find and i was unable to do so in a store ",positive
" i love this shampoo. my husband bought it but i definitely use it more than he does:) anyway it smells amazing and really works well with my unruly hair ",positive
" i am a fan of ralph lauren and check new products from this brand. i liked this scent although i am probably more used to polo blue which is also great. it is better to get an idea in a store because it is not quite possible to decide from reviews. anyway it is worth checking especially if you are looking for a new cologne for st. valentine's day ",positive
" at first spray this can be a pretty potent cologne but after 1-2 minutes this fades into a nice rosey spice scent that is much lighter than it's green original polo brother. lasts all day long and into the night. worth checking out if you are a fan of cool water and lotto or lighter scented cologne. ",positive
" if you like the citrusy scent of other fresh products (as i do) then you will probably really like this lip balm. it has a lovely lemony taste and a soft smooth texture. it's not waxy or greasy and my husband likes to kiss me when i have it on! the only reason that i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it doesn't last as long as i'd like. my lips tend to get pretty chapped in the winter and i put balm on at night to condition my lips. this one is gone after about 30 minutes to an hour so i need a much more concentrated lip balm (like bliss balm) for night use. but if you're looking for a light yummy balm this might be it ",positive
" this has to be by far one of the best lip treatments on the market. pricy...yes. but well worth every cent. in as few as two uses my lips have gone from cracked to whole. tastes as good as it smells. lemon...brownsugar..like the body scrub of the same name. my only complaint: it doesn't have the longevity of say prada's lip balm (which i use when running) ",positive
" i love these inserts! i had trouble finding ones this size. not too big not too small. they definitely help me to fill out my bras! i would suggest putting them in bras with pockets for inserts. i tried just setting these in my bra but if i moved my arms up and my bra moved around i was afraid that the cupcakes would fall out. these are a great product though ",positive
" lipstick going. this review is for the guava stain shade. i first bought this lipstick i believe in the mid to late eighties. i was delighted with it then and am now. it is sheer light non greasy and the color never changes. the color is not neutral but i find that i can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade i wear. i would buy different brandsdifferent shades and wear them maybe once then back to guava stain. it along with clinque's soft pressed blush in new clover orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites and the one's i reach for time and again. they are my dependables. daytime wear for sure not night this is a subtle sheer color ",positive
" this is a great item from lush. it works so well lasts a very long time and is worth every penny. first off the scent. it is dead-on fresh coconut. not the fake sun tan oil/beach smell you'd expect. it makes a ton of creamy thick lather with only a few swipes through (soaking) wet hair. it cleasnes really well and rinses clean. for me there was no residue left behind only softness. as i said it does last for ages but you have to make sure you leave it in a well ventilated soap dish with a drain. if it's left in water say goodbye to it in a couple of days as you will be left with a mushy mess half the size of when you left it. try it at least once if it doesn't work for your hair... it's also great to shave with ",positive
" but it definitally did not work as it was intended. it is intended to moisturize hair. i have long fine oily hair and i received trichomania as a gift. i love the smell but when i first used it it left my hair very dry which i consider a good thing considering the state of my hair. it just didnt do what it was supposed to. however if you have really oily hair this is the thing for you. no problems with lathering either especally if you rub the bar in your hair not in your hands. doesnt leave white flakes either ",positive
" if you have dry hair trichomania is for you. it smells like real coconuts not that synthetic crap in suntan lotions and works wonders on my dry colored and generally abused hair. plus it lasts forever. all of lush's solid haircare lasts much longer than bottled stuff and contains no silicones. they do take some getting used to but once you adjust everything else will smell so chemical and you'll wonder why you ever used them. ",positive
" i've tried several eye shaddow bases including laura mercier and find the laura geller eye spackle to last the longest. i generally have my makeup on by 6:00am and keep in on until 9:30 pm. it looks as great at night as it did in the morning. i definitely recommend this product ",positive
" i first smelled this perfume on a colleague of mine about a year ago. every time she walked by me i got a whiff of this heavenly scent that she wore nearly every day. so i finally stopped her and asked what she was wearing. i'd never heard of it so i jumped online and looked it up found a bottle and bought it. i couldn't wait to try it out so when the perfume finally arrived i put it right on. imagine my disappointment when i smelled a scent totally unlike the one i'd experienced. on me it was overpoweringly musky nothing like the seductive fragrance i'd smelled on my colleague. but an odd thing happened. i didn't wash it right off and when i smelled it again about 30 minutes later it had become the alluringly sensual perfume i'd fallen in love with. in fact the longer i wore it the better it smelled. obviously it depends on your body chemistry to achieve it's bloom. now i wear it when i go out in the evenings and people comment on how wonderfully sexy it smells. if you buy this perfume don't judge it too quickly as i did....give it a little time and you're sure to love it. you only need to use a little and it lasts for hours. ",positive
" this is the best perfume that i have ever used. i tried estee lauder lancome and i always come back to paloma. the scent is wonderful and it stays on your clothes for a long time. buy it today ",positive
" works exceptionally well. clears pimple faster than other types of treatments i have used and reduces the redness very quickly. my 2 teenage daughters love the product as well. because such a small amount is needed a tube will last a long time. will definitely buy it again! ",positive
" murad acne spot treatment really works to drive away those unsightly blemishes! it heals even the big nasty pimples in a few days with the smaller ones healing in hours. it really does help to minimize the appearance of most acne after i apply it too. overall i would say it is a great produce for anyone who like me considers even minor acne to be a major annoyance ",positive
" i love this portable perfume...it's really sleek and easy to carry around to reapply. the smell is delicious and it leaves a nice shimmery sheen on your skin ",positive
" i have very fine hair and this is one products that thickens without weighing the hair down. it leaves hair soft not stiff yet easy to style and keep the hold ",positive
" i have this lip gloss in sweetie and will be trying other shades. i am very pleased with it! i wear it over stay-on type lip colors in other brands and it keeps my color on all day (even after eating)! it doesn't really feel too sticky if you blot after application. i only wish it tasted as good as it smells (not that it tastes bad it's just blah)! ",positive
" i love this lip gloss the cake batter taste/smell is totally addictive. the colors are lacking though all of the colors are light very sheer shades. i bought the color babydoll which is a light pink. it goes on sheer and i love the smooth texture too. this product is supposed to have glitter in it but i didnt' notice any and/or its not too glaring which makes it fine for me to wear it at work.

" i am a true believer in the phrase if it is not broke dont fix it. its hard to improve on perfection keep up the good work. until next time ! mike michalsk ",positive
" these bristles have just the right combination of softness and strength. however since i only use this as a back scrub brush the detachable design is not optimal for me. after a few months the brush-handle attachment point became compromised (probably from all the exposure to water) and i found that the brush would often detach from the handle as i scrubbed my back. at this point many more months down the road the brush no longer stays mounted to the handle at all so i am looking for a (non-detachable) replacement. even so i recommend this product because of it's great bristles and also because the handle was great while it lasted. ",positive
" the tounge-and grove way the handle detached make it easy to use in the shower (dont have my glasses on). the detachable brush has medium soft bristles and will be easy on the skin. the strap on the brush is cotton so this probably isn't a once-in-a lifetime purchase but very good for the price. everybody needs one ",positive
" the wipes work well; they do not irritate my daughter's face. but they stink!!!!! i usually use them before she goes to bed so that i don't have to smell her skin as it makes me nauseous ",positive
" great iron and its purple! heats up fast stays hot variable hotness levels..great i own this and the next size up and love them both ",positive
" l'occitane's lavender harvest matte face lotion *really works* to mattify oil and makes a nice makeup primer. i don't have oily skin but tried some samples over a night serum i was using with avocado oil to mattify it so my face wouldn't be greasy on my pillow. it left my skin feeling satiny and smooth. avocado is one of the heavier thicker oils and did wonders for my dry skin but i hated the feel of it so finding this was a real bonus to fix that problem. lavender oil also has relaxing aromatherapeutic properties is a natural antiseptic which helps prevent blemishes and mosquitoes don't like it so if you have oily skin and live in a humid climate in the summer you should try this! note: i have had good luck shopping with l'occitane through amazon but called first to make sure what i was ordering was in stock on their website.

" this is the only fragrance i have found that truly smells tropical. this is my boyfriends favorite scent and he thinks all perfumes stink. the four stars is because it takes this spray awhile to go from greasy and oily to dry. you have to wait awhile before you get dressed. but it smells great ",positive
" mistral as many know is a powerful gusty wind that blows across the south of france. mistral as i was happy to discover is also the name of a line of bath and body products all french inspired all lusciously lovely from scented soaps to soothing lotions to rejuvenating body butters. matthew tilker founder and president of mistral utilizes shea butter which is an efficacious natural healer in a myriad of must-have forms. derived from the nuts of the african shea tree (according to sacred custom the nuts are harvested primarily by women) this butter is highly emollient a boon for those with dry skin chapped lips any number of skin irritations. the pure shea butter soap comes in a plethora of inviting fragrances all milled six times (while others boast being triple milled). south seas is a particular favorite - it's as fresh as an ocean breeze and as calming soothing as a tropical island. the marine scent is accented with a touch of grapefruit white flowers and soft woods. an irresistible combination. south seas is a fragrance with which you wish to surround yourself - made possible by the shower gel body lotion massage bath and body oil bath salts and candle all available at very accessible prices. - gail cooke ",positive
" this is very good soap however it's too expensive to buy on a regular basis unless you are rich. very good quality though and i would buy it again if i had some money ",positive
" i have searched far & wide for a product that aids in the treatment/management of keratosis pilaris (little red bumps on the backs of my arms). it is estimated that 40-50% of the population has a form of keratosis pilaris and there is no cure for the skin condition. however this neostrata aha 8 significantly reduced bumps and redness after only 2 weeks. after 4 weeks it had almost vanished. the only drawback is that after 2-3 weeks of non-use the bumps tend to resurface. but if you keep the application up the bumps stay away! i use it religiously over the summer or if i have any upcoming special occasions where i want to look my best. i found the product in self magazine suggesting its use for keratosis pilaris management and have nothing but rave reviews!! finally something that works ",positive
" although this is supposed to be used as a deep conditioning treatment i used it several times a week and loved the way it made my hair look and feel. only drawback is the price and the container which you have to be very careful with in the shower! but all in all it's a wonderful product for fine hair and i've come back to it again and again!

" i've been using this kit for several weeks now and i am absolutely amazed at the results! i've had severe acne scarring due to a birth control pill i was taking. they were bright red and no concealer on the market would cover them. after one week of using murad i've noticed the scars fading! i thought nothing on this planet would fade them but murad is! i've also been blessed with good genes in having oily skin. murad drastically reduces the amount of shine i have. i highly recommend this product to everyone ",positive
" this product made my skin look absolutely great! i use it twice a day and within one week i saw a huge difference. i've been now using murad for a month and the improvement is astonishing. i get compliments on my skin every day. i highly recommend it ",positive
" i've been using murad for about 3 weeks now and it has made a huge difference! i am in my early 20's and have had problems with mild breakouts since my teens. i've tried drugstore products wich never seemed to make any difference and proactive which was so harsh it actually burned and made my skin much worse. murad is gentle enough for me to use twice a day and has left my skin breakout free! it has also improved the texture and feel of my skin and makes my pores nearly invisible. i recomend murad to anyone whose skin is breakout prone but too sensitive for the benzoyle peroxide formulas in other acne products. the only complaint i have about murad is the price - it can be a little much for a poor college student - but the results are worth it if you can afford it! ",positive
" yes i've had murad for about 2 weeks now and i've seen huge improvement! murad is a godsend! anyways... i was just wondering if the kit is really supposed to last me 2 months? i use it every morning and night. thats 120 times! umm... dont know if im gonna have any left... i know for sure the cleanser i will. (step 1) but steps 2 and 3 are very small quantity... and hopefully i wont need a lot of acne spot treatment usage cause they'll be all gone :) i definately recommend murad to everyone. like others i've tried proactiv but murad seems to work better with my skin. just try the one month starter kit first ",positive
" i discovered the murad acne complex kit about six years ago and have been using it since... it cleared my acne up within weeks and has kept the acne away. some products i tried dried my skin out but murad acne complex leaves it feeling clean and hydrated without all the chemical smells. i recommend anyone with acne try murad acne complex to see if it will work as well for you. ",positive
" i love this product. it takes only a few drops to make my hair shine. it is light smells quite nice and is not at all overpowering or strong smelling. i don't buy cheap fragrances so i don't know what bad perfumes reviewer nycoleb is comparing this with. i suppose everyone's body chemistry is different. i haven't found any other product that does what this does so i'll be buying another bottle when this one is done ",positive
" i was amazed by the quality of this product when i first purchased it in the summer of 2006. it gives my hair a perfect sheen and softness that i have never achieved with such lightweight hair oil before and my hair has acheive lengths that i have not seen in years! tui hair oil has a beautiful scent which does not change over the course of wearing it in your hair for a day or two or even longer if you wish.
