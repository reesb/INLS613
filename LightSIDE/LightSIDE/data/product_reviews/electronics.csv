" pros: perfect sound solved resampling issues cons: famous popping/crackling noises makes it useless for gaming especially in bf2 (which use openal by creative). crystallizer is useless. this card has the most advanced sound processor which does not work on at least 20% of high end systems not only nvidia nforce 4 chipset but also with other amd and intel cpu motherboards: see google for x-fi popping/crackling. even if you do not have in game crackling immediately you have a good chance to get it after any memory or hd upgrade or driver configuration change. for long time creative denied existence of this problem. eventually it was recognized (see official cl forums) and a new driver (since november 2005!) was promised at the end of may 2006 but beta version published 05/30/06 did not solve my problem. in the case of old audigy 2 zs the problem was solved with unofficial hacked drivers. i suspect that x-fi crackling is an architecture design flow which cannot be completely solved at software level because pci bus cannot provide sufficient memory access for the the fastest sound processor simultaneously with high end graphic card hd controller and other devices. bottom end: i have to stop playing games or go back to low quality integrated sound. do not take risk wait for working drivers or buy a working card from different manufacturer. with fixed drivers i would give this card 4 or 5 stars. update 06/12/2006 i found that many desktop motherboards (mb) have really slow south bridge (south bridge is connecting pci usb firewire and hd to cpu directly or through north bridge) especially mbs with nvidia chipsets (and even with some intel mbs). new beta x-fi driver and mb bios updates solved the problem in many cases (but not for my mb asrock k8nf4g-sata2 nvidia 6100 / 410 mcp chipset) but situation is still marginal and x-fi might go unstable again. i contact cl customer service they did not solved the problem but pointed out that ati chipsets (athlon 64 ati 200 or 3200) have no problems with x-fi. i decided not to return sb to seller but save it for a new computer with ati based mb. i guess that majority of workstation class mbs with upscale south bridge and pci-x (even nvidia based) also should be fine with x-fi. the trouble is that majority of x-fi buyers have generic nvidia based mbs like me. so i can give x-fi two stars instead of 1 (but i cannot change the rating) and even more stars if it will work well in my new computer of after new driver release (if it will work) ",negative
" about three years ago maybe four i bought two lexar cfii cards. one never worked the other worked but lost all data. i wrote to lexar that i had two bad cards they sent me one new card of the same size. i gave that to my girlfriend & told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. i still have my card in a ziplock. none of the file removal programs will get the images off & i've used all of them & had their (file removal) tech help give up. in this day & age of just make the item i am upset. but you take your chances. do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a lexar? i wouldn't i use an actual sandisk card myself. if they ever (lexar) made it right i may have written a better review but they haven't. so that tells me that they don't care. how important are your pictures to you? frederic ",negative
" consider another receiver before buying delorme's. delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard unlike most other receivers.) the delorme software itself is not very accurate. just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home i found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. finally with the receiver i have even after the device as been initialized delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it.

" i use this in conjunction with the sandisk ultra ii 2.0 gb compact flash card. i like it but the flash card doesn't slide in easily. sometimes it get stuck halfway as if the unit has not been designed properly and the sliders for the card offer enough give to slide the card to the left or right of the pins. to add insult to injury both the reader and flash card are manufactured by sandisk. therefore they should work seamlessly together but pathetically they don't. i'd much rather pay more for a reader that worked great rather than save a few dollars for a reader that makes you work every time you use the thing. for comparison my camera accepts the card perfectly. there is no give at all but instead is an effortless process. not a quality reader. other than that it works as expected. surprisingly the reader doesn't topple over as easily as i thought it would. it stands vertically and looks like it might fall over when trying to slide the card in. sliding the card in a 2 handed process so one hand holds the unit while the other slides it in. removing the card is extremely easy. that's a one-handed process. eject the card from the pc's drive and then remove it. data transfer from the card to pc is very quick. overall i'm glad to have it but it's an annoyance to use it. i hate the card getting stuck halfway in the reader ",negative

" i bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it. the first unit i received would not turn on at all. i contacted philips' tech support and their solution was for me to send the brand new defective stereo back to them at my expense. fortunately amazon has a very nice return policy and i sent it back to them instead. amazon was also very nice in sending a replacement right away without waiting until they received the defective unit. the replacement stereo arrived in short order and i was immediately disappointed in the sound quality which didn't seem as good as the 15 year old cassette player boombox that i was replacing. after listening to the stereo for a few days and comparing it to a sony cmt-ne3 bookshelf stereo that i own here are my thoughts. 1. the fm reception is not as good as the cmt-ne3. both units have a thin wire type of antenna and both wires are about the same length. the philips stereo however would hiss and crackle as i moved around the room - my body interfered with the reception. this did not happen with the sony stereo. 2. the sound quality is not as good as the cmt-ne3. playing the same song side-by-side on the two stereos i found that the philips stereo had a flat tinny sound when compared to the cmt-ne3. the sony system had a much fuller and richer sound quality. also there seemed to be significant distortion in the high-frequencies on the philips stereo making s sounds sound more like h sounds. i also noticed an occasional crackle of distortion in the overall sound possibly due to a bad connector on the aux input. 3. the ergonomics of the philips stereo are not so good. for one thing the stereo will easily tip over forwards if accidentally bumped. if that happens the cd can get wedged in the cd tray and it becomes almost impossible to remove. the electronically actuated cd door is much more likely to break than a passive mechanical door like the top-loading cmt-ne3. the volume goes up to 31 or so but 5 is about as loud as you would need it for regular listening. this means that there are only 4 quieter volume levels which is rather limiting. finally the stereo is a bit bigger than i was expecting (though i could have looked more closely at the specs when buying it). i am in the process of returning this stereo and i will try to find a sony system instead. unfortunately amazon no longer sells the cmt-ne3 which i bought just about a year ago. i don't understand why electronics manufacturers feel the need to churn their product lines so rapidly. is there really that much innovation in bookshelf stereos? the only difference between the sony i bought last year and one i bought in 1989 is the ability to play mp3 cds.

" i have to rate this product and this company as horrible!! i purchased the x2 in 12/2004. everything was fine. in 6/2005 the lamp blew. less than 300 hours on it!!! i called the company. they said sometimes it happens. i questioned the projector. they said i just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh you can only get the lamps from them. you can only get service on the x2 from them. i get the new lamp. it just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. additionally the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was still under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) no. they say no. the projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. the projector was blown clean on a regular basis. this projector was not mistreated or misused. infocus says sometimes this happens. they for $250 plus $30.00 shipping will fix the fan. i also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. the company keeps saying-it is out of warranty sometimes this happens 1400 hours is just what some lamps get etc. etc. etc.. they will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product. i will get a new projector-i can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. my new projector will not/will never be an infocus product. they have failed to stand behind their product. their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties. don't buy infocus!!!

" you will be surprised how crummy this sounds compared to the panasonics that cost about the same. this is my main problem - the sound quality sucks compared to the competition out there. 1 - the speakers are lightweight and shoddily built. they sound muddy and the deep bass from them is nothing to write home about. they are fairly light weight - meaning very small magnets in them. these are 3 way speakers - for really good sound on the cheap - speakers need to be 2 way! 2 - the sound input consists of a headphone type jack in front. not even standard phono inputs at the back. 3 - its advertised as 320 watts - which is meaningless - since the speakers suck. what good is a high power amp with crappy speakers. and in case you know some audio - 320 watts is only twice as loud as 32 watts (log relationship). for some reason this is not even half as loud as my 100 w receiver! 4 - no user adjustable equalizer only presets possible 5 - cannot connect a different pair of speakers to upgrade because of the biamping type of connections. 6 - the receiver sucks - even my sandisk flash player seems to have a better receiver. i concur with the other reviewer - death to sony! shame on them for taking consumers for a ride. this company nowadays makes it stuff for ultra cheap and prices it competively with the others - meaning - fat profit margins.

" i have owned five of these ups units over the past four years. i purchased three for my mac and pc at home. then i had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. currently only one still works! i have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years. these units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. my g5 mac was so power hungry that i had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch lcd. i can't comment on other ups brands such as belkin but i have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. there seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished apc products but this may be a reflection of apc's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. my experience over the past four years has been mixed. these are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. if you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. i chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. many users do not have that flexibility so a ups is essential insurance. the units i puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. i can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until i bought new batteries. prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. battery life depends on many factors so i don't begrudge apc for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. i bought apc branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. i'm frustated with my apc products but it may be a problem with this model. just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an ups ",negative

" good thing first efficient on batteryconvenient and compact..doubles up as flash drive and no cables except headphone to carry around to charge. thats it. as most of the other reviewers have said this product is absolutely useless because of low iq software people working in sony. utterly non user friendly. i develop software for a living and i am not afraid to use new software...even though i was able to use the software the main drawbacks are the over smartness of software where it tries to control the music piracy.. i had 1gb of atrac songs on this player from my computer. then one day my computer hdd crashed. i was kind of thankful that i had saved atleast 1 gb of music on this bean walkman. atleast all the hours i spent in transfering did not go waste. as soon as i fixed the new hdd and tried to transfer the songs back to my computer..the useless sony softwre will not take the music files back...i tried every trick and even the sony customer support could not help me( a very indifferent group of people). it is a rotten piece of software and that makes this efficient device a waste of money. of course transfering the files to this player is an entirely diff story and i dont want to go abt that.. it is absolutely infuriating ",negative

" the good: when i first heard about this board i was incredibly excited. i have been playing bf2 (battlefield 2) for almost a year now and still continually find myself stumbling over the keys. so it was a godsend to be able to purchase something like this directly intended to help me be better at my game. the interchangable keysets for different games and applications is quite intriguing -- the first that i have seen. but the price for each is kind of high but well worth it. the bad: the board is constructed well but don't expect this to replace your home keyboard. the windows keyset that comes standard with this board has all the keys as any run-of-the-mill keyboard but it is awkward to type with (i might be biased since i have a msoft ergonomic split keyboard). in-game typing is difficult at best (with the gaming keysets). with most of the gaming keysets the keys on the left 1/2 of the keyboard are laid out like your home keyboard but on the right 1/2 side they are all vertical (not staggered.. like uj and m keys are 90 degrees vertically on top of each other). the keys feel a little cheap .. when you push them down they don't bounce back as much. the ugly: about 2 weeks after i purchases this board (and the bf2 keyset) 9 keys went completely dead. i tried to reinstall the software reboot and even resinstalled a fresh copy of windows xp to no avail. i contacted support and it has taken us 3 weeks to finally reach the decision that i have a faulty base unit. duh! they are reviewing my warranty but most likely it will not be covered because it has been longer than 30 day. maybe this post is premature but i don't think i am getting a new base unit. conclusion: the expression great idea bad execution holds true here. my opinion: don't buy this board. ideazon has too many issues not enough support staff and a website that doesn't do anything but look good ",negative

" upon the joyful news that we were having a girl my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer. the digital camera still works great--the printer is another matter. while this one prints beautiful pictures the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes. as we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink. replacing every cartridge at once will run you about $75 at a time give or take a few. the gray ink is used up the quickest and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally. the main problem i have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink but for only about the first 50-70 pictures. after that. the pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register--very frustrating when you're printing out any pictures let alone ones of your child. yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion. every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to. in the long run i will not be buying a photo printer for home use but will rather take them to a store for processing. quality-wise it gets you in the beginning but doesn't hold out for the long run. we have fiddled with it for two years. enough's enough ",negative

" this product looks and feels very flimsy. do not be fooled by the flashy metallic-looking picture. the plastic shell of this device is the quality of mcdonald's toys. one would think that for $300 the company would at least commission a manufacturer that did not leave plastic whiskers hanging off the rims due to bad cutting. the buttons are hard to press. in order to turn the device on you have to press very firmly which is a risky thing to do considering the cracking delicacy of the shell. the cable port for the docupen is also extremely flimsy and you have to hold the cable firmly in place in order for the downloads to take place; otherwise the connection will be lost. i am a pre-medical student and i very stupidly invested a lot of money in this product believing that i could (for 8 seconds a page and 100 pages per disk) scan my science textbooks in the library including the colored diagrams and in that way i thought i would make back my investment since textbooks go for at least $100 each. however i now see that this belief was naive to say the least. the docupen is extremely difficult to use. the words come out distorted like a jammed fax machine and although the free paper port software which comes complimentary with the docupen is rather useful for annotating pdf's the docupen does not produce texts that are legible enough to annotate. furthermore downloading is very slow (at least 15 seconds per page on my fast computer) and since you can't see how your scans have turned out until you load them into the computer you will have to re-scan about 80% of pages due to stretches smudges blurriness suspicious blank spots and general illegibility. i wish i had read some of the other negative amazon reviews before buying this product. i would have saved myself a lot of money and time. if you are a user who is only looking to scan pictures or a few flat documents then this product may work okay for you although a digital camera will probably deliver better results. if you have been harboring grandiose visions of going all-out paperless with this product you will find yourself extremely disappointed. until planon decides that this product is worthy enough to invest in a semi-decent shell manufacturuer it will not a good buy. the idea is wonderful and has a lot of potential especially when coupled with a tablet pc. however the execution of the idea needs improvement. i hope to see a far better version of this product in the next few years at a price that is comparable to quality.

" this product is a sad joke. it's expensive of course. the paper is just heavyweight paper that's perforated so you can bend it and break out the inserts themselves... which takes some effort (not sure if it'd be quicker just getting heavyweight paper and using a paper cutting board). but whatever. however the software is crap. that's the appropriate term. reading this i can save you an hour of your precious time. no you can't make the template show right-side up. that's right... to use the software you have to tilt your head sideways. i'm not kidding! i guess you could also turn your monitor on it's side. you can rotate the text so it shows the way it should. but when you edit it it'll be sideways again. so you'll have to turn your head (or monitor) back and forth sideways. what kind of company would sell such a product? and oh yeah... if you're looking for templates for the dvd inserts? ... nada. they're not there!

" there are many aspects of the t5 people want to count as negatives. for me i consider them annoyances but not killers. i would like to have wifi with my pda but i am not dead with out it. more memory is always good but the t5 isn't on the hurting side. it's not a good mp3 player with the memory it has. and even if you have a 2g card with mp3's it's not like this is what you would buy for mp3s. but as far as contact information on the go applications etc.. i would consider this as good as any other. the problem as i have just found out is these are known to die. i haven't heard of this issue till it happened to me but it seems the t5 will at some point die. it will lock up and even after all the resets listed from palm it will not come back to even a factory state. you will have a palm powered logo screen with a small black line flashing on the top. there are a couple of fixes. if you are under warranty you can send it back to palm for them to make it better. or you can remove the battery and solder it back. this is a serious design issue that palm is more than happy to charge you for. until i ran into this i would have rated this a 4/5. until this happened the device did what i expected it to do. i read the box before buying it and knew it had some lack of cool factor with the no wifi. but it has one of the fastest processors (available at that time) in a pda. which was a different type of cool. the bluetooth works well enough i haven't had any issues with it. you can surf the net with bluetooth so wifi isn't really that big of a deal. but if you can't trust your device is going to be working the next day it really doesn't matter what cool feature it has. this has been a very expensive let down. i don't want to buy another palm after this experience but i am not sure what to switch to...

" i bought this headset from retailer (offline) and returned it the next day. first off i have to make it clear that i had no problems with sound. even though the speakers could have been just a tiny bit bigger (they use 40mm drivers) the sound quality of the headset was just fine. however when it comes to wearing these headphones the only words that come to mind are uncomfortable as sin. the awkward squarish shape of the cups made it hard to get any kind of decent seal around the ears (and a bad seal on closed-back headphones ultimately leads to poor sound isolation). also i have no idea what material they used for the cup pads but it is nowhere near soft enough... in fact i litterally couldn't wear these things for more than five minutes without my ears turning red (flush) from discomfort. mind you i also own a cheap pair of koss headphones i can keep on for hours at a time so my ears are definitely no stranger to being cupped in speakers either... but these things they just plain hurt to wear after a very short period of time which isn't good at all. discomfort and being unable to obtain a good seal around the ears were ultimately the main reasons for the return. if your ears are tough you should have no problem with this headset. the sound quality is decent and it should work just fine for you. however if you're looking for comfort and good sound isolation you'll want to look elsewhere..

" i read the other reviews some glowing others well.. not so glowing. the price was right ($149 - 50 rebate) so i thought i would take a chance. i read the other reviews so i have no one else to blame but myself. first off i am only interested in playing videos from my computer so i have no idea how well the image viewing or mp3 playing works. i also notice other people reviewing this product had all kinds of problems with wireless connections. my house is fully wired with cat5 therefore i am using this product wired not wireless. i was able to get the device connected to my network and reading files from the media server within 10 minutes of opening the carton... so far so good. the first thing i did was check for updates. an update was found and updated successfully. i then had the dsm-320 look for media servers. it found the tversity server right away and i was able to see the contents listed. this unfortunately is the end of the good news. it's all went downhill from here. 1. neither server tversity or the dlink were smart enough to view a folder of vob files as a movie. they listed them as vob_1 vob2 etc. so for example i clicked on my casablanca folder i would then need to click on vob_1 to start the movie. when vob_1 ended after about 20 minutes it did not go to vob_2. i needed to use the remote and manually select the next item to play. arrrgghh!! p.o.s. thing. 2. as another review stated the ff simply does not work properly. oh sure if you press ff the movie will fast forward. but there is no way to stop it. if you press play while the movie is ff'wding the movie starts to play from the beginning of the current vob. more arrrrgghh! this alone is enough of a nuisance to return the device. which i will be doing first thing in the morning. my final advice to any prospective buyers: s t a y a w a y !!!! my final advic to d-link great idea but your product absolutely sucks. oh one more thing someone mentioned that their tech support was very freindly. yes the two ladies i spoke to were both very friendly their english was terrible. (guess which county you call for tech support... oh come on just one guess) it also sounded like each of the tech support personnel are sitting shoulder to shoulder to one another. i could hear at least 2 other tech support people communicating with their clients. which made it very difficult for the lady helping me. she needed to ask me to repeat myself over and over. sheesh i must have read my phone number to her at least 4 times before she got it right. one last interesting tidbit on the packaging they mention nero recode ce. so i went to the nero site to check it out. nero has a list of supported media players listed. and you know what d-link is not one of them. i will return this d-link junk and purchase one the nero certified product instead. i bow my head in shame as i had read the reviews but i bought the product anyway.

" i had a pronto neo for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after i dropped it 1.5 feet onto a hardwood floor. the unit has a very cheap feel especially for the price. i wasn't at all surprised when it stopped working. the pc software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap. the touchscreen is very tedious to customize (i write software for a living and i still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen). i can't imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your pc to the remote. the whole point of the pronto neo is that you can customize the touch screen. unless you are very comfortable with computer applications do not buy this unit. aside from the touchscreen's fagility is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small given the size of the remote. did i mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months? in short this product is crap. i might consider buying another one if it sold for $30 or less ",negative
" whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. there is no point in havng one vpn client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client. it would be similar to say allowing people to just access one web site on the internet. in my case i already had two vpn clients related to work when i installed a netgear router with vpn capabilities on my home network. the vpn software from netgear stops my other vpn clients working. added to my woes i can't tell you how often i saw 'the blue screen of death' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts. i am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution ",negative

" i was given the ique m3 for christmas of 2005. a few months into the new year i dropped it onto pavement and it broke. for $99 garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit which i consider a fair price. unfortunately the refurb unit couldn't play directions at full volume so i returned it for another refurb. this unit fell off the windshield still in it's cradle and it started making that frying sound of short circuits. i called garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit they'd look at it under warranty. i had told the guy what happened so i was pleasantly surprised; they did in fact replace it. under all circumstances the report you get back says the returned unit was within specifications (or words to that effect) even though clearly not. i have no idea why. units will be returned with new software keys to enter and the software will begin urging you to register even though you already have. for some the mapping software on the m3 will appear crippled. it is a basic drive from here to there unit. it does not allow you to load way-points points of interest and the like. each of the units had quirks. on the first one every time i inserted the sd card with maps windows player (or whatever it's called) would start up and ask me if i wanted to search the card for tunes. the second one had inaudible volume. the fourth one has a problem common to the first one: the brightness resets itself randomly to zero. yep zero. the first one left the powered brightness full on so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on but this one resets them both to zero. so you may think the unit is not turning on but it's on. you just can't see anything on the screen. if you're outside you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting but if it's dark you need a flashlight. the current one will do a hard reset if i start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when i put it in the cradle. this means i have to do the full new user routine. touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen. press and hold to learn again how to copy. press and hold to learn again how to paste. reset the time from olathe kansas to where i live. all contacts notes calendars and other information is lost. all preferences are gone. after i've gone through the restart routine the unit will then find the satellites and get me where i'm going but i can't load destinations from contacts as they're gone so i have to type them all in by hand. if the battery runs out of juice the unit is dead. it forgets everything and i have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen. press and hold to learn again how to copy. press and hold to learn again how to paste. reset the time from olathe kansas to where i live. all contacts notes calendars and other information is lost. all preferences are gone. i complained about this to support at garmin and i was assured this is a microsoft feature and that garmin can do nothing about it. they recommended that i buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an sd card where it will not be lost. so now i carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data. i did learn though that if the battery runs down the backup program is lost so you can't retrieve your data from the backup sd card unless you have told the program to save as self-extracting archives. i learned it the hard way of course. to restore i pop out the detailed maps sd card insert the backup card navigate to the file explorer navigate to the sd card open the contents of the sd card select the latest back up click through the restore procedure click to ok that it has finished (just a minute or two with my small amount of data) click to restart wait a long time for it to restart tap to get past the owner data screen enter the password then pop the restore card out reinstall the map card wait while it reads it then i'm good to go. i can't do it while i'm driving of course so if the unit resets on its own i just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where home is which means i have to type it or other locations into the where to dialogue. the unit defaults to 3d directions instead of north is always up which is confusing for me as i can't look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where i am vis-a-vis the map. i'm sure this is my shortcoming and i then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up which i can't do while driving. it also defaults to different displays for day and night. the night display uses a dark background and i have found that the menus for the windows programs use a transparent background with black text. so i can't read the menu selections against the dark display. and the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if i lose power or the unit resets when i start the car or sometimes when i put it in the cradle. on the contacts database the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe kansas. it also formats all numbers as us numbers. i have a few overseas numbers and they are crammed into the (xxx) xxx-xxxx format even though they are longer and don't start with an area code. in the calendar if i have meetings scheduled outside my time zone i enter them at the time they're scheduled. then when i get there i have the option of choosing the visited time zone and all the times are screwed up as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone. so i never use the visited time zone feature and the unit assumes i'm still in my home zone wherever i may travel. i have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address but for which i have the lat/long coordinates. i camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads - i quickly lose where i am and have to zoom out which loses the road. on the whole the directions part of the m3 is excellent. it gives good directions has reasonably up to date maps and lets you find stores restaurants gas stations hotels and the like in your area and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations. on the whole using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper. after a year of use i can't put up with it anymore. i'll take garmin's word that this is all a shortcoming of windows mobile and not garmin's fault but i can't put up with it anymore. i'll switch to magellan or tomtom or some other unit that isn't windows-based and that doesn't completely lose its mind when the battery runs down doesn't randomly do a hard reset doesn't randomly set the brightness to zero and doesn't assume all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe kansas. maybe another manufacturer will let me import pois and way-points from other people's files ",negative

" just received radio yesterday and am returning radio today! pluses.... adequate lcd display and good illumination while on ac adapter. good thumbwheel tuning in 1 khz increments. adequate speaker fidelity for small radio. however the volume slew buttons have set numbered volume levels and between settings of 5-6 there is a big noticeable increase in volume(not good) and while tuning shortwave bands every approx 100khz increment there appears to be a null area where signal meter reads a signal received but quiet speaker. also on fm if hands are near the radio the signal breaks up(for weaker signals not strong ones) and compared to my grundig 400-pe which i feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome the eton e-5 seems worse still!!! i am returning this today and obtaining the sony 7600gr instead. eton e-5 not bad but certainly not worth 3 stars or above especially if comparing it to another similar size radio and then comparing it to my sony 2010.

" i purchased the 8gb creative zen v plus player during the first week in february. i am returning it and this is why: the package arrived from amazon. i loaded up the software on my computer then hooked up the player through the usb cord. i let it charge for 6 hours like the instructions state. then i proceeded to load some of my music onto the player. so after the music was loaded i disconnected the player from the usb cable and started to listen to the music. the sound quality was good the player is easy to navigate in the menus etc... the problem was about half the music i uploaded was not on the player. i could see the folder and menu option for the artist or genre but the actual file was not there. so i plugged the player back into the usb cord and pulled up the file location on the player through the computer. the file was there and i could play it just fine through windows media player. i tried to access it again through the player and it was not there. then i accessed through the computer just fine. all my songs all 4500 of them are in mp3 format from 56kps for my audio books to 192kps for the songs i ripped from cd's. the player just wouldn't read about half my songs. there was really no rhyme or reason on whish songs it would recognize. i would load an entire album of 15 songs and i could only play 6 or 7 tracks. this happened with my entire music collection. so i thought maybe the firmware was out of date so i uploaded all the updates from creative which did include a firmware update. it did not solve the problem. i then uploaded some of the same songs that would not play on the zen v plus onto my 3 year old rio and original ipod shuffle and they played just fine. i was frustrated at this point so i called the creative customer service. it is strange because they do not post the number for there company anywhere on there website and now i understand why. they have the worst customer service/tech department of any computer/electronic company i have ever spoke with. after three calls never speaking to someone who i could fully understand as english was definitely not a first language more like a 3rd or 4th language i arrived nowhere. they kept telling me they were emailing document to me on how to resolve the problem. no email ever came checked the junk folder and every other possible place. so i tried a fourth call. this guy basically called me stupid from what i could understand saying i can't believe you americans and then mumbled something in another language. i asked for a supervisor. he told me that he would escalate my call and someone would call me in 2-3 days. then he hung up. i was really amazed that a company would treat its customers in this nature. they really have to respect for there customers and do not want to help them in any way. so i am returning the creative zen v plus player and i also don't plan on buying anything from creative again. by the way after all this the problem never was fixed. also when doing research on this product i came across a couple articles and reviews that stated this player would play divx files. this is not true. this player will not play any files without being converted first. i took an avi video that was 100mb and it converted it into a 1.2gb file. the format they use is absolutely a waste of space. if you want to upload an entire movie on mpeg or avi format it will end up taking the entire 8gb of space if not more. i converted the movie cars for my son on a short road trip thinking i could have my music plus his movie. i was wrong the movie took up 7.1gb after being converted. i would not recommend this product to anyone. as much as i don't like the ipod i would recommend it over the zen v plus because: 1. it plays all my music 2. they have a customer service/tech support that helps you and cares about its customers. i hope this helps anyone looking at this player. jeff ",negative

" we ordered this case/auto mount for our philips pet710 7 widescreen portable dvd player because it was the one recommended by amazon. i needed the auto mount for long car rides with my toddler. i eventually got this thing to work (failure was not an option if you get my drift) but it has a number of drawbacks. -in order to mount it you have to remove the top half(huh?). having two parts makes it harder to install and easier to lose. i accidentally left the top part on the top of the car when i drove away. -it's too small. the philips portable dvd player is too long for the case and the headphones and car/ac converters also pull the player out of the case. plus (and this is really amazing) it does not have enough space to hold the most basic accessories that came with the dvd player. i have to carry the headphones and sleaved dvds seperately! i chose my last dvd player b/c it came with an auto mount case and even though i like the philips dvd player i'd do that again if i had it to do over. having the right case/mount for your dvd player is that key ",negative

" the software to this mp3 player made it too much work. anything that freezes up my computer has to go. here's my experience. i purchased this player on february 23rd and returned it to the store on march 8th. i was somewhat apprehensive from the beginning about the software but decided to give it a try. i installed the software with no problem but found the media player to be cumbersome compared to other media players. i just didn't like the look of it or how it categorized the music files. i did download some music and other audio files and the player worked just fine. it had a very nice sound easy to use and wonderful to carry around. i listened to it quite a bit and the battery stayed almost at a full charge. fast foward week 2 i wanted to delete some files and add some new ones. i opened up the media player and did the exact same thing as i did at first. first the program began running really slow and then froze. i ctr/alt delete and started over. it worked for a second and then froze again. i rebooted and it did the same thing. i came back to it the next day and it did it again. i uninstalled it (so i thought) and it continued to freeze. it doesn't completely uninstall off of your computer. i know this because i didn't have to re-authorize my computer to use it again. i had to manually go in and find it and remove it from my computer. there are lots of hidden files. in conclusion had it not been for my experience with the software i would have kept the player.

" ok so this is probably not the best protection for your ipod but what do you want for 6 bucks? i'm cheap. if you're not buy something more expensive perhaps... pros: - it does protect the screen and click wheel nicely. - the flip-up top magnetically shuts and holds securely which i guess helps if you happen to drop it. cons: - the belt clip is ridiculous. it's not a stationary clip. instead it spins around which makes the likelihood of it falling off your hip greater. this product is not for the joggers. - the leather strap that comes with it is too short which makes it difficult to operate the ipod when it's around your neck. - it seems that the magnets leave marks on the areas not mentioned under pros above. but as long as you never take your ipod out of the case no worries. - this is made for the 30 gb ipod video but it's actually a little big for it. it leaves room for the ipod to slide up and down in the case. it makes accessing the hold switch difficult sometimes when the flip-up top is down. it's easier to just open the top. if you don't care about the cons and you are cheap like me go ahead and buy it ",negative

" the epson r2400 is a purely photo printer. be sure to understand this before you buy. so if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it . . . think again. the k3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted. it took three calls to epson and replacing the icc profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the k3 ink compatibility with the plain paper. all the magazines raved about the black and white printing quality. not. at least not on premium quality photo paper. perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers. i saw very little improvement over my epson r320. now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer. the biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as staples. the in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore. this is hint #1. hint #2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for monday you are sol. the only option you have is to order the ink online. trust amazon as they can find and deliver. however if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges. cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $12-$15 each with eight of them your burning $100-$125 a set. bulk ink tanks are coming out but i doubt the k3 inks will be imitated. if you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you. however at $850 i fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper. i haven't been happy with this printer and i plan to replace it soon. amazon's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here.

" this home theater package despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality is ultimately very disappointing. i'm new to hdtv and hdmi so i didn't know as much as i needed in order to make a fully informed decision. i have a sony bravia xbr3 oppo upconverting dvd player scientific atlanta hd box and nintendo wii game console. this unit only offers pass-through video so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the tv for each type of input (hdmi component etc.). for the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection you'll pay in extra cabling costs. the hdmi on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your dvd or cable to the receiver and then from the receiver to your tv. again major inconvenience and lots of additional connections. the manual for this unit is beyond terrible. i'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one. for example there was a hum when watching tv that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some aren't. nothing in the manual about this. there are probably just enough hdmi and component connections for the basic user like myself. plus side is that there is no dvd player with this so i can use my own. given a chance to do this again i would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output ",negative

" in short why a 1 star rating you wonder? took forever to set up properly; long wait time and poor help from tech support; automatic set-up i doubt will ever work for anyone. though it does work once finally set up. __________________________________________________________ so i decided to go wireless at home with a new laptop new wireless router and a wireless print server (ps) so i can put the printer in the garage and free up space in the house. i did a lot of research and decided to get a belkin router (f5d7231-4) and this ps from the same manufacturer so hopefully they would set-up easily together. this is definitely not the case! first be warned this product is not wpa compatible! thus even though the router is wpa able you cannot use wpa with the ps and thus have to use wep for the network once this product is used. hopefully in the future this product will support wpa but it would only hopefully do so thru a firmware upgrade. do not think this ps is wpa compatible. next be warned the box says 3 minute easy install - well it took me about 12 hours total to get the ps working now wirelessly. i am not a computer techie but i am smart a great problem solver and savvy enough to teach myself how to create a whole html website with hundreds of pages. i tried to set-up the ps on a static ip address as recommended by my techie friends but this just did not happen. thus next time i restart the router it may assign the ps a different ip address and then i'll have to find it thru the router interface and reconfigure the printer set-up for that new address-so i plan to spend more time in the future revisiting this issue. the crux of how i got it to work is by using the router interface and entering the mac addresses of the ps and computers in the network. this is the golden key i searched for for hours trying all permutations of all the other settings in the router's and ps's web interfaces. only this way was i able to unhook the land-line from the ps to the router and get it to interface and thus work wirelessly. belkin tech support had medium wait time friendly techs (not always speaking english without thick accents though) and they were unable to solve my golden key for me. they even promised a chief tech would call me back but that never happened. so yes the product works fine but just be warned from someone perhaps like yourself that i had to learn way more about this whole network/configuration issue than i ever wanted or expected to and i had to manually configure the whole set-up to get this product to work.

" i have had this kensington fm transmitter for about 2 months and in my hands it has very acceptable sound and not alot of static. unfortunately it has one fatal design flaw that makes listening to classical jazz and any other type of music with any quiet passages very frustrating. during the quiet parts the unit will shut itself off causing my car audio to emit a ear piercing screech when it loses the signal. i haven't measured it but it seems like as little a 10-15 seconds of quiet causes this behavior. this makes this unit useless for classical music and quite a bit of jazz and other similar styles. if you listen to quiet music avoid at all costs. if you don't it is the best transmitter i have tried. sirandar ",negative

" the radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- i cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; i can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. the dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio even in the case without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station. in minneapolis-st. paul wcco am radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. but that station has howitzer power. forget about tuning in virtually any other am station in the city. granted i didn't buy this to listen to fm or shortwave. it was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. with the minnesota twins having moved from wcco that won't happen as this radio is incapable of pulling in the twins' new am radio home or any othe am signal in the area. that's really difficult to imagine being other radios i own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area. if this is an example of grundig's work i'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.

" i got this case for my ws-320m which i've been wearing around my neck like a mp3 player. the material of the case seems to be genuine leather (or really good vinyl) and brushed felt. it looks good = professional looking. i've enclosed what i hope are representative pictures of this case. all the buttons of the recorder are accessible. even when the flap is closed the microphone/headphone jacks are available as are the rec/stop/play buttons. if the 2 tiny holes on top of the recorder are apertures for the built-in microphone you should indeed be able to record with the flap of the case closed as well. there is a little cushion portion embedded as a part of the case that pushes gently against the hold button on the side of the recorder. not only does this prevent the recorder from jostling around but was probably designed to prevent accidental release of the hold button. however since the hold button is meant to slide down (away from the microphone) for it to be released if the recorder was accidently pulled out of the case the resulting friction would actually unlock the hold button. the belt loop is an adjustable velcro. i would have preferred a sewn-on belt loop (so the case cannot come off the belt accidently) or a nice stiff clip (for easy access) or even a riveted snap button but this seems to be a poor compromise between the options. most of this opinion of mine is probably based on my bias against in velcro in general - they seem to be just weak enough to cause problems at the most inopportune times. the case is closed shut with another velcro strap all in all it seems to be designed to merely protect the surface of the recorder during transport. or being able to put it on your belt after everything else (line-in mic headphone recording/playing) is set up. the relative inaccessibility of the buttons when the recorder is inside the case (mainly due to very small buttons) as well as the case not being very conducive to acting as a stand would lead me to suggest that it is not very functional to record with the recorder inside the case. the case seems to be better for carrying around in your pocket and whipping it out for the bystanders to admire the case prior to revealing the recorder. my bias lies in that i like to use it as an mp3 player and i wear it around my neck by commandeering a strap/loop from a flash drive. placing the recorder on your belt will create more opportunities for the earphone/mic to fall out from the waving of arms and such. i think a better choice would have been one of the cheaper generic cell phone cases that clip on to your belt. on one positive note i believe this is the first time that i was the first reviewer for anything from amazon. woo hoo ",negative

" this printer is a piece of junk. the print mechanism is constructed of flimsy plastic so that unless care is taken in inserting the print cartridges the mechanism is likrly to be damaged. like other hp printers operating under xp it is almost impossible to cancel a pring job in case of a problem ( e.g. paper jam paper out). cancelling a print job results in a deleting document message which remains until printer is disconnected (you can turn it off under these circumstances) and computer is rebooted. often xp hangs up and the computer must be poered off withexiting windows properly which results in a long diskcheck on repowering. i have long had this problem with an older hp model but had hoped they had corrected this problem in their software by now but alas.... the crown of it all is the life of the ink cartridge. the tricolor cartridge costing about $18 at wal-mart lasts for about 12 8 x 10 photos before the ink low warning comes up. in sumarry: don't buy this printer whatever the price. it would probably be wise to avoid hp inexpensive printers altogether.

" looking at the photo of this item i noticed the plug at the end of this car lighter charger is not the screw on contraption needed for my explorist 400 so i was hesitant to purchase it until i did further research and found out why the plug is different. you still need the usb cable that came with the explorist and have to bring it in the car too! the big ac plug detaches from the usb cable and aha! now you have a jack that this car charger can plug into! then you screw that cable onto your gps unit as when you charge it via ac. in other words... this charger does not plug into your gps it plugs into your gps charger cable which attaches to your gps. but i don't want to take that cable in the car with me because if it gets damaged or lost then i can never charge the unit at all not even at home with ac. so i was forced to find and purchase another usb cable assembly seperately to keep in the car with this car lighter charger. magellan should have just put the screw on connector at the end of this car charger instead of the way they did it. the car lighter charger has a nice coiled cord but what good is it? you still have to have the long usb cable attached to it anyway! but hopefully this will help everyone that like me was puzzled by the photo of the item and the connector that isn't going to fit anywhere in the explorist 400 ",negative

" i have no axe to grind with bose. i originally bought this speaker for a custom cabinet with almost no room for a center channel set up. this speaker has an incredibly small footprint. if space is limited this is not a bad option. however being honest this is not a great center channel speaker. choosing speakers is like the addage certain horses for certain courses. your budget your room your components - all play a part. i have two home theater setups. one is a daily gathering area with basic in wall treatments from polk audio. the other is a dedicated theater utilizing definitive technologies with b&k reference 7.1 processing. clearly the bose vcs-10 can not hold its own with my larger setup. however i have run it with my polk audio's and it was workable. the timbre match was slightly off and the vocals were not as sharp as they are with my polk csi3 but it was not awful. my bottom line - you can certainly buy a better center channel speaker. can you buy a better one in this price range. i think so - if you are only focused on the quality of this one speaker and not the blended sound of your system. you should always buy the best components within your budget - but remember you are building a system - it's not just about one speaker. if this speaker fits your space and (more importantly) matches your other speakers then it may be the right speaker for you ",negative
" i purchased this speaker about four years ago to complement my bose main speakers for my surround sound set up. at that time i felt the sound quality was pretty good but over the years as i listened to other center channels that other people had in their home theater set ups i came to realize that the bose center speaker sound quality was not up to par. so last year i purchased a polk center speaker and the improvement in sound quality is absolutely insane. the polk speaker which costs the same as the bose ($199) was far and away the better product. the sound is cleaner crisper sharper...it made watching movies much more enjoyable. i couldn't believe what i had been missing out on all these years. the only reason i purchased the bose was to match my speakers but that was a mistake because the sound i have now with polk center and bose main is excellent. depending on who you ask the center speaker is the most important speaker in a home entertainment audio system. if that's true then i wouldn't recommend bose because all you're doing is buying the name and not the sound quality and to me that's a waste of money. i know because i made that mistake.

" i bought this speaker about one year ago from best buy very disappointed. the sound quality is terrible i have two presence channel $15 klh speakers that sound better than this. no high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic hence why bose is not high end. after a year of misery on my ears i've replaced this with a paradigm center speaker that only cost $20 more and the difference is not even comparable. do not buy this or any bose product at all. save your money and buy paradigm b&w or similar most of the time they cost a little bit more but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers and you will get your money's worth ",negative

" i have owned the dmr-es40v for over 6 months. it is a combo dvd/vcr unit. i have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit. the manual: it is imperative to have the manual. this machine is somewhat complicated and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary. if everything is working correctly you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it. it is overly time-consuming though since the items don't seem to logically flow. if you dig long and hard enough though they are in there somewhere. the set-up: being somewhat experienced at setting-up a home theater this was generally easy. the text and pictures were sufficient. searching through the function menu i learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons. this is needlessly confusing. of course the auto clock set function isn't very accurate ( i haven't seen an accurate one yet). dvd playback: the general playback is pretty straight-forward. i really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my jvc progressive player (which is 3 years older). finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult. a zoom feature is missing. many convenience features are not present. dvd recording: recording onto a dvd-ram disc is a dream compared to old fashioned vcr tapes. i really enjoy using them. a quirk--you must have the unit in stand-by to record from the scheduler. this mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another(on the same disc) you must wait until the unit begins recording then select the show to watch from the navigator. the uhf tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel 19. other weak channels record but not 19. this problem started about 6 months after initial set-up. there is an annoying bug with daylight savings time and the newer extended time period. the panasonic web site suggests going into the set-up menu and unchecking the dst box; thus removing the feature. if this did anything it would allow you to set the clock manually. being without the automatic dst adjustment would not be annoying but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at 7pm est. this ruins any tv scheduling you had set. this malady persisted until the date of the former dst spring-ahead arrived. several weeks of scheduling hell! i requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised. no message no number to call--just a promise to call again when i was home. the vcr use: this feature is really buggy. you are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote; but this only worked for a month or two. when a tv show is scheduled for recording the unit won't tape it if you merely insert a cassette. it doesn't recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move--either playing a little or fast forwarding/reversing. this is really annoying. last impression: the last movie (last king of scotland) i watched took over the machine. the remote control would not function the disc would not stop and the disc could not be ejected. it was necessary to unplug the unit restart it eject the disc and totally reset all menu items--which were randomly reset to various settings. worse some settings are no longer selectable. one other movie would not even play in the machine--forcing me to use the trusty jvc unit. i must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what i read at this forum and other ones. these units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption. i recommend looking elsewhere.

" the write up sounds good with many options and features but after closer examination i had to take it back. first thing it appears that the front dv plug was an after-thought for panasonic it's a rinky-dink plastic flap on the opposite side of where the main av/s plugs are located. this is often done at the last moment of production where they add a newer feature to an older designed unit retro fitting it in wherever. the tiny button within a button toggle switch for fastforward reverse etc looks like it's glued on it won't last long with normal use and it's hard to use and in a bad place on the upper corner of the unit. the menu interface is difficult to navigate. the remote control is horrible a real bad design for those who want to navigate quickly without looking closely at the buttons to figure out what button to push for each of the basic and most used features. you might want to pass on this one remember the saying if it sounds too good to be true it probabily is ",negative

" i've owned two of these now. the screen's great and i love the wireless headphones -- terrific for very small children. our 2-year-old drove to new mexico and back (well we drove and he watched videos) with this thing. unfortunately both units broke after less than a year of use. the first one just stopped working (with a dvd permanently trapped inside). the second one just developed an intermittent white-out and screen noise that's happening once a minute now. so i am reluctantly abandoning this nice but very poorly made product and trying a different one. all of these little players seem to have reliability problems so my main advice to everybody is buy the extended warranty and make sure the warranty you buy will work swiftly and easily with no hassles -- you will be cashing it in ",negative
" my wife dropped the original remote and it quite working. it turns out there are pcb's inside and one surface mount connector to the other board came loose so i resoldered it and it worked for a little while probably until the next time she dropped it. i bought the updated remote and one drop was all it took to disable the receive part of it also. could not find the problem this time. it still transmitted but eventually quit transmitting after the alarm was on. i unlocked the truck manually and every time someone opened or closed a door the alarm would go off and i could not start the truck. i messed with it (while in the parking lot of an amusment park) for a long time and evetually got it to stop probably by entering valet mode i'm not sure. don't waste your money on another $100 remote. i am shopping for a remote that is transmit only without the lcd. should be more reliable. my suggestion is to buy a system that comes with 2 remotes: one lcd and one simple. better yet buy a system that does not have the feedback or 2 way and save a lot of money and headache. you won't use it anyway ",negative

" the only good thing about this product is its price (i saw it being sold at $160 on some other site). there are several shortcomings though: - the greatest drawback is the complexity of the menu. there is no 'home location'. also there are only two navigation options available - shortest time & shortest distance. so if you are caught in a traffic jam for example there is no 'detour' function. also you cannot see the next few turns when you are navigating. hence you cannot plan if you immediately need to turn right after a left or vice versa. - the maps are probably very old. i used this device in nj va & mn. in every state i faced problems multiple times when the unit did not know that the road bifurcated ahead & it would not tell me to keep on left/right or it would ask me take turns when there were none. - the unit was very slow in calculating routes (i dont know how the sirf star iii chip helps). also it would freeze often & i would need to reset it at critical junctions. - the viamichellin website is only dedicated to europe. when i went to register my product i had to register it in viamichellin uk since there was no option for us! i dont think they have any support for the us models. - the pois are very less compared to other competitors within the same price range. i returned this product after trying to make it work for 2 months. it was great on part of amazon to accept it even after expiration of return policy (although they deducted 20% restocking fee).

" i really tried to like the via michelin bought it with every intention of loving it in march 2007. but i feel compelled to tell most of you to keep shopping. i bought it due to the excellent price small thin size(compared to garmin). i thought how bad can it be? i ordered it and had it shipped to my door then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it. this is because my other gps units were in other cars with other family members already on other trips. i bought this one as a budget gps optimistic that it was new and had the sirf-iii chip. but before long i hated this unit all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me and i will tell you about it below. first please note there are a few positive reviews for this unit....but have you noticed they are mostly all people who have no experience with other gps units? or they didn't spend much time with it before they reviewed it? or they haven't had experience with gps in 4 years..which is like a century in terms of how fast this technology is changing? for positive reviewers if this is their first newer gps and if they are comparing it to a car navigational gps of 4 years ago then yes it is quite a bit better. but compared to the new units like mio 310x or the tom tom one (both of which i own) then the viamichelin has a horrible user interface and is horrible to use on the roads. tomtom and mio often finish what you are typing for you they are intuitive and programmers have polished them. but the viamichelin is very non intuitive absolutely dangerous to try to use on the fly. sure we are not supposed to use them while we drive and with this one it is truly dangerous even when you learn the complicated system. so most of the time you have to pull over and work on it. but it is no fun and even you program it if you go to another screen it loses it and you have to program the history all over. you will soon be frustrated with how many steps this unit takes to do anything and how lost it often gets. i will try to give you the pros: pros: small form factor decent screen sirf 3 chip. navteq maps. four hour battery life. good price for a sirf-3 chip unit. cons: horrible non intuitive software program clunky multi step interface that will make your life horrible if you are in a rush or emergency...or even if you are not in a hurry. horrible speaker..volume so poor and speaker so poor you can't hear it with any road noise present...seriously...turn speaker up all the way while driving..it will crackle and is illegible. i read this in a review but honestly didn't believe it until i owned it. third unlike any gps i've had this one literally tells you to start driving before it can tell you which way to go when you've routed it to the nearest store etc. think about that! it means sometimes you have a 50% chance of making the right choice as to which way to go...then if you guess wrong it tells you to turn around and go the other way! seriously...that one feature should be enough to make you say no as most gps will at least tell you to turn right from where you are parked or turn left but this one will say start driving without any direction....because it can't seem to route until you drive onto a road. it can't do it from a parking lot! it already will have the satellite location...that's not it..it's a software bugaboo i think built into the programming. it makes you start driving because it can't find your location or know which way you are going..until you start and it routes the direction you are traveling. bad software design for sure. when you go to canada you have to have installed (on another sd card) the canadian map....very inconvenient when you cross the border. navteq maps could not find many locations on coastal maine. literally we were driving on coastal roads it said did not exist. i found it very slow recalculating trips when you missed a turn (much slower than my mio 310 which was purchasd last year or tom tom one which was purchased this year) and this recalculation problem in busy city traffic caused us to miss several critical exits. want to find poi's on the run? forget it. too many steps and illogical organization compared to other major brands. it often could not find even local walmarts...one's that have been there for 20 years. i'm serious. i parked in front of walmarts that it could not find...very old walmarts. to be sure garmin tomtom and mio do not list all walmarts but at least they get 4 or 5 out of 7 in my home town. not so via. in several towns in maine and connecticut i parked in front of rows of old stores that had been there for years. punch in local stores on the difficult to use poi list and it can't find any of them. also punch in or look for stores like nearest walmart....mio and tom tom had no problems finding several..or the nearest ones it knew about from your location. but with via it has to be within a certain distance from you..or it will not show up as existing. so....you then have to figure out the next town and search from that location to try to find the store. very very clunky....can't tell you how much trouble that is. it's so simple on the other units you get spoiled with the garmin or tomtoms. this one makes it so hard and still can't find the poi's. no gps finds all stores....there is a limit on poi's of course. but it seems the via programmers spent their time gathering addresses for bank atm's and not restaurants shopping etc. believe me once you've used it on a trip it's organized to make you believe the programmers never actually used a gps themselves before. i can't say enough about how difficult the interface is....and when you go back or forward to another screen it often loses where it is...and you have to start all over again programming where you are going going through multiple difficult steps. when you lose power again you start all over. when i bought it i read some of the negative and positive reviews and thought....how bad can it be? i thought the complaining people are probably not techie and are complaining for no reason. wrong! the experienced gps users are the ones that know just how clunky and bad this software interface is compared to the sleek garmin or tom tom interfaces. example: on one trip my daughter began to throw up and we had to find an emergency medical treatment facility....this clunky interface made it very difficult to locate one. when you are panicked you want to quickly find the nearest hospital. this unit makes you put in the town etc. if you are further than x miles or so...like when you are on the interstate....so you are literally guessing which town to search to find a hospital. which is horrible. i had this happen before and with the mio about 3 clicks and bam you have searched and found the nearest hospital...one more click and you are routed to the nearest hospital. truly i am sad to not recommend the viamichelin. i really recommend you pass like some other reviewers have suggested. and i recommend you to buy the more rapid easy to use mio with the great screen blazing fast sirf 3 and calculating chip and loud-clear-speaker. if you are tech challenged buy the garmin or tomtom's with their awesome and easy to use software interface. but don't buy this bad speakered horrible interfaced poorly designed buggy unit. on paper it looks like a killer unit. but in reality it is an unpolished clunky paper tiger that is horrible to use. finally there is the fun factor. the tomtom one is fun. the mio is fast and fun a pleasure to use! even the newer garmin's are fun with their simplicity (i hated the screen on some of the old garmins.) but the viamichelin x-930 has no fun programmed in....it is not a pleasure to use although it will take you across country. believe me the pleasure of the low price will quickly fade once you start working with the unhearable speaker unpolished unfun clunky interface with poorly organized features and disorganized poi's and menus. the polished quick intuitive menu is where garmin and tomtom shine. the only thing better on the viamichellin is the screen and sirf-chip...some of the older garmin's use an older satellite gps chip than the viamichellin but new tomtom's and via use the same gps satellite chip but faster software routines and cpu chips. but even the use of the sirf-3 chip on the via michelin cannot make up for the poor software and menu design. theoretically this thing should be blazing fast but it is much slower than my tomtom or mio. the only thing better on this unit than the mio is that the via is smaller and thinner. and maybe the navteq maps might be slightly better for some locals. but other than that the mio wins hands down by far a faster better and easier to use gps in my opinion. if you are looking for software ease go garmin first then tom-tom then mio and via last. if you are looking for value in a great unit then go with the mio 310x it's a killer unit and it's hackable. but if you are looking for simplicity i programming where you are going go with garmin first then tom-tom. i tried you mr. viamichelin but you need to go to finishing school like the other gps students. you are just too unfinished and rough ",negative

" the pci bus does not have the bandwidth to get you gigabit speed. you will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a pci gigabit card even with jumbo frames. your motherboard has two pci busses and sometimes has three. depending on the chipset and the manufacturer the internal devices like the keyboard/mouse/floppy internal network usb firewire and more will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses. you will have to run sisoft sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the pci bandwidth it can get but that will not be close to gigabit speed either. best case on 33 mhz pci is 300 megabit. even if you can find which pci bus has the fewest bandwidth-consuming devices on it the 33 mhz pci busses in all consumer pcs cannot handle the bandwidth of this (or any) gigabit card anyway. if you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built-in gigabit or get a motherboard with 66 mhz pci pci-x (not pci express) 64-bit pci or similar but you're going to pay lots of money for that. worse yet that built-in gigabit interface might still be on a 33 mhz pci bus and always sharing bandwith giving you less than 300 megabit speed. it probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework ",negative

" i've found the befsx41 (v2.0) to be very problematic. with firmware version 1.50.18 some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes bringing down the entire net. with the newer firmware version 1.52.10 it fixes this problem but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server (passthru tcp port 80) making the router totally unusable. tech support was friendly and helpful and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1.50.18 for our websites and upgrade each time to 1.52.10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking. so now we upgrade/downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week and each time we do it brings down our net. i've also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands. you cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its mac address. instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips. also it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number even though they map to two different computers. this makes it impossible for example to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time ",negative

" i've rarely had bad experiences with microsoft mice or keyboards. usually they tend to have above average design and put thought into the product. they evidently didn't hire the good designer to work on this product however as this mouse has 2 glaring faults. #1: the shallow height and shape of the mouse is such that it offers no support for your hand whatsoever. this causes hand strain and inconsistent hand placement as you use it. you never get the feeling that your hand is in the right position. #2: the side buttons are in brain dead locations. why this is i have no idea as other microsoft models put the left side button right where your thumb would be if you move your thumb up slightly (the way it should be). on this gaming mouse the left thumb button is much too far forward causing you to have to practically re-adjust your grip on the mouse just to press it. couple this with problem #1 and the lack of surface contact with your hand causes the mouse to skew under your hand as you press the button thus turning your player to one side when you didn't intend to. just what you don't want when throwing a grenade. the right button is sort of click-able with your pinky and is actually the more accessible button but it feels more due to luck than planning. i have to wonder if they even tested this design with any gamers at all before putting it out on the street. i give it 2 stars because for the attempt at wireless feel with the thin cord and it looks visually appealing. calling this a gaming mouse however and charging a premium for it is a joke you should spare yourself being the butt of. rating: not recommended ",negative

" consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in samsung dlp televisions. cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing. (as a non-techniocal person i should have no idea what these parts are but alas i bought a samsung dlp) expect these to fail within 1-2 years. expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan. that is if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere. these parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates. you should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized. many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years and some more often than that. the lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty. this cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan. please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years. while i was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my dlp my color wheel failed very early. i called tech support to report a grinding noise and was told to turn it off wait 15 minutes and turn it back on like this would fix the problem. after doing this for a while the color wheel finally failed actually shattered! now i am out of warranty and samsung wants nothing to do with me. i have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors and they are both backordered indefinitely! it has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available. samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand. i have had my tv for 18 months and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time! i have a 42 samsung plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26 crt. both are wonderful products but samsung is selling dlp lemons and will not stand behind them. dlp is a great bargain up front but a maintenance nightmare! you will pay in the long run and by the long run i mean every 2 years. if you still want to purchase a dlp television please buy the extended warranty! it will save you a ton but you will still have to wait for the circuit city tech to find parts which may take months! i expect samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled dlp sector and focus on their beautiful plasma line. expect dlp prices to drop even further but please...look before you leap ",negative

" specs look good. hdmi 1.3a 1080p firmware upgrade over ethernet etc. the unit seems to be solid (heavy) and well built. however toshiba chose to ship this hd-dvd player with only a composite a/v cable (yellow red white rca jacks) in the box. the best resolution you can get with this cable is 480i and not even as good as an s-video connection for that! it is pretty amazing that a high-end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high-definition capabilities and hdmi 1.3a interface is being shipped without a cable set (component video or hdmi) that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an hdtv. i don't know how much cost savings toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than $5. now let's get to the real review: pros: - one of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular dvds to 1080p. the upscaling is very high quality. the unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered dvds. - if the weight of the unit is any indication build quality is high. - it has an ethernet port for firmware updates (and possible future functionality) cons: - very slow boot time. takes longer to boot than my windows xp pc. - especially durimg 1080p hd-dvd playback the unit gets very hot. make sure your enclosure/rack is open in the back. there is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player. - this player has no zoom/scaling functions for dealing with non-anomorphic dvds so you have to use your tvs scaling function. kind of a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers ",negative

" most annoying thing is that i hooked up through hdmi for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the hdmi (i used optical). what the hell is the deal with that? at first i thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your tv or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well. hdmi is supposed to make it more convenient 1 cable etc... why is this necessary??????? secondly my receiver is not working properly. the sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled 99% of the time. running the auto macc fails out manually i see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker????? nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part surround left is silent as it should be. occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out 3 times louder then it supposed to be. adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm. if i select the different output options basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing. i am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as i do think the receiver is nice if its working i enjoy the ipod dock that has output to your tv as well. i major concern is something is wrong with there hdmi circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well. i will update when i get the replacement installed.

" i bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system. i based my decision on information as stated on the pioneer web site and the attractive price compared to some of the other options i considered. this receiver does have a number of good features but has one serious flaw. it will not display on screen status messages for daily operations like volume and sound mode unless you have a pioneer display and run another special cable from the receiver to the tv (as a side note pioneer needs to understand we want to run less cables to our display). that means you only get to see the simple set-up screen on your non-pioneer tv which you will probably use when you first set up the receiver and very infrequently after that. (the set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs and audio calibtraion.) sounds like a small deal but in many home theaters including mine the electronics are not in the line of site (mine are in a closet just outside the theater with an infrared repeater system controlling everything.) this not uncommon many have thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors and it means i have no idea what the volume is what sound mode i am using or anything beyond the set-up menu unless i go into the closet. bad bad bad! this seems to be a marketing ploy by pioneer to get you to buy pioneer tv's and projectors and it is beyond stupid. if this was not the case i would rate this receiver much higher but it is a serious flaw. it makes using this unit extremely tedious and difficult. this limitation also means if you have mulitple displays i have a plasma tv and projector in my theater you need to run thier special cable to both displays and both have to be pioneer. again i have to say bad bad bad! the other features are as stated on the pioneer website but they are lying when they say this unit has on screen display and this will be a major drawback for users that do not have the receiver in the line of site when using thier systems unless they have a pioneer display with sr+. (oh yeah your pioneer display has to be also be equipped with sr+ thier way of linking the two units. if your pioneer display is not equipped with sr+ you are again out of luck. did i mention this is bad?!) 25 feb 2007 - addition to reveiw: i called onecall and they will take unit back but at 15% restocking fee plus paying for shipping both ways. while onecall really did nothing wrong (pioneer is lying about the osd!) it is one of thier vendors and not the customer's fault either and the customer should not pay for this kind of fraud. buyer beware from onecall thier customer service on this one was not good ",negative

" i am glad i purchased my cardscan 700 but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all. my impression is that this is the best product on the market due to its scanning properties which are quite good. there are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place. pros: it does a pretty good job of scanning. the algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive. even cards that catch and rotate as they go through producing a funny smeared image have some of their contents scanned correctly. the superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product. there is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards. operationally the product is especially nice- i can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one glancing at the screen to catch errors. the card image is retained in the record in the cardscan database which is important. cons: 1) the exit path has places that cards can hang up and they can catch as they go through. this happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat so part of the operation is to try to prevent that by straightening out bent corners ahead of time and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck. quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case. 2) although the product retains the image of the business card there's no way to pass that through to outlook or export it to any other format. this is very unfortunate. i could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one except that cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image. why not? it's easy to implement. 3) every time i start the program it harasses me about registering even though i've been specific that i do not wish to. it also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though i've asked it not to do that. it therefore ignores the user wishes. 4) the data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file in a simple text or csv format. there is no way to create an outlook format .pst file which would simplify importing and allow for the future option of including an image. outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record but apparently cardscan folks aren't even close to thinking about this. 5) if i indicate that a data export for a file is destined for outlook the field names are not set up correctly so unless i do some heavy editing of field names nothing much other than the contact name gets across. if i export directly to the running outlook program it isn't perfect but it's close enough to be usable. why did cardscan get one right and not the other?? in neither case can i send the card image over. 6) i was forced to install microsoft .net software even though i intended to do all my exports via files. i didn't get a choice- if i didn't install .net the installer stopped and exited without installing any cardscan software.

" i bought my wife a nuvi 350 for her birthday last august (overall we love the nuvi but the mount...no). the biggest advantage of the nuvi over other gps systems is its portability. unfortunately the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. the cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. when we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days) it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries we have been able to move it). what this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in. the mount and the charging/power wire (which you will also need since it is cumbersome to remove from the mount) are pretty darn expensive ($60-70) which is ridiculous for a portable system ",negative
" i do not think suction cup mounts work very well. this one is no exception. while attaching and detaching my garmin nuvii is easy enough the cup does not support the weight. i was disappointed that a friction bag was not available for my nuvii. however i was able to jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise. i ordered the friction mount removed the screws on the bottom detaching the mounts that would not fit my nuvii and stapled velcro strips purchased at walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount. i have been cross country using this system and it works. the garmin portable friction mount for gps 010-10306-00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself ",negative
" i called garmin tech support yesterday (10/17) did wait about 15 minutes to speak to someone. i called in the morning so it wasn't a long wait. since my nuvi is still under warranty (1 year warranty) i requested a rma for a replacement suction cup mount. the tech asked how it had failed -- mine also had melted to the windshield so i had to rip it off -- and responded like he was very familiar with the problem. he also mentioned the rubber material of the original design was defective and that they had a new rubber material design and would send me a new one. i didn't have to pay for it and should get here in 7-10 days ",negative

" i have the luxury of writing this review a little bit further out in the technology cycle than most of the others so i can say: just get yourself a better wireless router. based on the reviews here several online fora and my own personal experience i can confirm to you that you have about a 30% chance of actually getting this to work and you might get that percentage up a little bit if you keep returning defective ones and trying another. but why bother? at this point there are higher-power routers high-gain directional antennae and there are even products sporting 802.11n which inherently has a better range that -a -b or -g. if you've gotten into a situation where your router is inadequate for your needs research and get yourself a top-notch router with good broadcast power--i would strongly recommend against trying to remedy an inadequate router by trying to add this product to your network. i understand that my suggestion may be more expensive but i am seriously saying that you will avoid wasting any more than necesary of the precious remainder of your time on this earth. definitely hours (if by some miracle everything works on the 12th or 13th try) and probably a couple of days (assuming that after 24 or 25 tries you send back the first one and try again with a new one) ",negative

" amazon was great about shipping this product but i eventually returned it due to several problems. they were also great about the return -- they paid the return shipping and i got a full refund. i never tried any recordings with this card using the media center software that is part of windows mce. i was using it with snapstream beyondtv 4.1. if you record using anything but the best (dvd 720x480) quality level it would crop out part of the picture. this is a known issue that is apparently a driver issue. the latest hauppauge driver did not solve the problem. the other problem i had is that several times when i was recording two programs at the same time one of the recordings had nothing but static for the audio portion of it. i don't know if this was a problem with the card or beyondtv but i think it's probably due to the card. i don't know if i had a defective card or if this is just a problem with all of these cards. i also was not that impressed with the overall quality of the video this card captured. i have hauppauge 250 and 350 cards in a couple of other pcs and the video quality they capture is noticeably better than that captured by the 500 card. after reading some reviews it sounds like this is the case for the 150 card also (and the 500 card is basically just two 150s placed on one card). beyondtv works great with the 250 and 350 cards with none of the issues noted above; but i also only have one tuner card in the pcs that i use these cards in so i can't comment on how well they would work in a dual tuner setup using beyondtv. i returned the 500 card and i instead purchased two visiontek xtasy theater 550 pro cards. thus far i'm not having any of the issues with them in beyondtv that i was having with the hauppauge 500 card -- i can record at a lower quality level with no cropping and i've had no audio issues so far. the quality of the video is also far superior to that captured by the 500 card (although maybe not as good as that captured by the hauppauge 250 and 350 cards).

" so i bought this a couple months ago. at first i was in love. great sound quality and the surround sound aspect works well in fps games. also very comfortable much more so than any other 5.1 headphones i have owned. the initial favorable impression wore of pretty quickly though. first of all the microphone *sucks*. i've seen better microphones on 20$ radio shack headphones. these are gaming headphones and expensive ones at that. you would think the microphone would be at least passable. it isn't. secondly the build quality is pretty bad. within a few weeks the control brick started giving me problems. the sound would go off on one side or the other. a bit annoying. this only happens sporadically and can be fixed by squeezing the sound controller. not quite bad enough for me to seek a replacement but annoying nonetheless. i've also discovered that the headphones are assembled with screws - screws that aren't properly inserted and they have a tendency that fall out. now i have a washer flopping around inside the right headphone and i can't find the tiny screw. so i'll have to either try and repair it myself which means trying to find somewhere i can buy tiny rare screws or have to send it in for repair. i might as well send it in for repair because maybe they could also fix the volume controller... really kind of disappointing for supposedly premium gaming headphones. the microphone is bad enough to almost make it worthless for ventrillo or ts. and the problems with build quality are really unacceptable for headphones of this price. i bought some 5.1 headphones for 40$ a few years back... they only lasted a year but they had none of the issues that the razer has. kind of sad that a cheap chinese imitation is actually of better quality than this expensive crap.

" usually i discount negative reviews. i think people may have sour grapes against a company or not understand how to install or work something. i somewhat tech savvy - i installed our wireless network that took a little doing. i work as a technical recruiter so technology doesn't intimidate me. i like technology. so i had been nudging my husband for a print server so that i could print without going to the printer and plugging in. he came home with this belkin product and went about installing it. usually i like to research before i purchase a product but he wanted to handle this. so he installed it and i went back and checked his work and he had followed the instructions exactly. i know he had some trouble and had called tech support at my suggestion - i would never have gotten the wireless router hooked up without tech support. the only problem is that the printserver doesn't work. so i tried installing the software on my pc and trying to problem solve from there. i called the tech support hotline back and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time. i waited for 2 hours then went out to run some errands. there was still no message from a technician when i returned. this morning my husband needed to get some work done from home. he created a document and knowing that the print server did not work he wired up to the printer to print that way. but now the printer won't respond to the signal so he can't print that way either. so we deleted the belkin software and rebooted the computer. he still can't print. so i went back to my pc and tried to delete the software through the control panel. it won't delete. i am getting an error message. i can't print either. so now i am on hold with belkin customer assistance. maybe it's a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is i swear i hear a little indian accent. that doesn't mean that customer support has been outsourced to india and even if it is that doesn't mean customer support is bad. but my experience with this is that while i can get a real live person on the phone he can't do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back. when i tried to get my problem escalated i overwhelmed him and he put me on hold. i am still on hold. i have been on hold for 35 minutes with no help in sight. i called back from my cell phone and someone who sounded so much like the first operator i spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level 2 technician and someone would call back in 1-2 hours. when i strongly protested asked for his name asked for a number i could call directly he offered to transfer me immediately and now i have been on hold for for an additional 10 minutes on my cell phone. i am starting to sense a trend here. my husband - boiling over his inability to print an important document has gone off to work to print it there. i am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call. i usually discount negative reviews but this is really my experience with this product and if you are considering purchasing it i would encourage you to think that through a little further.

" i purchased the md781 + md71 expansion phone after briefly having its predecessor the md681. i really like the md681 but i could never locate one of its expansion handsets (everyone online/offline was constantly out of stock). overall i'm disappointed with this new model and after two weeks of use i am already looking for another phone. handheld phones: i like them more than any other phone i've tried. unlike most phones these days they're big and have a very solid feel to them...it's just easier to hold onto a phone like this for a longer conversation. the buttons are a nice size and easy to use. the hands free/speak phone on the handheld works well. with one person on a handheld line the sound is pretty good but with two people on handsets you get significant background noise that is so bad it hurts your ear and it's hard to hear the person on the other end of the conversation. the shared phonebook is a terrific idea but it could have been done better. it's a few clicks and slow to access...almost as quick to have the old rolodex on hand...or copy the number to the local units phonebook...which defeats the purpose. as for the answer machine: once you play messages you no longer have a visible indicator of how many messages if any are in the system (is it just me or is that poor design) so if you listen to messages when you partner isn't around you need to leave a note for them to check messages. the quality of voice messages is a bit grainy. i also like how the handset docked in the older m681; it laid on the base so you had the option of wall mounting the base...the md781 sits up on the base like some sort of obelisk.

" i purchased this product to replace a really good 802.11g unit from linksys hoping to set up a gigabit home network with ethernet storage. i initially considered the wrt300n model but the reviews were mediocre. so i went instead for this newer model hoping that linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the wrt300n model. i am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the wrt300n also apply to this model. i am returning it after 5 hours of use. on my home network set up with my current linksys 802.11g unit i am able to stream 4 different movies to four different laptops at the same time throughout the house and all four movies display flawlessly. on this new unit optimized for streaming video i was not able to stream a movie to a single laptop sitting close to the wireless unit. the movie had interruptions every 4-5 seconds. this was worse as the laptop was positioned further from the wireless unit. performance was equally bad with laptops equiped with g cards and n cards. and performance degraded as i tried to stream to multiple laptops at the same time. the speed of the links to my laptops equiped with n cards was 144 mb/s and was 54 mb/s on those equiped with g cards. so the connection seemed fast enough. it might be that by tweaking the wireless unit in some way it might be able to perform as i expect. but i don't have time to waste on such tweaking and given that my 802.11g unit performed flawlessly out of the box there is no point to upgrade to this new flawed model. i'll delay my plans for a gigabit home network until the technology has matured and the bugs have been worked out ",negative

" first of all i am a dyed-in-the-wool techie. i design products like this in my job. i know what every single one of those what the heck is that? settings in router set up screens are. so i do take a bit of umbrage when one reviewer called the many (most) who have had trouble with this router morons. yes i got it to work. it will work right out of the box if used with most pre-n wireless cards and definitely if they are linksys pre-n cards. that covers about 1% of those who would buy this router. after three hours of tweaking a dozen plus of the settings from default i succeeded in getting it to hand-shake with b and g mode cards most of the time. it would still randomly lose the ip requiring rebooting everything. not something my customer would accept nor would i sell. some of the techie specs are a long way from what linksys claims. linksys marketing obviously wrote the specs and ads then engineering tried to design to both. they failed. a non-techie spec important to everyone is range. it has 20% the range of an old b mode linksys router i had sitting right next to it. adding encryption dropped range in half again! the wired router portion of it works out of the box no adjustments required. but you're buying this for the wireless function. yes i could have tweaked some more and probably managed to get it stable enough to live with. but linksys didn't used to be that way. i used to buy only linksys considering my time worth too much to putz around with unreliable equipment to save my customers a few bucks on hardware. this is the third linksys router in a month (the other two were g mode) that have been unstable or doa. then why did i buy this one? it was on sale and i wanted to give linksys one more chance before they lost my business for good. they've now lost it for good. i exchanged the router for a netgear and it worked right out of the box into a network running both b and g mode wireless network cards. plus it was a lot less money. has cisco ruined linksys? got me. did all the good engineers cash out? i wouldn't be surprised. are they rushing unfinished bug-filled product to market to meet quarterly profit numbers for wall street? you bet! i'll stick with netgear and belkin from now on.

" as a musician who's dealt w/ opening many cd packages for many years let me save you some money. you don't need a special tool to open cds. just run the bottom edge of the cd against any solid rough surface (like a sidewalk or concrete wall) a couple of times. the plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie allowing you to take it off effortlessly. getting that pesky sticker that seals the top of the cd off is easy too. again no tools required. you'll notice that the cd cover is hinged at the top & bottom in such a way that you can easily slide the front cover off the back. it just pops in & out held in place by a little bump on one piece that fits in a hole in the other. gently pull the front cover out of its sockets at the top & bottom then bend the whole thing back toward the top of the cd case where the sticker is affixed so that the sticker becomes straightened out. this will let you easily pull off the sticker in one piece. (try peeling the front cover off the sticker rather than vice versa.) and you're done! all you have to do now is just pop the front cover back into its hinges and enjoy. the whole process takes under a minute and you'll still have the money in your pocket that you didn't spend on an iffy cd opening tool to buy another cd with ",negative

" i've owned three of interlink's units but that was before competitors came to market with well-designed units. the interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily; there is no off switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one's pocket; the advance and go-back buttons function most of the time but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2-3 times per 30 minute presentation. although i agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this interlink product better than i do it seems these other reviewers have not compared the interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features. for example the kensington pointer is half the price; the case is sturdy has a no-slip outer coating has a comfortable feel in the hand and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use. placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip. and the advance and go-back buttons function all of the time not just most of the time!

" i bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous $60 at circuit city out of dire necessity. i have never liked monster cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers. i opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection. at their usurious price point i find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore i would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations. thanks to circuit city's return policies i was able to return this junk and get my money back. caveat emptor - cable buyers - spend your money wisely and stop the monster cable insanity ",negative

" i bought this as a backup drive several months ago for my home business after the iomega backup drive i was using crashed and took my backup with it. the maxtor software installs automatically when you plug in the drive so that part was really easy and it took just a few minutes. the initial backup was really easy and went pretty fast too. so far so good. the problem is that once the initial backup takes place the backup function doesn't backup new or updated files! the scheduled backup doesn't work at all. the light flashes so you think it's working but it doesn't backup any new or updated files. the synch is useless too. it's like the backup function. it will synch your files one time but then after that it doesn't synch any of your new or updated files like it's supposed to. it's like it takes a snapshot of your computer at a specific time and that's it. to get around the fact that it won't automatically back up my files i have to manually transfer my files every few days or so which is a real pain as i have to remember what files have been updated and/or are new. i would not buy this product again. it's not an automatic backup drive it's just an external drive that will back up one time but then isn't reliable at all. if you need a backup drive look elsewhere. sorry to say this one is a complete waste of money.

" i bought this router hoping that some of the quality in cisco's excellent enterprise-market routers would have worn off on adopted child linksys. unfortunately my experience has me convinced that linksys is a red-headed stepchild (my apologies to all you red-heads) who has learned very little from its adoptive parent. that being said the router does work out of the box and it is probably about par for current market offerings on home-network routers. my perusals of the dsl reports hardware forums have left me with the impression that all sub-$300 routers on the market suffer their quirks and behavioral anomalies and this one is certainly no exception. pros: this router is configured to work right out of the box. you can pretty much just connect the cables and turn it on and have functional connectivity without ever looking at a configuration screen. the html-based configuration interface is incredibly easy to use. you don't have to learn one single command line to configure this router. default configuration was stealth mode -- meaning the router did not respond to _any_ unsolicited connection requests forming a protective black hole on my ip for most uninvited packets. cons: not all of the features worked out of the box. several of the links in the html command pages simply did not link to anything. strange that linksys would ship the firmware without at least taking 30 minutes to hide the links that don't point to anything. turning on the poorly documented firewall feature causes the router to respond irregularly to unsolicited connection requests. sometimes the router responds port closed to all requests. sometimes it responds port closed to some and port open to others (the set of which does not remain consistent from one trial to the next). never does it maintain the stealth operation of its default configuration (with firewall inactive). i'm not sure how the firewall in this router is configured to behave but my initial tests suggest it is more security hindrance than feature. the router's dhcp functionality works great -- when it works. it mysteriously disengages at random intervals requiring a reboot (and sometimes a flash to factory defaults) to remedy. flashing a new bios image is risky; router failure during a flash means shipping the router back to the manufacturer - or file13 if the warranty is out. for what it's worth i am still using this router. it serves its basic purpose and while its functionality issues are annoying there are workarounds for all of them. i probably will not buy another linksys but the problems with this one aren't annoying enough to warrant a return. -sean hennin ",negative
" as you may have read elsewhere this router has a problem with the gre protocol used by microsoft for their pptp server (see alan bryant's may 27 2004 review). this will stop you using it with the built-in pptp vpn client/server which is provided with windows 2000/xp. here is the text of a complaint i have submitted to linksys... i am attempting to operate a microsoft pptp server behind a befvp41 (firmware 1.41.1). i have pptp pass through enabled and port 1723 forwarded to the fixed ip address of the server but the router refuses to pass the gre protocol used by microsoft (protocol 47). in answer id 737 you suggest forwarding port 47 presumably in a belief that this has something to do with gre. it does not and is therefore not the solution to this problem. gre does not use tcp/udp port 47 it is 'protocol 47' something entirely different. it seems that the the writer of answer 737 has neither tested this scenario nor has a true understanding of the nature of this problem. i and others have investigated this problem extensively using protocol analysers at the client and server ends and can only conclude that the present version of firmware in the befvp41 (1.41.1) is incapable of handling the gre protocol correctly. can you please advise when a fix will be implemented? this is seriously devaluing an otherwise good product. i also suggest that you amend answer 737 as it is misleading and will frustrate others less versed in ip protocols than myself. i await a reply from linksys as i write this review. having said all that if you have no interest in running the microsoft pptp server the befvp41 may do everything else you require. it functions okay as a basic nat router and it's stealth capabilities are good (steve gibson's 'shields up' reports 'true stealth' as long as you forward port 113 to a non-existant host). the in-built ipsec tunneling works well. i am using one to provide permanant tunnels to a number of befsx41's very reliably. the web interface is a little odd at times but it does do the job reasonably and you do get used to it eventually. to summarise: a reasonable basic nat router. very good stealth. ipsec tunneling works okay (at least to other linksys products). microsoft's pptp server will not work with the current firmware version.

" let me start by saying i was excited to get this product for an upcoming ski outing where four of us including two children were going. i imagined myself able to locate the kids when we tried to meet up or find them if we got lost (or god forbid worse). i bought two from amazon and bought two more from a local retailer while waiting for the amazon order to arrive. i took my girlfriend's niece out for a practice run to see how they all worked...five minutes later mine locked up. i went and found my niece...uncle xxxx why does the screen look all funny the units from the local retailer had a problem with the screen locking up...so i exchanged them but then so did the two i got in exchange. i thought perhaps i got a bad batch from the local store but when the amazon units arrived they had the same problem. we took them out for a stroll with some friends from mba school...the unanimous opinion after a few minutes of test use by late 20 year old and early 30s self proclaimed gear lovers...dude these %&#!. forget locating the people in your party even if all your friends are incredibly patient geeks. (i should know i was so excited when i ordered the radios that i applied immediately for a gmrs license with the fcc). the rino 530's simply don't work well. a combined gps and family radio seems like such a great concept for a product but at $400 a unit they are pathetic. $1600 for four units bought me disappointment frustration trips to the store and time on the phone with customer service agents who act surprised that there is a problem. frankly the gps is useless because the screen flips out every seven minutes. you have to stop remove the belt clip and take the battery off the back and reboot...then it happens all over again a few minutes later. the product becomes a real distraction instead of an enhancement to your outdoor activity...you wind up thinking how great it was when you had $20 radios that worked. i spoke with three garmin reps who denied they knew of any problem one told me it was a complicated piece of equipment and occasional crashes were to be expected. every seven minutes? come on windows 95 was more stable than that. finally i got a guy on the phone who said oh yeah there's a problem with the 530's you should avail yourself of the local return policy if you can. if not we can send you some more but i can't make any promises. he explained that they are having an issue with the electric signal to the lcd and said they are trying to develop a firmware solution. reading the other reviews i'd guess they've been unsuccessfully working on one for more than a year now...and through multiple software releases. i am not holding my breath for working a firmware repair. i've certainly bought products that had bugs and got better with firmware releases (linksys routers for instance palm treo's) but this is no $50 router (or generally stable $400 phone) and frankly i have to reset my router once every four months at most. this product is really bad i wish it were better because the concept is great but i would strongly urge anyone considering this purchase to keep your money and save yourself the headache.

" pro --- * compact enough to fit into a jacket pocket yet opens to a comfortable working size with full-sized keys including a number row. for those who do serious number entry to spreadsheets this is decidedly a deal-maker over the stowaway keyboard which requires alt-key combinations to access numbers and symbols. the full-size keys require no revamping of typing habits as does the miniaturized key spacing on the freedom keyboard. to my knowledge there is no other folding bluetooth keyboard on the market at the time of this writing which has *both* full-size keys *and* a number/symbol row. * the bluetooth connection is clean lag free and accurate. con --- * the software for gaining a connection is a bit cumbersome requiring entry of a checkmark into a box with each use and then an access code on a second screen with each battery replacement (see below). * flimsy locking mechanism / not usable on a lap. the manual tells us that a lock is provided to keep the opened keyboard flat while on your lap or on a non-flat surface. this lock is a single piece of wire about the thickness of an undone paperclip which travels 7/8 along the top of the board from the left half into the right. even when locked the keyboard doesn't lay flat and with the center of the board hovering over the empty chasm between the user's legs held in place only by one thin piece of wire the two halves bend to an increasingly exaggerated v shape after any amount of light-handed typing. hp could have saved themselves the trouble of this useless bit of cosmetics. a user must find a solid flat surface to type on such as a book. and of course when sitting on a flat surface the lock isn't needed. * the manual correctly tells us that one reason to use a wireless keyboard is to enjoy the convenience of a wireless bluetooth connection up to 7 meters away from your...pocketpc. unfortunately the designers ignored this consideration when conceiving the non-removable cradle. a quick look at the freedom keyboard's pull-out cradle offers hp a lesson in how to do it right. * the keyboard ships with no case as do most other portable keyboards with non-rugged exteriors. the attractive brushed metalic exterior of the folded case thereby scratches easily in a jacket pocket containing loose change or a set of keys. * it doesn't turn off. yes you read that last bullet correctly: you can't turn this thing off. there's no power switch. the button in the upper right corner of the keyboard is to establish and disengage the wireless connection between the software and the handheld; it's not a power switch. what this means is even when folded and not in use even when appearing to be dormant and even when the software shows that there's no bluetooth connection the keyboard is still eating your batteries. the automatic sleep mode simply disables the wireless connection; it does not power down the keyboard. two weeks after putting in a fresh set of batteries and not using the keyboard you'll return to find them dead. not the coolest way to walk into a meeting full of executives expecting you to take notes. the only way to power down the keyboard is to open the battery cover and remove the batteries. the battery cover need i add breaks easilly. sound unbelievable? go to the major websites dedicated to pocketpcs and do a search of their forums using the keywords bluetooth keyboard. this is not a case of a know-nothing customer who needs to read the manual. the manual such as it is makes no mention of an absent power switch. for the mobile user then in addition to the keyboard itself one need also travel with something stable to rest the board on to have something to prop the handheld against if distance is desired to carry the batteries separately and to re-enter the access key into the software after reinserting those batteries. although the folded board will fit easily into a jacket pocket the additional loose paraphernalia negates any usefulness of this mobile keyboard for the mobile user. add to that the marred exterior and bent lock after minimal use the hp ipaq keyboard is worth perhaps 1/3 it's $100 retail price and then only if a consumer absolutely requires the full-size keys and number row. how hp ever expected anyone to sit still for this kind of idiocy eludes me. all potential buyers of ipaq handhelds should take this keyboard as a reflection of what if any emphasis hp places on quality of design and the integrity of ipaq name. it reflects also the degree of respect hp has for the intelligence of their customers. one might easily forgive a negative design attribute like the non-removable cradle or the parsimony of not including a case. one might even forgive the useless locking mechanism. but when hp is either too dumb to include an on/off switch or they expect us to be so dumb to not notice or care then i must seriously doubt the usefulness of other products bearing the ipaq name. if hp is content to offer this marginally useful toy to consumers for $100 then i cannot believe enough magic exists in the world to suddenly make them sharp enough to produce a sophisticated device like a pocketpc for $300-400. my next handheld upgrade i'll probably stay with fujitsu-siemens loox (i currently use a loox720 a truly excellent ppc) or maybe go with a dell axim. i won't even consider an ipaq. the hp bluetooth keyboard is quite simply an offense to any consumer with even the vaguest and most forgiving sense of quality. those at hp responsible for protecting public perception of the ipaq brand name should be truly ashamed of themselves.

" after using my im716s for about 4 months now i have a few things to say about them. 1) price: lists for $199 on altec's site. $70 is a steal. 2) quality: top notch in the earphones the clip on the volume module is weak. 3) performance: bar none best i've had. these things outperform the huge logitech ear muff set i use mainly to mow in. these things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower. 4) conclusion: the only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way. when moving around you need to have it clipped to something otherwise it can create inner ear noise. this can get quite annoying. i've also caught the cord on things causing the clip to bend away from the module. it is removeable and i was able to bend it back. if there were a pair of equal quality w/o the module even for the same price i'd go that route. with that said i am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my 60gb video ipod ",positive

" i installed this unit on my hp amd 64 x2 with a 19-inch lcd monitor. installation was very straightforward with no problems experienced. the unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total. all are surge protected but only one row has battery backup. each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets. the unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line and interacts well transparently my dsl service. the unit comes with a usb connector cable that is used to transfer information between the unit and the computer. also included is powerchute personal edition software. this software replaces the ups option used under the power icon of widow's xp control panel. powerchute pe allows user selection of alarms and power options to best fit the user's needs. powerchute pe automatically loads at computer startup and resides as an icon on the right-side of the window's task bar. it monitors the unit's status and provides information concerning abnormal power events that have occurred for future reference. in order to assure that there is enough battery power for this unit to operate properly i only attached the pc and monitor to the powered row of outlets. transformers seem to use a lot of power and to gain the most time available for adequate shut-down times they should only be plugged into the surge only outlet row. when a/c power fails the unit immediately picks up the power load. it will then begin to shut down the pc if a/c power does not become available shortly . the default method it uses is to place the pc into hibernation mode saving the desktop exactly as is for future start-up. it accomplished this task with my pc perfectly. if i had wanted a ups to keep my computer running for several minutes during an a/c power outage this is not the unit i would have purchased. however to keep my system from re-booting due to the power being interrupted momentarily or to shut down the pc safely should the power outage last longer this is a cost-effective solution for those tasks.

" this is a great card reader for the price. why pay more if this one reads the all cards that you have? personally i only use compactflash and sd cards. it reads these cards and it does it fast and reliably. the shape of this card reader is a bit awkward but then again it does help you grab the unit while inserting and removing cards which you'll want to do a bit carefully. it would be a bit more difficult to do that with the unit lying flat on the desk. remember to never force the card in and remember the label side faces towards the sandisk logo on the card reader. it is slightly tricky to get the cards into the slots at first but once you get the feel of it it beccomes quite easy and routine. this sandisk has led indicators that are helpful. one amber led to tell you the unit is connected to your usb and other green ones by each card slot to let you know either that you have a card insert (solid green) or that it's reading or writing (blinking green). this card reader comes with a 1 year warranty and i feel it represents a good value. i would recommend it ",positive

" i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play. i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it. it's the best-feeling keyboard i've ever owned. the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature. the backlighting is bright day or night and the programmable g-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past. highly recommended ",positive

" title: intuos3 tablet publisher: wacom publish date: unknown isbn/model #: ptz631w reviewer: robert saucier rating: 5 stars in 1997 after buying a new top-of-the-line 450mhz pentium ii system i splurged on a wacom artz ii tablet. oh my! pressure-sensitive tilt-sensing pointer control assignable function pads; it was heaven. after a couple of years every time i tried to use it with my primary graphics application my computer would spontaneously reboot -- a bit counter-productive. i watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but as technology marched on my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats. sadly i disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away. lately i've been feeling the pull once more that urge to use a pen to do photo touch-ups instead of my mouse. miraculously a wacom intuos3 6-inch by 11-inch tablet dropped almost literally into my lap. sleek gun-metal gray sexy -- with a comfort-grip pen (much like my coveted pilot g2 pens) and a mouse! even better the intuos3 comes bundled with 3 applications that show off its capabilities: adobe elements 4.0 corel painter essentials 3 and nik color efex 2.0 le. heaven just got better! the intuos3 has over 5000 lines per inch of resolution over twice that of the wacom graphire product line and with its usb 2 connection there's more than enough communication bandwidth meaning better tablet to application response. one hesitation i have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system; will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else. the intuos3 driver has been rock-solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me. i've used all of my usual programs and have had no problems at all. the tablet has also been peacefully co-existing with two external drives a wireless desktop receiver a card reader a scanner and a printer all riding the same usb bus. the intuos3 has 8 chordable buttons 4 at each side of the tablet to which keys macros or other actions may be assigned. the default for each group are the usual alt ctrl/command and shift along with space. the placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet holding one or more of the buttons while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand. being chordable you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like alt-ctrl-s or to the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well. the default setting is to scroll or depending on the context. the ends of the strip in keystroke mode can be set to playback macros. the pen with its 1024-level pressure-sensitive stylus and eraser also has a duoswitch. the duoswitch's two positions may also be programmed. the pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib -- there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback. with the ergonomic grip the pen is extremely comfortable to hold. the 5-button mouse designed to be used by either righties or lefties is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility this is more than acceptable. as with every other clickable/pressable feature associated with the intuos3 the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options although i've yet to find the fix photo illustrate article or even the design website settings. i can see only two very minor changes that i would make to this fantastic product. i would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen. it is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already this feature would be the feather on the cap to me. the other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the graphire (and was on the artz ii). sometimes having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time. for the casual home user i would recommend the graphire product line -- this intuos3 model's srp of $369 may be a bit high where a $99 entry point on the graphire is more affordable. for the pro-consumer or professional however whether doing photo editing (my primary use) or illustration the intuos3 line is well worth the investment. it's great to be in heaven again ...

" if you want a budget home theater system for under $200 there is probably not many systems better then the sony ht-ddw700. this system is ideal for small rooms such as a bed room or a tiny living room. considering the price sound quality is actually better then expected for me. the tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity. they may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't and are a bit heavier then they look. the center channel may be a little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound a tad soft and a little too low. the surround effects during movies in dolby digital and dts are very good though. if set up properly the speakers handle surround effects very well. some minor complaints is that the speaker wire attached to the speakers are very thin. they are fixed and can't be replaced. also if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not be for you. the 8 subwoofer is okay considering the price of the system. it is currently better then any other sub included in a home theater system under $200. it isn't powered is very light (only 9 lbs) and you have to be pretty close to actually feel the bass. the volume would have to be cranked up extremely high for the sub to actually rattle your walls. the receiver comes with 1 optical and 1 coxial digital input and 4 rca analog inputs. it should be enough in most cases. an extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again the system is under $200. setup couldn't be easier. you just hook up the included microphone place it at your listening postion and press a button on the remote. the system will automatically sets up the speaker distance delay and volume levels. the receiver comes with the basic pro logic ii music and move modes to upmix your stereo sources. it also has other sound fields and effects to enhace the sound but they don't really seem to enhance the sound by that much if at all. basically if you want a home theater system for a small room and for under $200 then there isn't much better then the sony ht-ddw70 ",positive
" i've owned many sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy walkmen useful shortwave and portable radios stylish tvs and high quality cassette recorders. i still have a sony mini component stereo model fh-e656 (made in japan) which i bought in 1992 for us$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out cd player i decided to purchase this new sony mhcec70 component stereo (made in china). pluses: decent sound good functionality easy set-up and intuitive operation simple remote -- but only covers basic functions cons: very short speaker leads unattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox only holds 3 cds vs 5 for comparable panasonic units at first glance i was disappointed by the cheap construction skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies. but then i thought: in 2006 for $150 i can't expect the same quality as i received in 1992 for $400. everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in china. so for the money it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom. the real test will be how long the cd changer works -- to be safe this time i bought the 2 year replacement warranty. i haven't blasted it at full volume but it seems to have plenty of power when needed. i originally bought a $300 panasonic unit (sc-pm71sd mp3 sd micro system) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by drm limitations). this sony stereo costs half as much and has almost all the same functionality ",positive

" after looking around at the local stores (fry's and compusa) i had just about given up on finding a single case that would offer reasonable protection for my ipod in multiple environments - on my belt and also in exercise and had resigned myself to having a skin type case for just everyday use and then shifting the ipod to an arm band for exercise. not a particularly great solution - expensive (around $20 for each) and a lot of shifting back and forth to cover both uses. then i ran into the dlo action jacket at best buy which seemed to cover all my intended uses. unlike the prior reviewer i found my 40g ipod fits very snugly - absolutely zero slop and i really like not having to worry about keeping up with more than one case. also at $29.95 it's cheaper than the two-case approach. the only criticism i have of this jacket is that when you want to convert from belt clip to sport use you have to snake the band through two loops on the backside of the case and over the little plastic belt clip receiver that protrudes from the back of the case. the process is a little tedious but the end result is great. the unit feels very secure on my arm and it's easy to forget that it's there. this jacket is a winner ",positive
" we've had this printer for almost two years. i do a good amount of printing both color & b/w. while i do need to do cleanings more often with this printer mine is not sucking up ink at an unreasonable rate at all. and it is very affordable. photos don't always print well... the only photo paper i have found to work well with my s530d was very the glossy trial pack that came with it when i bought it. no other photo paper has done well at all so i suggest theirs. this is the best printer we have had in 10 years and belive me i've thrown my share out the window! i can offer this advice to owners of any printers. always use the power switch on the printer to turn it on off never use the power strip switch or the switch from properties. for some reason doing so supposedly wastes ink? i don't get it but i've always followed that advice and this printer has been an absolute gem for us. good luck! jeanni ",positive

" i have two seperate units. one hardwired to my car and the other is the jvc unit. i hooked it directly into the audio (aux) ports of my radio rather than use an fm station. it works great the sound quality is excellent as well - (and my radio is so old it play's 8-tracks!!!!). i did notice that the unit tends to run a bit warm to hot. i agree with the previous reviews that it is something that jvc needs to look into perhaps it is simply a matter of a heat sink-er not being in specs as yet i have encountered no problems (having had the jvc unit for 1.5 years) no matter. as to the commercial free: sirius (which i have had a subscription to for the past 4 years) has commercial free radio though the news stations and a few others do have commercials. those stations are clearly defined as being in the commercial block. the music stations are 100% free of commercial. all in all a damn cheap price to pay for avoidance of all those really irritating dj's commerical's and lack of variety in stations! ~cheers!

" i had owned an lg burner and from the time i got it it never worked right. i must have made 60 or 70 coasters before i decided that it was'nt the media it was the crappy lg brand burner. i was really afraid because there are so many burners on the market and all of them claim to be good but as i found out with my lg experience that is not always true. my brother has an older model sony burner and although his is slow it has made a handful of coasters in the 5 years that he has owned it so i took a chance and purchased the sony dru-810a. that was the best decision i could have made. i will never buy another brand burner other that sony brand. i have had this burner about 7 or 8 months. i am a very heavy burner and i have not made one coaster. one thing i loved about my brother's sony burner is that i could use any brand of media. the same thing is true of the dru-810a. i don't have to worry about where the media was manufactured or who the maker is. this burner loves everything. i had looked at the plextor brand but i did'nt want to pay $100.00 and i looked at nec brand liteon benq. etc. but i am so happy that i passed on them all and got the sony. it burns super fast. some people say that it is loud but it's not loud to me. i got my burner from tiger direct for $50.00. my sister's computer came with a crappy lg brand burner too and for almost 2 years she has not been able to burn at all because she gets nothing but coasters too so for christmas i am buying her a sony dur-810a so she can finally burn some movies. for my money this is the best burner bar none.

" look for a bargain-basement product what do you expect? first you expect it to work and i can confirm it definitely does work. when plugged in to usb it signals xp correctly. the driver software is very tolerant. you can install it at any time and there is never a resource conflict or problems with the system recognizing the device. so installation is a 5 minute process. next comes the capture and initial encoding. well the software is a bit lame as far as features and gui. typical. but it absolutely saves in mpeg2 / dvd format just as you'd need it to for making dvds of all your dish network or ps2 or vhs content. the frame rate is full on 30 fps. it takes an svideo or standard rca video signal. both are just fine in quality. the resolutions are not that great... but its passable for dvd when you crank it up. don't think you can encode some blu-ray quality mpeg with this though. as far as the overall durability of the product i've literally left mine plugged into the wall and running for about 1 year straight. it gets hot but its never so much as flickered or needed reset. bottom line? this thing is like a kids toy- its cheesy but tough as nails. get it for your first analog signal mpeg encoder. its a good value.

" after doing a fair amount of internet research about mp3 players and their features i was under the impression that i would go with an ipod. having been in the computer industry for almost 15 years i have never been fond of the mac and have always been a little biased towards pc's. this added to my reticence to own a mac product and the growing complaints about service on the ipod being a 'bit' over priced i forged on. i started reading through all of the reviews i could find on the internet and as always found a wealth of them here on amazon. to my dismay all the reviews i could find on product names i knew absolutely trashed the products they were reviewing which scared me immensely. thats is until i got to the iaudio line. the reviews were almost all positive and the complaints that were present were things i could easily overlook. i love the control i am big guy with big hands and i have rarely if ever pushed the control and not had the result i was intending. i have had my iaudio x5 for over a month and i have nothing bad to say in the least. i am an avid linux user and it works flawlessly with linux the sound quality is phenomenal except the ear buds that came with mine have a lot of static in them so get rid of those. the fm tuner is great (you wont get that on an ipod). i travel a lot and i pipe my x5 through my car stereo using a cassette tape converter plugged into the stereo out port. what else can i say this is a great product with great features and it looks good too! i also bought a case from zcover which fits the purpose but i think that as time goes on some better more versatile cases will come to market. a satisfied custome ",positive
" i bought this keyboard originally for the lcd screen and the wide range of possibilities that exist with programming it for various games i play. i was suprised to learn that this is more than a pretty keyboard with an lcd hanging off of it. it's the best-feeling keyboard i've ever owned. the keys take just the right amount of pressure to operate and the switch to disable the windows key is a welcome feature. the backlighting is bright day or night and the programmable g-keys make executing complicated key combinations in games or business applications a thing of the past. highly recommended ",positive
" this is a great piece of hardware the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me. but in my apartment i would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker it's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself. the bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default. the other thing is that i would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer. that's not going to happen with this system you can't change that easily. and yes the 5 disk changer is slow. the maximum volume setting doesn't seem that loud to me but then i have the decibal settings at default. all the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here it has all the flavors. hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way i'd like it too but i only tried rca and not the digital. i have a sony 32 wega and i had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the dav-fx100 reciever. that works like a charm even with 5.1 sound from xbox. one huge complaint i have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best. i see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my tv. there is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual! beware! four stars ",positive

" you may as well pitch the instructions because they're worthless (and the only reason i'm not giving a 5-star rating for the ads tech video xpress). i was about ready to pitch the product as well after losing two evenings trying to figure out how to get it to work. ultimately i gave up on relying solely on the program it came with and i instead opted to try it on my windows movie maker. yahoo! perseverance paid off! once i switched to movie maker this tool worked great! to date i've converted about a dozen videos of content to computer files that i was able to burn to dvds. i just leave my xpress hooked up to the back of my television so i don't have to try to remember later how to hook it up again. doing that i can connect my laptop to the xpress and start the video converting process within 3-4 minutes. my movie maker program takes over the entire process. the ads tech video xpress has been especially useful for me because i teach a college telecourse and often show edited video clips to my students. before purchasing xpress i had crudely edited videos that i was reluctant to use; my videos had lots of amateur stop/start points. using movie maker with xpress i was able to download these videos to my laptop then easily edit them so transitions between stop and start points became smooth and seamless. pretty cool. i'm glad i took a chance on this product! below are hook-up and program instructions i've written to myself for easy reference later. hopefully they'll be of more help to you than the instructions that come with this product: first hook up the video xpress equipment as follows: 1. s-cable (buy one since it doesn't come with the videoxpress) goes from the back of your television to the videoxpress. 2. use red/white/yellow cords running into the back of the vcr/dvd that is hooked up to your televion as follows: - all three plug into the video out column - all three plug into the videoxpress tool at the other end. 3. the usb plug for the videoxpress tool plugs into the back of the computer. next open the instant video xpress program and verify the settings are as follows: - ntsc m for the video standard setting - 640 x 480 and 60 fps (vga) for video format - dvd vcr tv for video source - video composite for video input under the program advanced settings: - low motion (tv vcd dvd) - cpu support: sse3 - stereo system: mts - video decoder: video standard: ntsc_m under properties within the program advanced settings: - stream format: video format: ntsc_m - frame rate: 59.940 - color space/compression: yuy2 - outputs size: 640x480 finally close the instant video xpress program. (windows movie maker can't access the video until this program is closed. and yes it's silly to have to open it make those setting changes then close it but video xpress won't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps.) in case you need this information for windows movie maker the steps (in order) are as follows: under file click on capture video. use the following settings: - audio device set at: usb2.0 analog audio device - video input source set at: composite under configure video capture device: - video format: video standard: ntsc_m frame rate: 29.970 color space/compression: yuy2 output size: 640x480 under camera settings: - deinterlace method: low motion (tv vcd dvd) - cpu support: sse3 - stereosystem: mts under video decoder: video standard: mtsc_m signal detected: 1 lines detected: 525 then... give the file a name and indicate where to save it set it for best quality for playback. then start capture. if the video xpress is hooked up and running correctly you should see on your computer monitor the video image of whatever is showing on television but you will not hear the sound. when you finish capturing and play it back then you'll hear the sound. i know i know -- clear as mud. but hey it's better than the xpress instructions! :- ",positive

" (note to brian: the wap54g *can* be configured as a bridge. i have two of them in just such a configuration. took me about 10 minutes to set them up.) major modes of operation are: 1. wireless access point (its default set-up) 2. wireless client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the wap54g and you now have a wireless ethernet device) 3. wireless repeater (extend range of wireless coverage) 4. wireless bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a virtual cable; you need two to get the job done) a pair of wireless bridges is just what i needed but hesitated to buy the wap54g because of brian's comment that this wouldn't work. because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that brian was wrong. i bought a pair and they do work. i rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons. 1. i understand that higher-end more expensive equipment can be had with more range than this box. gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment! 2. one must dig very deeply into the users guide (a pdf on the cd) to find the default ip address in order to configure this device. luckily i had read elsewhere what that ip address is (192.168.1.245). other manufacturers make this info readily available even going so far as printing it on the device itself. this will be critical info to any linux user. also the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is admin. well it's not. the only allowed userid is an empty field. this had me going for a few minutes. 3. something that 99% of the world won't care about -- i like to have more access to the firmware. for example other linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. i think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this ",positive
" this card is the 2 gb ultimate 120x it has a tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second. frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed which is always much faster. analyze your file size for pictures you take and the speed in mb/sec will tell you how many of those pictures you can store in one second. that impacts time between pictures. for cameras write speed is the most important but the speed rating of the card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed. for music players and other devices read speed may be more important. so you might choose a different card depending on whether you intend to use it to play music or take pictures. i'm currently shopping for sd cards for a camera with the capability to shoot 3 pictures per second with large file sizes. in order not to slow the camera down i need a fast card. i have done some research and realized that the reviews here aren't necessarily even related to this particular card but are for all different sizes and speeds of kingston cards. kingston has been in the memory business for a long time and they are conservative in their ratings. this card is #1 on my list right now because of its tested write speed ",positive

" i bought this model in order to be rid of my almost-new sony mhcec70 with its faulty ergonomics and detestable tuner. having once owned an earlier pm-series model this new panasonic was the obvious choice and it does not disappoint. like its predecessor the pm53 is a nice powerful compact stereo with (for the money) ridiculously nice audio quality and a good tuner especially on the fm band. it can easily be turned up load enough to cause hearing damage and annoy neighbors in adjacent houses. the remote covers every function and is easy enough to figure out without consulting the manual. right now this is the budget stereo of choice for the discerning. sony's competing models are cheesy-looking (hog attention on store shelves) bigger (i.e. take more materials/cost more to ship) and consequently suffer certain cost-cutting measures like the aforementioned crappy tuner and simplified (and of course proprietary) antenna connector. it's like choosing between the pontiac and the toyota. the sony is for the unwashed rubes who want 300 watts of mylar-coated bling. the panasonic is for people who want something that makes pleasant sounds and looks like the rest of the furniture.

" i have had my handspring visor deluxe for 5...yes five years (actually longer). while i take decent care of it it has taken care of me. my doctor has one too...exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to. i finally ordered a new pda with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it. (i'm not selling it...good karma) down to business - the handspring visor deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore. but in its day it was. great product and if you don't need the bells and whistles (or color display)...go for this. totally flawless. people often complain about the styli of other pdas. no complaints here. not only is it relatively comfortable it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends (doesn't break) and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device. i literally lost my original stylus just a few days ago. the display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun (heck a good deal of the new ones don't have ir)... go for it. and for the price i just saw it listed for on amazon ($85) it's a total steal. great product ",positive

" this is our first lcd tv. our tube tv finally died. my wife actually picked out this unit and consumer reports also recommended this unit. we purchased it directly from amazon on january 23 2007. i wanted to wait a couple of months before i write my review to see if anything happens. but to my surprise the tv is still running and there have been no problems. we have digital hd and the pictures are great. it took me a couple of weeks to get use to watching tv with such sharp color and contrast. however if you are watching normal digital programming you may not be too happy as it is flat. but overall its a good buy for us ",positive
" i researched tvs for a long time before i ended up buying this set. it helped that costco offered a coupon for $300 off the price ($1000 final price). i thought i may not like the tv so i decided to buy in person as opposed to online to help with a potential return. however there is no way i am returning this tv; it's awesome. the picture is great and that is just with sd. the strech feature makes the regular 4:3 picture fit the screen and not look distored. i was worried about buying the 37 tv and then having to watch with the black bars on the sides to avoid distortion. but there is no need with this tv since sharp has figured out how to strech the picture without distortion. dvds look incredible on this tv as well. what is even better is the built-in hd tuner. i was debating upgrading my cable to the hd package but i decide to spend $13 on rabbit ears from target. oh my once i plugged in the indoor antenna and let the tv track for digital stations i was amazed. the analog station popped up like a fierce snowstorm in winter but when i went up to the hd digital companion station i couldn't believe my eyes. an incredible hd picture with the rabbit ears set on my desk...indoors no less! why would i upgrade my cable tv to the hd package when they can't offer the local stations in hd? especially when they are free with a simple antenna! i was told this was possible but quite frankly i was skeptical. not anymore i am so glad i got the sharp that has the built-in tuner. i seriously considered just buying the hd ready tv monitor and upgrade through my cable provider. boy am i glad that i didn't do that. if you are in the market for a very nice tv that is easy to use and provides a great picture i would highly recommend this set. ",positive
" this is a great product. it was easy to mount and looks great. the only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall but from what i have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches. i have a 32 lcd mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so i always try to keep it closer to the wall but every time i come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees. this hasn't caused any problems and i'm sure this is well within its design strength. highly reccommended ",positive
" this is a high quality precision made piece. i'm very particular about the construction of things that i buy and this peerless arm more than met my expectations. it was easy to attach to the back of my 32 lcd television and equally easy to mount to the wall. i read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble. not so here. everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen. all hardware is included along with clear complete instructions. i'd be surprised if you could find something better ",positive

" this card using via's superb envy24 ht chipset is a huge improvement over my realtek and via envy24ht-s based cards. everything sounds better. my old audigy 2 platinum (which i think i shall melt) did better in 3d games but only slightly. since this card doesn't snap crackle and pop like the creative cards do i'll venture to say that it actually does make games better since there are no weird noises distracting from the feel of the game. pros: * very high audio sampling rates allowing for incredibly good audio production; warm rich warm bass all the way up to crystal clear highs. * no crackling popping or hissing! a real joy after pulling my hair out for years trying to figure out why creative labs cards keep doing this. * well-maintained solid drivers. * supports eax 2.0 * excellent asio support. cons: * no hardware support for directsound; however if your machine is faster than about 1ghz you probably won't notice the difference. benchmark your results on a machine made in the last three years and you'll find that no hardware directsound acceleration amounts to *less* than a 1% difference in speed. * only supports up to eax 2.0 due to creative labs refusing to license the technology. sound difference is minimal though ",positive

" i ordered a pair of these online a bit nervous as i wasn't ever able to hear them (i heard a pair of jbl sp6c's the cheaper version at best buy and wasn't all that impressed although it might have been the poor listening environment). anyway the speakers arrived we installed them (they look great and inconspicuous in our living room ceiling) and i'm quite impressed. note that we're using these for whole-house background music not home theater so my standards aren't as high as they would be in the ht case. but for a 6.5 speaker these put out a surprising amount of bass and clear highs. right now we just have a cheap amplifier hooked up while we're shopping for a better one and they still sound great. these probably would be just fine for ht rear-speaker use (i wouldn't want any in-ceiling speaker for front or center ht use). our home theater downstairs already has jbl speakers (studio series for the fronts and center northridge for the rears) and i've been very happy with them. i recommend these for those who need a great looking and decent sounding in-ceiling speaker without breaking the bank.

" the product works well for my space and needs. one note to amaazon. when you ship a $400 item thats semi fragile and the box shows up looking like it was used as a make shift soccer ball how does the consumer deal with physical damage? the item is so massive to ship back and most likey costly. i experimented with buying an expensive electronic online because the price was right. i was worried how the shipping would be handled and sure enough i was worried rightfully. the dvd tray catches everytime the tray comes in and goes out. the top of the receiver/dvd player had been slightly caved in. even with all the packing samsung supplied it could not protect the product from the shipping company. it will be such a hassle to try and exchange this that i am not sure if i will be purchasing something this expensive and fragile online again. other than that i have purchased smaller items and less fragile from amazon with no issues. i realize that the shipping damage canot be held on amazon as it is out of their control. i just don't think i will roll the dice on something like this in the future. too bad it would have been nice to say good buy to brick and mortar pressure salesmen ",positive

" this is a surprisingly good radio at this price. it is small compact and yet very robust and quite heavy. it is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store. here are three things i really liked about this product: 1) the am/fm reception is outstanding. i am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear. listening to fm on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure. 2) the buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function. this is something sangean seems to get very well. 3) the multi-level display lighting can be turned off or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright. a few things i didn't like. the pilot light for on is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night. i had to put black electrical tape over it. the aux input is a mini-jack instead of rca connector. minor inconvenience here. and finally the cabinet is nice wood but the finish is not as good as i think it could be. this radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than i expected for this price. it's a keeper ",positive

" i had an old palm m100 for the longest time and used it as an electronic replacement for a paper organizer. but it ate batteries and wasn't rechargeable so when i got a newer computer without a serial port (and discovered it would cost a fairly decent sum for a serial-usb connector) i decided to upgrade. thought it'd be cool to have something with mp3 playing capabilities as well (i don't own an ipod or other small mp3 player) but i didn't need many features beyond an organizer (didn't need for e-mail etc) and didn't want to spend much over $75. pros: i like the palm interface very intuitive. calendar & contacts work well plays mp3's syncs well with outlook/computer plugs in to recharge; all cords came with it. easy to download new software (i recommend blocks it's similar to tetris) cons or caveats: display: when viewing calendar in full month mode i have trouble seeing any entries unless i view the screen at an angle. not a deal-breaker but a little odd. they probably improved this with newer (pricier) models but you get what you pay for. i can read all other screens just fine. haven't used it to display photos; i don't think i'd use this to do that--resolution isn't worth the effort. expansion card: warning: will not read any card over 1gb size! (i had purchased a 2gb card with the intent of putting mp3's on it and listening to them on the zire. wouldn't read it. didn't realize this till i read the fine print. fortunately i have a camera which takes sd cards so i can use in the camera). listening to mp3's: this really isn't gonna replace an ipod for features. they do say that listening to mp3's uses more battery than other functions. i would agree but then i've not used this for long periods of time as an mp3 player so i can't really say. functionally mp3's play just fine with realone player. sound quality is pretty good but i have noticed a hiss background noise when using earbud-style headphones; it's a lot less noticeable with outside-the-ear style headphones. recommendation: outside-the-ear style headphones with an in-line (cord) volume control. if you're in a quiet environment the lowest volume level on the realone player isn't all that soft. with non-volume-adjustment headphones the lowest volume level (there's a slider bar on screen) was the loudest i wanted to hear. headphones with a volume adjustment fixes that problem. overall it's been worth the $$ for me as a replacement for my former m100 and it works ok as an mp3 player as long as you can recharge it on a regular basis ",positive

" a couple years ago i got a projector for the big screen effect and decided to finally get my mini advents out of storage for the surround sound. my old pioneer receiver worked ok but i decided it was time to upgrade. i have 30 year old speaker lab (build 'em yourself) speakers up front with the advents in back. the only complaint i have with this unit is there is no way to connect a turn table (yes i'm old). so i kept the pioneer for dedicated service to the record player. i have my son hook everything up as he is taking networking in school. for him it's a breeze. i don't even look at the directions. i just say here. having said that; i think this thing is great! if you are my age and can go back 30 years to your first sound system you paid a lot more to get a simple 200 watt system (wow) for your records and cassettes. ahh.... technology. i love this thing! i can understand that some folks want something better but for 95% of us this will be the last one you will ever need. highly recommended. 4 stars for the lack of lp connection. otherwise.... 5 all the way ",positive

" there are some things i like about this others i don't. some people have written similar reviews but i want to add my 2 cents. hope this helps potential buyers. likes: 1. small easy to use 2. good sound quality 3. good storage capacity for those of us who don't have 10 million songs hanging out on our computers. 4. some people have complained that the creative media software is hard to understand. i disagree i found it straightforward. you can even change the titles artists and genres of the songs on the software before it gets transferred to the player. yes i realize this can also be done in wmp but sometimes you want to edit later or you missed something earlier. 5. replaceable battery. if it dies you can get another one you don't have to send it in to the company. dislikes: 1. the shuffle mode is annoying. it doesn't go through the entire playlist on shuffle. once a song is over it goes right back onto the potential playlist and can sometimes get played again fairly soon after it was first played to the exclusion of the other items on the list. i want to hear all my songs at least once before i hear repeats. 2. the creative media center software doesn't install on windows vista. 3. this is a hard drive player so no running with it. that's okay though for people like me: i don't run. it also makes it cheaper than the ipod nano which is a flash player. 4. the cable to recharge the battery is a usb cable that hooks directly into your computer. i don't like this because i'm not always around my computer i don't lug it with me everywhere i go. however there are ports you can buy (here on amazon even) that plug into the wall and have little usb ports so that's handy. 5. not as many accessories as the ipod but not that important. 6. you can't view your photos while you are listening to music. sometimes this sucks but if you have a camera phone or are in an actual conversation with someone you probably won't be listening to your music anyway.

" the very first dvd player i bought was sony's very first 5 disc dvd changer back in 1998. it was an excellent player but as the technology improved it could no longer keep up. i upgraded to a single disc sony which could handle dts and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video. but i always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. at about one-third the price of that original dvd changer this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. it produces an excellent picture has lots of tweakable settings has more outputs and is also very stylish looking. i do have a couple of nits though. my original dvd changer had buttons on the remote which allowed me to jump directly to whichever disc i wanted. with this one i have to press a disc skip button to cycle through all the discs until i reach the one i want. the front of the player does have direct access buttons though. i wish i still had my old remote control as i'm sure it would work with this unit to restore that remote functionality. second the upscaling through hdmi produces a great image but not really any better than leaving the image at 720x480p. in fact upscaling will sometimes magnify some interlacing artifacts visible in the picture. it's also unfortunate that while connected through hdmi progressive scan cannot be turned off. this shouldn't be an issue most of the time but there are some video sources that might look better with it turned off. progressive settings can only be changed on the unit itself and not through the remote but they cannot be turned off when connected through hdmi. one last thing about the hdmi connection. there can sometimes be a noticeable audio sync issue when using hdmi connections and digital tvs. this is not a problem with the player but with the way hdmi is currently implemented. this player has an audio-sync adjustment feature which should compensate for the problem. however the audio-sync adjustment doesn't work if the player is connected to a receiver via its optical digital outputs. since i need to have mine connected this way in order to enjoy 5.1 sound the audio-sync adjustment feature is useless here. and that's a shame. by the way there should be no audio-sync issues if the player is connected via component s-video or composite outputs. there's also a minor thing i've found about all my sony dvd players that i haven't liked. they are unable to correctly display time remaining on certain discs or more commonly on the special features (documentaries etc.) on certain discs. i also have a cheapo philips player which has no problems displaying time remaining on those things (even on the menu). it's an improvement i'd really like to see implemented on future players. now despite the complaints i've listed above don't get me wrong. this is still an excellent player and i really love it. i happily recommend it to anyone considering purchasing it. it really is a great value and it performs very well in most instances and i feel it's the best dvd player i've ever owned. it's just not quite perfect. in all likelihood it's also the last dvd player i'll ever own as i'll probably be buying a bluray or other hd player in a couple of years when that format war is over. but this is a great player to hold me over until then ",positive
" these headphones sound pretty good but they aren't the best. when running the volume controller gets in the way and bounces. it is also easy to change the volume which is annoying. i also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange. i realize it is done intentionally but it does nothing for me. overall for just listening at your desk or in your room these are great headphones. for running i would recommend something else ",positive

" radio reception in my apartment is terrible. i have purchased a few indoor antennas even a different terk model but none of them helped very much. i had to move the antenna around to different areas for different stations and my digital fm radio only received one digital channel. this unit however works great. i get every station i want and the digital fm works great. the only thing i would mention is that the antenna casing is bulky so if you're concerned about asthetics you'll have to figure out where you can conceal it. also i didn't get any additional benefit from the amplifier but the antenna worked so well that i didn't need it ",positive

" remember back in the day when cds first came out? i do: hi-fi shops and all my male relatives proudly did these demonstrations of scatching a cd putting it into a player play & *presto* the disc played. well either they were making bomb-proof players back thens or the laser never got to the scratched bit of the disc because i used to have piles of discs were handled carelessly and didn't play. yes you read correctly: i used to have stacks of unplayable discs. if you don't read any further you can stop at the end of this sentence: skip dr works! here's the short of it 1. i have my own multination consulting firm 2. i have worked with computer in the media and creative industries for over 20 years 3. i dislike misleading reviews 4. i dislike wasting my time looking for products that work 5. i dislike being lied to & wasting my money and 6. i dislike people aggressively selling me stuff that they have little knowledge about & frankly doesn't work on top of that i am impressed neither by people that trash products that do work nor people that work for certain manufacturers create ghost profiles and trump up their employer's products. skip doctors works. i own over 3500 discs. out of that number i had countless discs -- from my beloved trance planet disc a jessye norman classical and spirituals collection stuff by miles davis reams of and nina simone compilations to computer program discs backups of various creative projects rare sacds (superaudio cds) and stuff that got mangled at parties or being dragged around the world before creativelabs and ipod came on the scene -- that were all unreadable. i have seen the sprays i have seen the wipes i have seen the low grade sandpaper product i have tried using brasso metal polish (a remedy recommended by a friend of mine from venezuela -- and for little scratches actually works) and low-grade industrial solvent. hands down short of the industrial strength polishing machines (that handle 500 plus discs at a time and go from $1500 to over $5000) skip dr (and all its incarnations game dr / dvd dr / photo dr) works. period. why did i only rate the product '4 stars'? simple: this review is about the mechanical version of the product. and i am lazy: mechanised means effort. will i buy the mechanised version? definitely! the product is in my shopping basket will be ordered (when i finish writing this review to set the record straight!

" according to other reviews this radio compares favorably with others in its price class. as a ham radio operator i can say i am very happy with the e5. it is the best portable broadcast band radio i have ever had. it is the best portable shortwave radio i have ever had. i was particularly interested in ssb capability. it works well. i called about the noisy power supply and they are sending me the improved replacement. i use 2100 mah nimh batteries which i charge externally. i have two sets. the radio works well with these. i found that the internal antenna by itself indoors is not enough. i used the included wire antenna with moderately good results. but more convient is using the telescoping antenna. this antenna works according to the manual for fm and sw only but i found that extending it fully is effective in all cases. ressults using this method were similar to the wire. holding the radio and using the headset may also improve reception. hams know that the antenna is a critical part of any receiver. there are limits to what is possible in a package this size. i have not tested it with a tuned outdoor antenna. for what it is this is a great tool. it is a convient size and easy to program and use. it more than meets my expectations.

" i bought these for my dvd player. they work wonderfully! the old analog cables that came with the dvd player looked alright but [didn't measure up}. these monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies especially the dialogue. the old cables that i had made my movies sound a bit muffled. but the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever. for those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound i would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or cds ",positive
" the belkin tunetalk is fabuous for using an ipod as a digital recorder. i have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (sony ecm-ms908c stereo mic) attached. since i already had the mic the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. i haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. i suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a mackie 1202 or better. i bought a usb power adaptor so i wouldn't have to worry about battery drain. it plugs into the tunetalk and provides power to the ipod. no it isn't as good as a high dollar recorder dedicated mic-pre's and a pair of neumann mics. serious recording requires serious equipment. however for all those other recordings the tunetalk stereo is a great recording option for about $60 and your trusty ipod.

" this is my second projector - i used an nec for the last four years but that died on me recently. and boy am i glad it died - i am amazed by the quality of the ax100u - the pictures and colors almost jump off the screen at you. also the oft mentioned ldc projector 'screen door' effect is virtually non-existant - you have to stand almost next to the screen to notice it. i believe panny used some smoothening technology to achieve it. the contrast is also truely outstanding for an lcd projector - at par with dlp systesm but without the headaches of the rainbow effect. couple of pointers which might be helpful to other users. when i first started using the projector with my dvd player i was getting some wavy curls (not too visible but still there) that seemed to flow across the screeen. however after about 4-5 hours of use they have disappeared - so if any of you see those wavy curls just give it a few hours and hopefully yours will disappear as well. secondly unlike my old nec i was getting a flickering shimmer when using my hd box from my cable company. the shimmer was just at the edge of teh picture. there is an easy fix for this. go to options overscan and you can actually crop the edge of the image and not see it any more...voila - no flickers and an incredible picture. be aware that this is big bulky projector compared to some others out there. definately not a portable one - you don't want to be lugging it home from work after presentations to see home pictures. this was designed as a dedicated home theater projector not a portable presentation device. i highly recommend this projector - you've got to see the picture to believe it - i didn't think it was possible at this price range.

" i was very surprised at how well this sub articulates the low frequencies. hearing is believing. it gives a certain amount of accuracy and tangibility to base tones that i simply was not able to obtain with a higher priced sub i had purchased. for movies it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy. it really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market. i am not certain it can go as low as 27hz since i have not measured but i am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls. i just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system i could. i was able to do so with the addition of this sub. i am glad i found and tried it before paying much more for another sub i was considering. yet i hate the fact that it is advertised as being a 250-watt sub. its peak dynamic power is 250 watts. but the amplifier it contains is a 150 watt amplifier. therefore it is a 150-watt sub ",positive

" i have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything i hoped for. when i first opened the box it was shipped in i was very put off. there was a very very strong chemical smell. i chalked it up to something in the packaging material. it turns out that was not where the smell was coming from. it was the mouse pad itself. having worked in a shoe factory years ago i was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue. the smell hung around for a couple of days. now 1 week after having received my purchase if i put my nose close to the pad it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue. i would caution those with allergies and/or asthma to consider this prior to purchase. as an asthmatic i can say it did affect my breathing some what. that seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened. i have finished with my public health warning. on to the mouse pad. it is simply the best mouse pad i have ever used. i have had wrist problems for over 4 years now. i have had swelling and pain from my right pinkie finger to my elbow as a result of console gaming and lots of keyboarding work. in the past week my swelling has greatly reduced. my pain is almost gone. my wrist sits perfectly on the wrist rest. the pad actually cradles my wrist. the wrist rest moves with my hand so well and with so much support it seems to be an extension of my body. a new improved appendage. i have found myself resting my wrist on the pad even while not computing but just sitting at my desk. it truly is that comfortable. i already have plans to purchase two more for friends as christmas gifts. worth every cent! go for it! you will not be disappointed!

" so this controller looked pretty sweet to me so i bought it over a rumble pad. i liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat as i tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers. i bought this controller specifically for star wars battlefront 2 on pc and it works like a dream. i also like the x-box controller layout (offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic) than the ps2 style controller that is the logitech rumble pad. it also has better grips than a ps2 controller. the only things i think are bad about it are the following: 1. it is not modeled on the large xbox controller but rather the regular one which is ok for most people but i have big hands and i get a bit cramped up if i play for way too long. 2. i was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad. i have a saitek cyborg evo joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game. this isn't an issue with battlefront 2 since it has a very excellent in game control configurator but i could see where if a game didn't have as good an interface (or maybe older games) this pad could suffer in this regard. 3. this isn't so much an issue for me but i would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out. i don't care too much because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything. i will still use it even if it does die. overall a great controller i actually would give it a 4.5 rating but that isn't an option here ",positive

" maybe i'm bias because i really like yamaha maybe because i have kinda' good ears or it's the fat check sitting on my table from yamaha; but what ever it is i realllllllly like this sub-woofer. i looked around a long time for the right sub and i like to think i got a good one here. you want power? ok it's only 250 watts -not 1000 watts like velodyne but in my room (30 by 18ish with a 25 foot ceiling) it rocks. i love music all kinds; loud or quiet no matter i like both but i do like depth more than volume. however i believe if you are going to listen to something real loud being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it. and let me say you can feel music if you want to. one of the things i love most about this sub is it's range; it can (maybe) reach 20 hertz. 20 hertz! that is astounding. 20hz is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear in fact it's starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard. maybe i have good ears and maybe i don't but to hear rich airy low-end and bass notes. yes! bass notes! bass is not one big boomy lump of noise it's huge open grazing pasture of distinct sounds! in short music sounds great even hip-hop (which i don't like) sounds well better. also their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement; at very quiet levels too you can hear good clean bass notes. but if you do a lot of quite listening we're talking back ground music levels: disable the auto-on feature and manually turn it on and off because if you happen to be listening to something quiet even if you still can here low notes from this it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto-on well... on. it improves movies as well take something with a lot of dynamics like the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy or sky captain and the world of tomorrow there are a lot of sudden loud and very low sounds in those movie's and the yamaha handles it all with aplomb. with most of the controls are on the front set-up is and tweaking is made easy and if you are wondering about the bass button: if the button is in the music position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the movie position (i think music is a flatter frequency response). as this review seems to be getting a bit long i'll some it up: yes there are far better subwoofers out there (like from b&w) but i don't have the money for those and if someone gave me a 1000 watt velodyne i would take it in a heartbeat- but i wouldn't want to give this one up too. it's a absolute pleasure to listen to. update: i have run some test tones on this subwoofer and well it can not reach 20hz. 38hz seems to be the limit for usable bass although it is still audible to around 32hz 20hz is a stretch. if 38hz sounds to high: their are not many movie's or cd's that have any sounds below 35hz. and very very few have sound below 25hz. although it does not go as low as i would have hoped it is still a good sub for the money and still worth a five star review ",positive

" the card is blistering fast. i just wish it didn't take a performance hit in vista. it also has several other odd issues that i've become accustomed to when buying bleeding edge technology. (e.g. the official drivers released in february 2007 are missing several features in windows vista. like good tv-out support hibernation support proper ntune support. the march 2007 released vista beta drivers seems to cause a lot of people to have video driver crashes during games. check nvidia's message board for more info.) once nvidia straightens out their vista drivers issues this card will be golden. as it is the latest beta drivers did improve performance... but it introduced some stability issues. also evga's 90-day step-up program will hopefully allow me to jump into the 8900 series that is rumored to be released late-april 2007. lastly... it puts off an odd digital whine in 3d games and when resizing windows. i returned one (with green circuitboard) and got a new one form amazon (black circuitboard) and it did the same thing. amazon reimbursed me the return shipping! the digital whine isn't too bad but its fairly annoying if you have your game sound really low. i play with headphones so i don't really care ",positive

" in general lexar's usb drive does its job just as well as other usb drives; there isn't much of a difference except for the following: 1) portability good: it has a convenient way of attaching to your keychain bad: this rubber holder only lasts for so long (in my case 6-8 months) 2) it is extremely durable. this drive survived a full 30 minute (clothes) washer cycle. when i took it out of the washer i thought all the data and the drive was gone for good. to my surprise (after letting it dry for a day) it worked just fine. this is amazing! i have also accidentally stepped on it while wearing shoes (not using all of my weight though) a few times on carpet and concrete; and still works fine. finally i have dropped this drive on a variety of surfaces and it's still fine. 3) looks: good: it is very easy to see since it is bright red bad: it is fatter than other usb drives and it is bright red. the drive is pretty ugly. it maybe good to note however that the drive's structure is probably a good reason as to why it has survived my abuse. the bright red color's advantage has already been mentioned above ",positive

" i'm a college kid recreational audiophile and bass fanatic studying engineering. i started off building a custom sub encloser with dual kicker compvr 12 subs driven by a 1200w sony amp. i haven't stopped searching for great sound since. i'm running a pair of these off an h/k avr240 combined with a jbl ec35 center a jbl s120pii 400w sub and two sets of e30 surrounds. i'm big on trying anything before i buy it. i was able to listen to these and the e80s (the dual 6 floorstandings) at a local audio store before they were discontinued. i loved the sound of these and the polk and klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics. with the jbls at a fraction of the price here on amazon it was no question. the only issue was what model to get... i heard very little difference in qualtiy between the e60s and e80s. the dual 6 put out a bit lower frequencies but the difference was so small that i wouldn't be able to notice without the speakers side by side. living in a small college apartment the e90s and e100s were beautiful but a bit overkill for what i needed. i deceided on these over the e60s with the hopes that a single 8 would draw less from my amp than the dual 6 for a bit less money. beautiful home theater and music speaker... crisp highs defined mids and respectable bass. they are a bit top heavy as any tower will be. and i love extremely low loud bass and as such i suplemented the system with a sweet jbl sub. movies sound great: saving private ryan fifth element 40 year old virgin anchorman etc... etc... music is also fantastic (with different amp settings tuned for genre): ambient electronica hip-hop rap jazz 80s classical rock. ulrich schnauss bonobo dj shadow busta snoop e40 louis armstrong michael jackson bach korn metallica hoobastank 311. if you're looking for a quality tower speaker... this is it. bass fanatics look at the s120pii. you won't regret it. ~shakas~ ",positive

" i have owned this backpack for almost two years and have put thousands of miles on it in nyc (my home town) and traveling on business across the us. a place for everything and everything in its place. first this thing has 3 major compartments and a 4th 'open' compartment; a padded laptop compartment large enough for a mac 17 with enough room left over of books or magazines. the second compartment has an internal file folder compression panel that keeps your paperwork flat orderly and compressed against your body(if you ever had the paper clip come off of a 40 page document in your backpack you know how great this feature is). the final main compartment contains an integrated open-top mesh bag for your power brick and other miscellaneous computer gear. again this has been designed to keep the weight compressed and close to your body. each compartment has plenty of extra room beyond its required purpose. the forth 'open' compartment is stiff outer panel with a compression draw strings around the sides in which you can stuff: your book newspaper umbrella rain jacket lunch magazine camera ipod or anything you need to securely stash away and retrieve at a moments notice while on the go. a great feature! finally this rig is fitted out with no less than 5 additional zippered pockets and 4 pockets-inside-of-pockets and: a separate gear bag as well as a cd-rom sleeve and a removable cell phone pocket on the shoulder strap. the styling is professional enough of serious meetings. you can also carry the bag to the side with its well padded handle. this is key in elevators and subways. all and all you can load this down for a 3 day road trip and it still feels solid and balanced on your back. final notes: - zippers are high quality with big rubber grips - the black & grey color scheme will not show dirt and wear. - fits snug under airline seats - good padding on shoulders and back panel. - did i mention all the pockets? any down side? having this bag becomes an exercise in self control for pack-rats. when full this bag is big. but if you don't mind looking looking geeky and knocking people over when you turn around fill it up and your good to go. other wise just limit your stuff.

" i've used the sd-yd250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear. overall the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor-saving convenience. i've used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough. it can also save a lot of money provided you purchase the yeast in bulk (for example 2lb). the single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at american supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram. particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough. this takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza and when the dough is refrigerated for later use it tastes even better in my opinion. like most engineered products of our age this one is full of cute features that add little value or cause annoyance. the yeast dispenser makes a marginal difference at best. if you use it you (for the most part) create extra work for yourself because you'll have to clean it later. the dozens of different bake modes make the product more complicated to use. they make a marginal difference in baking results. i only use the quick bake mode which takes 2 hours to complete. let's say you make a mistake and start the unit using the wrong settings (easy to do given the many parameters you can set). you just push the reset or cancel button and start over right? nope no such button exists. then unplug the unit and plug it back in right? nope the engineers decided it would be a cute feature to protect against power outages so the unit remembers where it left off. yes but the instruction manual states that you can wait 10 minutes and after 10 minutes it will forget right? nope i tried this too. the unit does indeed forget eventually but it's more than 11 minutes. if you plug it back too early the timer resets and you have to wait again. to summarize the hardware is excellent and the software that controls it could hardly be dumber ",positive

" my 2 year old saw this in bjs and kept asking for it so santa brought it for him for christmas. i think it's a good first guitar. he loves to strum it but he definitely needs to be supervised to teach him to respect that it is a special musical instrument not a toy. so far he has sat on it and used it as a drum and it's held up fine but i don't think it would hold up with such continued abuse. it is recommended for children much older than he is so i can't expect anything different. i do wish they made a smaller version of it so it would be more comfortable for him. for a better price than i see at amazon you can get a small hohner guitar at a music store which might be better quality i'm not sure. regardless i am very happy with this guitar and i would recommend it for any child who shows a real interest in music. i would not buy it for a child just as a toy unless you don't mind it being destroyed. i am planning to buy the guitar strap and will review that when i get it ",positive

" this eton radio is the u.s. domestic version of the chinese tecsun pl-550 all-band pocket sized radio. the chinese version is legended in the native language and utilitarian in appearance and less expensive. the eton is well in english with slight curves. i have used and tested other tecsun produced radios including the pl-200 (eton 10) and the grundig etraveller vii. this radio like the other tecsun models has excellent frequency discrimination as well as the ability to directly enter the frequency desired (if you know it) or scan through the am fm and many shortwave bands find the stations you like and store their frequencies. closely allied for example fm stations within 200 khz (only the strongest will be heard on most commercial fm receivers) of each other can be picked up with clarity positioning the manuverable whip antenna. very very few radios excepting expensive car radios can boast such performance in the unites states. now on the market are other comparable radios all made by tecsun in china using the very same sophisicated reception circuitry regelated previously to expensive shortwave receivers. this model has other features as well: two preset wake-up times for programs from preselected stations scanning of all bands for stations and an antenna trimmer which permits optimizing reception on weakly received broadcasts some 500 station memories and special reception selectivity for shortwave stations whose frequencies are almost overlapping. for the price this radio is simply an excellent value but people wishing to receive shortwave broadcasts are warned: shortwave reception from this radio and every other shortwave radio for that matter of stations other than the powerful broadcasters benefits enormously from the use of an external long wire antenna. tecsun does provide a retractable wire antenna with the radio. alas as with almost all radios this size there is no single side band (ssb) reception an enhancement that defying digital technology actually requires listener intervention to optimize and has great potential but has for the present at least been consigned to the province of the technical listener more interested in ascertaining distant reception than actual broadcast information. the dalai lama for all his 5000 watts ssb from tibet can not be heard on this radio. china radio shortwave at 150000 watts conventiona am shortwave with canadian relay stations does just fine. australian radio at the same power radio havana radio serbia croatia russia netherlands sweden india israel etc. at lesser power and some with and most without relay stations are also heard clearly on the eastern seaboard during their times of broadcast - usually in the early evening est ",positive
" i've had my e-10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it's performance. my interests in radio pretty much revolve around a.m.(or medium wave) dx'ing and shortwave listening. it's performance on a.m. is on a par with the highly regarded kaito ka-1103 which i received for christmas this year. shortwave performance is very close however the kaito is superior in this area (and features ssb tuning as well)f.m.? the e-10 is well above average but falls short of the kaito ka-1103. i've yet to see a radio that can equal the kaitos performance in this area but the e-10 is closer than most.build qualityergonomicsand appearance are second to none and better than most. the slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a top of the line portable multi band receiver even though it's moderately priced.it's lcd digital display is one of the largest and nicest i've seenvery easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight. other amenities such as 500 plus memories12/24 hour clocki.f. shift and antennae trim which are both useful in shortwave receptionlocal/dx switch and the internal battery charger for nicad or nimh batteries all add up to make this a radio i'm glad i purchased and often recommend to those needing a radio of this type.even the accessories included with this radio such as the carrying satchelearbudsand reel-up shortwave antennae are top notch! now if you're wondering why after all this praise i only gave it a four star ratingand not a five it's because eton did not provide ssb tuning capability on this receiver. and it's a shame because it's shortwave performance is good enough to utilize it. in my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio. hence they only hit a triple(which is way more exciting nonetheless i'm a baseball nut too) and not a home run ",positive

" i just received these and popped 'em in and i'm listening to mp3s on my pc. at first one of sides was really weak in volume. in the process of testing the balance in my software i accidentally cranked up the volume way to high for these guys but that apparently did the trick. now both are equal and sound good. there is decent bass but the highs are a bit soft. a quick tweak to my equalizer and they're great. after reading several of the reviews on amazon i was a bit worried about the sound but now that i have them i'm very happy. they're a good price and sooooo much better than the little ipod-like earbuds i've tried before. those never stayed in my ear and the bass never made me happy. summary: these jbuds stay in my ear have good sound (not great but i think good for $20) and have equal length cords from each ear ",positive
" i have just started with an apple ipod nano product and was not impressed with the factory included ear buds at all. they didn't sound real good and didn't come supplied with the ear bud pads in the box so they would just fall out of your ears. what's the deal with that? next came the old sony mdr 027 head phones from the closet. the sony's have the old adjustable head bar so no more falling out of the ears now. they worked o.k. i guess but in comparison these jbuds sound much better than either of the previous ones. i'm now listening at half volume compared to about three quarters before and all sounds fine. i'm hearing parts of the music not audible before with the other two models. crisper highs great mid range and responsive lows. set up was fast too just find the correct size ear bud pads out of the three different sized pairs supplied and your off and running. the jbuds actually stay in your ear. wow what a concept. they are also very comfortable due to the fact i forgot they were in and started talking on the phone before noticing. the cord is just the right length for setting the ipod on a desk while still allowing plenty of movement or attaching it to a pocket. if you think you have a little too much just wrap some up with a bread tie. better too much than not enough. so back to the closet with the sony. i guess what it all boils down to is you could do a whole lot worse than these especially for a mere twenty bucks. i couldn't have made a better choice for the money and quality. you should do the same. another quick note. the shipping went great. not too long at all and with standard usps. thanks amazon ",positive

" i made the mistake to buy the kensington laser pointer before this one. the kensington is a good one very well made but it is slightly more expensive and lacks the mouse control. i to not know any cheaper model with mouse function. i can maybe prefer a bit the ergonomy of the kensington together with the very practical possibility to store the usb receiver inside the unit but this is probably just my taste and the hiro is quite comfortable either and lighter. my kensington has the embarrassing feature that the laser pointer is interpreted as return on some applications (exporer on windows and opera on mac os for instance). i do not know it that is a bug or if there is some reason for that. however the hiro does not have this behaviour and that is another reason for which i prefer it. the wheel system of the hiro presenter is very practical. compared with my kensington i found no difference in the quality of the laser: both do their job perfectly. the mouse control is simple and practlical and it will take a very short time to be confident with it. my unit worked perfectly wothout extra software on both mac an pc. overall i am extremely satisfied. on the minus side the labels on the button on the side are printed with very poor colours. the fn label diapperared immediately after a few days of usage. a bit disappointing but after all nothing really important. the unit also lacks programmable buttons but i do not know any presenter with this feature. bottomline. this presenter works well it is not expensive and the mouse control is a true must ",positive

" i bought this mouse about three months ago and i love it. it works on every surface and the scroller works well too. the only complaint i have is that the cord is rather short (about 2.5 feet long) and it plugs into the left-hand side of my laptop which means that i only have about a foot to work with. although i think that complaint can be shared equally with the dell people for putting the usb port on the left (good deal for the left-handed population i guess). some people have complained about the wind-up function for the cord getting tangled but i haven't had any problems with that ",positive

" with all the reviews about how easy the nano scratches i left the protective film on until i found the right case the next day at cc (they had just received them that day) sorry amazon but the nano did come from you. anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the nano itself. it comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself. i have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible it works great. it fits snugly in this case yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update. the case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls. i have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all. the belt clip is sturdy and secure. the magnetic snap for closing it works great. the case can be closed with headphones attached but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access. this case is as cool as the nano itself and i would very highly recommend it. i hope belkin makes the same case for the new ipod ",positive

" this was my first gps system of any kind. i wasn't sure what to expect. i have a small mazda miata so i wanted a small-screen gps that did not overwhelm my small dashboard and this did not disappoint. i was afraid that the screen would be too small but it's perfect. i don't think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space. i live in new york city and before putting it in my car i walked with the gps unit in my hands. perhaps because of the tall buildings and the slow walking speed it took more than 30 minutes for it to initially receive a satellite signal. i was convinced it was defective. it's not. once i put it on the dash of my car and began driving it acquired a satellite signal within a few minutes. this unit comes with a 128mb micro sdcard onto which you can load a few state maps at one time. i ordered a 1gb micro sdcard along with this gps (for approx. $11 on amazon) and loaded all of north america at one time. this eliminates the need to re-load maps when traveling anywhere in the country. it's worth the extra effort. this unit can be quickly moved from one car to another especially a rental car anywhere in north america. my very first test of this thing was on the very complicated underpasses and overpasses in northern manhattan and the bronx. it was flawless! it's impossible to get lost with this thing. occasionally i've made a turn too early or too late and within seconds it will re-calculate the best route. the combination of the voice prompts the highlighted route you need to go and the current and next street(s) at the top are excellent. also the estimated arrival time in the lower left is nice but does not account for traffic jams. the arrival time will just keep getting pushed back the slower you travel. it's kind of a best traffic scenario prediction. this is so easy to use i'm thinking of buying one for my 68-year-old mother who doesn't have a clue when it comes to technology but i'm convinced she could use this without a problem (once i've loaded the maps for her.) if not having bluetooth and all the other latest bells and whistles on a gps system doesn't bother you (as it doesn't bother me) buy this you won't be sorry!

" the eyetv 2.x software is a bit rough around the edges (compared to dish dvr and tivo) but it's very usable and works great. i bought this so i can watch the maryland terrapins at work (cbs mmod blacks out local games) and it's great to be able to infinitely adjust the video window. you can record the program and watch it at lunch or when you get a chance. you will need a good antenna and i wish they provided one like miglia. but guess what you can buy the miglia magnetic antenna and it works better than many larger antennas from radio shack or target. the miglia antenna comes apart and can go with you on travel. imagine watching local hdtv on the road without having to use the hotel cable.

" i got mine for about 1 week ago to match with my mbp (silver theme). someone mentioned about the light indications not showing as they should or in the wrong way but mine works fine. cons: - light indicator shows exactly which usb ports are in use. - small in size - has usb port on top which comes in handy. - enough usb power- so far i didn't have to plug in the power charger yet. - comes with a usb plugged light. - comes with a extended usb cable (for you to connect the hub to your computer) - the usb plug is silver + transparent in color which looks kinda nice. prons: - it camed with some minor scratches on the hub's surface although i just took it out from its sealed package carefully. those surface scratches aren't too noticeable. (didn't want to return it and waste time & money). - as many have already mentioned the usb cable is connected to the hub permanently. other thoughts: - the usb cable connected the the hub is pretty thin. it'd be a good feature (look less noticeable) f you treat the cable nicely but if you are harsh on the cable it feels like it may break. will be great if this hub has firewire ports but i'm very happy with this item ",positive
" i've owned this pocket pc for a week now with very little problems. i don't know anything about an upgrade but so far i haven't had any major problems with it. when i left it in the car and then came home it wouldn't turn on. i noticed it was very warm but as soon as i did a soft reset the device turned on. the soft reset doesn't make you lose all your data. i just had to reset the date. i've had to do this a couple of times so far. i did purchase a 2 gig sd card and have lots of room. i recommend that you shop around for the 2 gig memory card however because i bought mine from amazon and then i found it cheaper at best buy. i am really happy with this product. i love the way it looks. it's easy to figure out and i'm not really savvy with electronic gadgets. i did sign up for hotmail so i could use the msn features. it was easy to sync my music to the device and the download is done automatically with the sync. the music sounds great with a great pair of headphones. i use the calendar which helps to remind of events and appointments. also use the task button which reminds of stuff that needs to be done. great for the highly stressed out who tend to forget things. there is also a feature to write a note in your own handwriting and then the device turns it into typewritten words. really neat! i use the recording device to record my class lecture and it's a little hard to hear but there is a lot of noise in the classroom and i sit in the back and the teacher is up at the front. but the important thing is that i could understand what was being said so i could transcribe it. as a nursing student i was able to purchase and download nursing programs from a website with no problems and they run great. i just can't believe all the features that come with this pocket pc. i have no regrets making this purchase. i look forward to reading more reviews on this product and learning everything it can do. so far it's been fun ",positive

" it's a good phone works well. i like the caller id & function buttons being a different color than from the rest of the phone makes them easier to see & use. it has good sound & a ring tone that doesn't jangle the nerves. the only problem i had with it is that the cord goes directly into the phone & one must use the cord that the phone comes with rather than one already in use. i purchased an adapter so that i could plug it into an extension phone cord because we needed to put it some distance from the wall jack. not a big deal in my book but one i didn't learn about until i got the phone. overall i am pleased with it ",positive
" while these recorders are considered old fashioned by electronic geeks they are very useful for those of us who just want to use the counters and go to specific areas of a tape. mine paid for itself in the first 5 minutes of a legal deposition when i jogged the momory of a forgetful witness with his own words on tape. he still insisted he couldn't remember anything but had to admit it was his voice and that he -- being the model of honesty and truth -- must have been trying to tell the truth when he spoke. very effective these old-fashioned recorders.

" after 8 months of thinking these (foam inserts that came with my e3c's)will last forever i broke down and ordered these replacements as the originals were getting quite dirty. whoa! the new ones made me realize how much my originals had hardened. my great sound and comfort was back - and the decay was so gradual i didn't even realize what i was missing! so 5 stars for performance but 3 stars for what amounts to some pretty expensive foam ear plugs. avg=4stars ",positive

" opened the enclosure plugged in my hard drive connected it to my pc and it worked. simple as that. i spent a whole 10 seconds realizing that the instructions provided showed that i had to remove a single screw from the back panel when i really had to remove two screws but that was the only (very minor) problem. there is no fan in the case which means the only noise is from the hard drive itself. i am assuming the case itself acts as a large heatsink but i havent yet monitered temperatures on the hard drive itself. i am pleased with the enclosure and would happily recomend it to anyone ",positive
" we bought this to use with our ws-300m to record a class. we thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording. in the end we set the recorder to mono (hq) because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other! good quality but distracting. save your money and buy the mono mic. the quality is excellent in either setting. buy the way in case you miss it this mic does come with a cable to connect it to the recorder ",positive
" i purchased this gps back in april of 2006 and have been very happy with it since. it is not perfect but you have to remember that this is not a dedicated street navigator or hicker gps it's a hybrid of the two and with that there are compromises. in the car: it is accurate and maps routes quickly 90% of the time. the other 10% of the time it either looses signal has outdated maps (my update is ordered and on it's way as i type) or just slow processing for some reason. of this 10% of the time i'd say only 2% of the time has this been an actual problem for me. the rest of the time i was able to simply guess what i needed to do next or it didn't matter at all. i have not found a perfect way of fixing the slow route calcuations but the vast majority of the time this hasn't been an issue. on foot: one of the features that sold me on this was the fact that it had a long lasting battery and it was waterproof. both qualities needed to be used for hiking. the only catch is you have to turn off the lock to roads otherwise you will get some really confusing directions! also it is difficult to program in destinations by coordinates as opposed to addresses but it can be done (put in and address then change everything including the coordinates in the confirmation screen before hitting route!). on boat: haven't tested this as i don't have a boat and haven't purchased the water based maps. overall i'm very happy with this and looking forward to the map update. i wish it was a little faster on route calculating and map drawing and that it was easier to imput exact coordinate points. it's still better than buying/lugging around 2 seperate gps systems to me ",positive

" i own one in each color for my multiple pair of earbuds. i have to say that the only way to improve upon this product other than offering more color combinations would be to make it bulletproof which it damn near is already. a wonderfully convenient and stylish accessory. although $15 might come across as steep for such a small product the cost becomes easier to justify as you begin purchasing more expensive earbuds. the $100+ shure earphones are a sizable investment and must be protected. the sendstation earbuddy meets that demand better than any other product in it's category ",positive

" i have owned this for about a week and wanted to share some initial thoughts. all in all pretty pleased with the purchase. it was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my ipod mini. there are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models. panicked at first because they didn't have one for the mini but it was already installed on the model. cons: - light dimmer has three settings but even the lowest is too bright. you can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote. - no ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week. for example 7:00am monday to friday no alarm on weekends. - wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset (by you) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle. - sound is great for an alarm clock. don't think it will compare with a mini stereo or bose sounddock. would buy again at the price ",positive
" the first ipod clock radio i bought was an emerson itone that was very disappointing. after returning it i did a bunch of research and decided to order the i177 (white). i am very happy with the unit. the sound is great. while it is not a bose it sounds way better than your average alarm clock. the controls are very intuitive and simple to use. i have a 4th generation ipod and it fit perfectly. another great feature is the display dimmer. you can turn the backlight completely off a feature not found in many other products. a common complaint i read about for other brands of radio was that the display would light up the room! not a problem with this unit. the remote control is pretty neat too. i like the fact that i can control my ipod remotely. there are 2 separate alarms which is nice if your significant other has to get up at a different time. the only lacking feature is the ability to store radio stations. this would be nice but i bought this unit to wake to my ipod so i can't complain. overall this thing is great.

" since there is now relatively few choices for a good corded phone (esp. with caller id) this phone is tops. this phone and all other at&t phones corded or cordless exhibit slight feedback when talking loud or when hanging up. but no other phone out there seems to be nearly as durable. given the other choices this is the one to get ",positive
" i bought this device to mount on the wall in front of my work desk and for that purpose it's an admirable phone. plus: the contrast- adjustable lcd displays current date and time without you having to set it the buttons for call list browsing option setting etc. are on the back of the receiver so you don't have to take the phone off the hook to use them. the sound quality is great of course this being a corded phone and it feels somewhat worthy in your hand. the keypad lights up although only for a few seconds - dial fast in the dark! the ring tone is nice at its medium setting. minus: i find the base a bit bulky the lcd has no background light and when the handset is set to hi volume you do hear a bit of a screeching noise when putting the set down on the base (i keep the setting at lo though which is plenty loud). my main gripe is that the phone doesn't have a voicemail indicator which would be extremely sweet with my phone company (vonage). also the caller id stuff works with batteries only - at least they could have put a 6v ac adapter plug on the phone. still four stars because the phone does all it says it does ",positive
" i checked previous reviews before purchasing this notebook case. what i received is what i expected. lots of compartments to store needed accessories sturdy construction pleasant appearance. as with a previous review my only citicism is the shoulder strap. while it is comfortable when used it is also fixed and cannot be removed. i've already caught it once on an airline seat arm when boarding a crowded plane. other than that it was a good purchase for the price ",positive
" this monitor is an awesome buy. i had no problems with my monitor dead pixel-wise. the only complaints i have to add are those that others have already voiced. the stand does not securely fasten to the monitor it just sort of sits there... a good push and down she may go. the menu buttons on the right side aren't confusing to use my other monitors have used a similar setup: menu activates menu and also activates a menu item up/down change values menu backs out and there is a menu item to exit. if i had put two of these monitors side by side i can see how accessing the power button of the monitor on the left would be an issue minor but perhaps irksome. i have not tested the speakers but seriously a good set of speakers won't set you back much that's not what this monitor is for. i would definitely buy another one in a heartbeat if i didn't already have three monitors to begin with ",positive
" if only other computer products were this easy to set up and use - highly recommend this product ",positive
" makes plane flights so much more enjoyable and costs hundreds less than other brands. only thing that could make it better is passive noise reduction but then it would be bulkier ",positive

" they don't collapse so they aren't the most easily portable as you sure aren't putting them in your pocket. you also aren't listening to music in bed with them as mentioned in other reviews the back is not adjustable and will push the vertical facing speakers out of your ears. i tend to collect lower end headphones and why not. so i do have a unique perspective on them (or so i say mostly to flatter myself). these compared to other vertical designs are good. the sound is better than most. not quite as good as the sony h.ear line but those would never stay in my ears and when dangling they are literally tangle hooks. these p9's are simple one piece and very smartly the cord only comes up to one ear. the volume adjustment makes them nice for tv and computer use. also if you ever listen while using a splitter make sure the other person is wearing the cans (or whatever more power consumptiony headphones) so you can cut your volume. my wife wears cans when watching tv so when i just must watch some witty sonic commercial i just plug myself in. they aren't perfect. i'd like to also try the sennheiser vertical over the head cheapos as well as the sony folding ones. they did come in very handy when my scroll wheel on my rio carbon was broken (only volume control on the thing). for reference my everyday buds are sony ed21lps which i highly reccomend for all purpose use as they wont fall out and can be stored in a very small area. heck i even use the stupid pouch that comes with them. but yeah knowing the weaknesses of the p9 if you think you'd like it then you'll love it ",positive

" in spite of some of the poor reviews for this product it met all of my expectations 100%. thanks to the reviews i understood that the unit doesn't have a builtin antenna or batteries which was helpful to know in advance. but of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place. i was looking for a small tv to fit in the corner of my bathroom and this unit is perfect for that. as a bonus i can not only watch the news while i'm getting ready for work in the morning but i can listen to mp3 rips when i'm in the shower. i've owned the unit for several weeks now use it every day and have never had a problem playing any disk either copy-protected movies or cds. my only concern so far has been that i didn't receive a warrantee card with the unit. i especially like the portability. it's so easy to pick up and take anywhere such as watching a movie in bed and even outside (if it's not too bright out) for watching sports on the patio. the speakers are adequate considering their size and the headphone jack lets me either use headphones or external amplified speakers if i want better quality. in summary i have to repeat that my expectations were set before i bought the unit and i am very pleased with what i got for the price ",positive

" can't say enough good things about this brother all-in-one given its price and features. (i paid $100 more than the new amazon price elsewhere a week ago.) i installed as a network device and set up the software on my xp pro as well as mac os 10.4.9 machines ... easy installation and the interface on each os is essentially the same. super fast prints from either machine crisp and beautiful with tonal background fills printing which never showed up on my previous hp laser. duplex scan/fax as well as duplex print was the key to my purchase and i've been really happy. what i did not anticipate was just how fast the printer is or how rich the delivered software is compared with prior hp experience. noises don't seem unusual to me - no crackling here just noisy paper handling by adf and print engine. no big deal imho. only a few minor negatives i've seen so far: (1) it looks like the firmware can only be updated from a windows computer so mac folks are stuck there (mine was delivered with current version of firmware so maybe this doesn't matter) (2) you cannot feed heavy stock through it even the manual feed tray - so need to keep a straight feed device around if you need thicker than 24# stock (3) scanner transfer rate to computer is a bit slow - not sure if it is the network interface or a slow processor in the device and (4) expansion memory is not a popular size so is more expensive than current pc memory - not sure if i'll upgrade or not. haven't tried envelopes yet so can't respond to earlier comments from others. it's kind of entertaining to watch the machine do a duplex copy - as pages in the adf suck in and out to scan both sides and pages ejecting come partway out and suck back in to copy the back side ",positive

" compared to my logitech mouseman dual optical from 2000 this mouse blows it away by far in accuracy precision. what i find to be a drawback is the mouse's light weight and small size. the size comes in handy if i need to flick but be sure to keep the wire out of the way - as the mouse is so light if you have the wire in a bad spot it will push the mouse and affect your aim at crucial moments. the change sensitivity button is in a strange spot (at least if u have large hands) located in the center of the mouse where you will need to reach far back and almost touch the pad of your palm of the finger you're reaching with - not an efficient movement therefore not applicable in games (you can assign a sensitivity script to perhaps one of the side mouse buttons if necessary). these are only minor itches when compared to the outstanding precision and i would highly recommend it ",positive
" i did my research before purchasing this wireless card from amazon to use in conjunction with my belkin pre-n wireless router. according to every net review i'd read this combination of belkin pre-n desktop card and router had the best range and throughput at that range than any other card/router in its class and as my workstation is out in the middle of a farm an almost impossible distance from the router 'range' is what i needed above all. after some configuration and finding the best spot to put the computer itself i now regularly have connection qualities in the 77-90% range a good 200-300 ft. from my router which is in another building entirely (and both have a lot of metal cladding and what-not i had expected to cause a great deal of interference if not outright unworkability.) the odd thing about this 'pre-n' combination from belkin is that apparently the later belkin n equipment is grossly inferior and manages to pull off only about half the range of this model. these cards and the pre-n router are becoming harder to find as they've been superseded by the newer (inferior) models currently in the stores so if you have to operate wireless at great distances i doubt you'll beat these belkin models for at least the immediate future ",positive

" in my opinion sony's strength lies in its tvs. this line of lcd sets are expensive but you'll definitely get what you pay for. the picture quality is incredible! the beauty of this set is also material - it is a work of art. while the internal speakers are decent i would have been just as happy not to have them. but thanks to the beautiful design of the bezel you don't even know the speakers are there. some reviewers have mentioned lcd clouding and for a product of this price it would serve you well to do the appropriate google search. but sony stands by its products and if you receive a set that is not up to standards they will rectify the situation. also many reviewers are mentioning a lower-quality picture. it is important to understand what kind of signal you are feeding the tv and what signal will give you the optimal image. not all hd signals are the same and will provide you with varying degrees of quality. be prepared to upgrade other equipment to explore the maximum potential of this device. but i have yet to see a signal that wasn't enhanced by being viewed on this set over my previous panasonic tube set. the interchangable bezels is a nice idea but only for those with deep(er) pockets. the silver set alone is beautiful and if i had only one complaint it would be that it's harder to get matching sony peripherals in silver than you might think. all in all it's the best lcd you can buy ",positive
" as the ps2 does not have hdmi outputs for high-definition tv's the monster cable gamelink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more. you'd have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard (red white yellow) av cables picture clarity. they are in two different worlds and monster fully delivers. however your tv must have component (red blue green) inputs for this cable to be useful. ensure that you have a fiber optic digital cable for your sound to go from your ps2 to your compatible tv/receiver. these cables are for picture only and do not have a sound cable. therefore you'll have to forget using the single plug-in the ps2 offers for both audio and video. however your sound will be uncompressed fully digital audio. this is definitely a plus rather than a negative. any mid-priced television or receiver built in the last six years will have a digital audio input ",positive

" great gps unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that. clear easy to read display and instructions. menus and interface are self-intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it. no downloads activations or learning required. satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast. accuracy is impressive with spot-on instructions and updated maps. even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled. after looking at the garmin and magellan units i thought this was the best unit for the price. it has the largest screen and the most features for this price range. a previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of bluetooth capabilities to which i completely disagree. the fact the bluetooth features are available at this price range is already impressive. also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a dashboard stand. all manufacturers seem to sell them as options (garmin included).

" we bought this external drive after learning that our friends lost all but a couple months worth of photos and/or videos from their first year with adorable triplet daughters. it resulted from the dreaded and inevitable hard-drive crash that everyone fears but nobody thinks will happen to them. attempts by two data recovery firms were unsuccessful and now they're left with whatever printed photos they and their family and friends could find. expecting our first child in less than three weeks we don't want to find ourselves in the same predicament especially with years of other irreplaceable photos financial data and other documents on our laptop. now we're doing weekly monthly and annual backups and storing some of those offsite to protect against something even worse than a simple crash of a hard drive. even if we don't completely stick with this new regimen it's better than what we used to do -- which though thankfully uneventful was absolutely nothing. if that's not enough to make you want to buy this then the sony name quality reliability and ease of use should be. the drive is small stylish easily installed and takes up little space in the vertical position. although it's a little loud when the drive is working it reads and writes cd-r media up to 48x ultra speed plus cd-rw up to 32x dvd+/-r up to 16x and high speed dvd+rw up to 8x. after a lengthy initial full backup using the included nero backitup software (about 8 gb onto 10 old cd-r discs in 2.5-3.0 hours) smaller differential monthly backups and incremental weekly backups to 8x dvd+rw discs take between 10 and 20 minutes each when compressing copying and verifying everything. backup copies of our 4 gb wedding dvd onto 8x dvd-r discs took about 15-20 minutes. the nero software seems very extensive but i haven't used much of it so far. the interface is pretty intuitive and it's easy to find what you want to do but some of the more detailed or technical options might be overwhelming for someone who's new to this kind of software or doesn't want to spend a lot of time reading the pdf manual. the only real complaint i have is with the backitup program's job scheduler which only gives you daily weekly and yearly frequency options (you need to set up monthly backups as weekly jobs and either disable or skip them for several weeks in between months) it takes forever to re-scan files when building a new job on an existing one (setting up subsequent daily weekly or monthly jobs based on the initial full annual backup) and the data you can change for an existing job is limited (can't rename it or alter the content without creating a whole new job). overall great external dvd/cd drive for watching video listening to music and backing up data. good software that's intuitive and functional with some room for improvement but there's no real need for additional software you don't already have. excellent value -- bought it at amazon for under $160 with taxes and free shipping and got a $30 mail-in rebate from sony. also bought pack of 25 ritek 8x dvd+rw discs from thetechgeek.com for $33 delivered and they threw in a free 10-pack of velocity 8x dvd-r discs. so for well under $200 and a little effort you too can view hear copy and/or backup your valuable photos videos tunes and other data in no time ",positive

" i bought this enclosure about 1 year ago. i put a 200gb hard drive in it and use it as my dedicated itunes library. it was a super easy setup. many complain in the other reviews that it's a tight fit inside but i didn't find it difficult at all to get the hard drive in. after connecting the hard drive and closing it up i simply connected it via firewire to my mac g4 and it worked like a charm! next month i will have it for 1 year and i would be 100% happy with it if not for one thing... the loud fan noise after about 10 minutes of it being turned on! arghh!! all of a sudden it just starts sounding off with this annoying buzzing sound that gets slightly louder with time. every-so-often the buzzing goes away for about 1 to 2 minutes but it always returns with a vengence! otherwise the enclosure has held up and worked nicely for almost 1 year. i'm definitly going to get rid of it though once i find an enclosure that is equally aesthetically pleasing and as reliable but not nearly as noisy!!! it's a shame actually since i'm in the market to get 2 more enclosures to house my aperture library and data backup respectively ",positive

" this cable really cleaned up the display image. i had been running another monster cable - the 6 meter version. i needed the length before because of the way my system was configured. i have a review under that cable about how quality does matter. and so does length. at the time i wrote the review i was just ordering the cable and was posting what i had found out in researching digital video signals. everything in there stands true. i changed my setup and decided to invest in a shorter version of the cable - the 1 meter version - because i could now get away with a much shorter cable. i installed it this morning and the difference while not earth shattering was definitely visible. i use this cable to connect between the video card on a media pc and my tv (sony rear-projection lcd). the image used to swim a little along the edges of some windows text etc. and the image wasn't as clear as i had hoped. while the image looked good it didn't look great. that's why i decided to take the plunge and spend an extra $79 bucks. the difference is somethine like going from a regular rf feed to your tv and component video cables. now the image is crisp and clear and there is no swimming. it actually brings out detail i couldn't even see before - to the point of deciding to turn on fsaa and filtering so video games have a more realistic look. and that they do. i don't know how other brands compare to the monster cables as i haven't tried them. what i do know is that signal integrity is very important to a good looking display. you can get that with high quality cables and by keeping the length to the absolute minimum required as there was a very perceptible difference just between the 1 meter and 6 meter versions of the exact same thing. one more thing while i'm here. i want to thank amazon for going the extra mile on customer service. i had a dvd disappear somehow during shipping. ups said they delivered it but i never received it. i asked amazon if they filed the report with ups or i did to file a claim. what i got was a reply telling me a replacement was already on its way. that is service. thanks amazon ",positive

" besides the fact that ipod is a skinny little waste of time let's also mock the fact that it plays about two formats: whatever mac plays and mp3. woohoo. what a selection. then we have the iaudio. it has perhaps a half inch thickness at most over the ipod for the standard battery model (20gb and 30gb anyway; 60gb is as thick as an xl) though it includes so much more bang for your buck even if some of that bang is kind of useless. but come on; an fm radio isn't ipod standard? almost every other portable hd player has that by now. about the only thing ipod has over iaudio is movie quality which is admittedly better. but i'm fairly basic; i'm buying it for my music not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen. if i want to do that i'll buy a portable dvd player. for pictures unless they're ridiculously high quality this suits just fine. but it's not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players; it's the sound quality. which. is. marvelous. it consistantly beats ipod it has bbe equalizer and it not plays mp3 and aac but wma wav ooc and flac. *flac.* and if you download rockbox (which is something you'll have to research on your own kids) you can create themes boost your battery life and augment your listening pleasure even further. the only drawbacks are the battery life if you don't use playlists skip around a lot or play high bitrate files (all of which are fixed rather well by rockbox) and the subpack. what is a subpack? it's a fairly good idea done badly. it's a piece of [...] plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player. in it are the power jack line-out (which has a bad bass roll-off problem unfortunately) and line-in jack and usb port. the general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else but it wasn't executed too well. buying a charger from [...].com solves the power jack and usb port problems nicely and is recommended most highly. (and did i mention recording with the built-in mic is amazing? you can get good quality concerts with this puppy.) plus it's black. ipod comes standard white. and the x5 is just better ",positive

" things that i like: (1) the option to tile the front of the keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable. i was a skeptic about it before i purchased it but really do like it. also this is the first keyboard that i have used that allows for so many typing angles. (2) the included software gives a great deal of control over customizing all of the extra keys on the keyboard. even if you don't have windows vista you can program the gadgets key to suit your needs. (3) the keyboard has no lag for me whatsoever. (4) i'm a big fan of the standard 3x2 key setup for the home keys etc. (5) this is a small change but i'm using this setup on dell inspiron 6000 laptop. the software replaced the large volume notifications (onscreen display showing volume level mute etc.) with a smaller more attractive style notification. me gusta. (6) the curved keyboard is also comfortable. it requires no time nor effort getting used to it. (7) i haven't had any problems with the keyboard being out of range. (8) for the mouse i'm switching from the wireless intellimouse explorer 3.0 which is also made by microsoft to the laser 6000 mouse included. this new mouse is more comfortable. (not a huge difference but noticeable.) it is also lighter and slides around with little effort. what i don't like: (1) the lock key above the number pad is set by default to display the same two options as when you click 'start' then 'log off windows.' i would have liked the option to change the key to the shut down / hibernate dialog instead. i haven't found that option available so far. (2) the keyboard is a little bit wider than others but i don't find it to be a problem. it's just different. having the additional programmable buttons outweighs the downside of having the extra width. five stars ",positive
" i needed a replacement receiver for a fairly modest home theater system. i wanted a bare bones 5.1 system (no 6.1 7.1 1kw audio power satellite radio capable etc.) i only use the receiver as an audio switch and let the tv handle video source selection. reviewers of the sherwood rd-6500 liked the audio but thought the set-up a little confusing. being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me. the price was certainly right about the cheapest thing around (at [...]). i bought the unit and have been completely satisfied. i would have given it five stars but heck nobody's perfect. i had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality (full disclosure: my ears are 79 years old). the unit has one optical digital one coax digital and several a/v inputs. the remote lets you pick video 1-3 cd tuner and aux inputs. you tell the system which audio source to use for each of these one time and it remembers. i liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present. i was surprised to find how many premium hd movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in hd either. i also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them. on the negative side i like other reviewers bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub-woofer is required ",positive

" this is a direct comparision between the linksys wusbf54g and trendnet 509ub. both perform as expected when used as a standalone hot spot detector. both perform as expected on windows xp. installation was quirky for both. after driver installation inserting into usb slot it wasn't recognized at all. fiddled around for awhile and it finally detected the device. had to disable the notebook's builtin wireless before xp recognized the device. client software does not detect a device under windows vista ultimate rc2. i assume this will be true for windows vista rtm too. inserting the device into a windows vista rc2 system often completely froze windows vista (had to hold down power button for complete reboot). had to disable the notebook's builtin wireless before vista recognized the device. appears that the trendnet and linksys devices are so similar that they must be made by the same oem or reference design. as expected evaluation results are similar. 1. both devices seem to have same sensitivity similar to notebook's internal wireless card. 2. trendnet device doesn't have windows xp signed drivers so an extra click during install is requried. also installing on new usb ports requires extra clicks. 3. trendnet device supports 801.11a whereas linksys does not. 4. trendnet device sometimes crashes vista ultimate rc2. 5. neither device's software client works under vista ultimate rc2. this isn't a deal breaker for me as they both work under vista ultimate rc2 networking as a usb wireless key. you just lose the client software feature. 6. the linksys has a somewhat useful backlit lcd trendnet does not. 7. both devices work as standalone hotspot locators equal well. 8. in hotspot mode both devices show ssid channel number encryption mode etc. conclusion: for xp i recommend the trendnet so save the extra dollars. for vista i recommend the linksys device as it never crashed vista ultimate rc2 whereas trendnet device was gave occasional freezes ",positive

" if you're considering the viamichelin (under $200 gps) you're probably trying to decide if a gps that is more than $100 cheaper (much more than $100 in some cases) than its competitors is really any good. honestly i would have been skeptical too however a relative bought one of these units and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before i decided to purchase one myself. my brief summary is that yes this unit is a good gps and a great value. after using mine on a trip i'd have a hard time justifying the more expensive models when this one works fine. background: my gps experience is limited to a 7-year old garmin iii plus. i had to plan detailed trips on my pc using mapsource then upload the waypoints and routes to the gps. it could be a time consuming process and because the unit wasn't necessarily user friendly my wife never learned how to use it. enter the viamichelin. we just went on a weekend trip and had a chance to test the unit. set-up time for the trip was about a minute - all i had to do was program in the street address of our destination. now for the rundown. first - what it doesn't do well. a) using it for the past two weeks (as a test only) around my home town i was a little disappointed. it never sent me the wrong way but it didn't always take the best route. some of the routing issues were because of very new road construction in the area; and in some cases old logging roads are still in the database where new subdivisions have been built; and it may not calculate what my experience dictates to be the better route. although this was disconcerting at first i don't think it is a big deal as you'll see later. b) macro-directions - i.e. for a several hundred mile trip. it will get you there and if you're taking a route that involves some smaller roads between towns this would be a good device if you aren't familiar with the route. but my route this weekend was very simple. get to the interstate and drive. it didn't pick my preferred route to the interstate and it wanted to route me through a city before putting me on the interstate when you can take a four-lane road for 4 miles to another connection to the interstate. (although it did recover and finally suggest my route as i stubbornly drove my way.) so for a major trip i'd recommend an internet mapping package for the primary route. use this device if you have a lot of mind-numbing turn-by-turn. now what it does well: a) voice prompts are great. it doesn't matter that it doesn't say the street names. turn right in 300 feet is good enough - especially with the map that you can glance at. b) it did great around my destination towns of charlotte nc; gastonia nc and rock hill sc. did it take the best route as i drove from soccer fields to hotels to restaurants? i don't know since i wasn't familiar with the areas but the routes seems to be just fine they got me exactly where i needed to go and i never had to look at a road map. and after all this was the main reason i needed a newer gps. it passed this with flying colors. c) my wife did some of the set-up while in the car. she'll be using this one on her on very soon. d) we wanted to find a particular restaurant but didn't have the street address. the restaurant was in the points of interest database and it took us right to it. also finding rest stops or nearby dining while traveling on the interstate was great. i also found a feature that was not listed in the 89-page manual. from the navigation map if you touch the screen it has a bypass route option. it will give you some distant options (1 mi 5 mi etc.) then it will find a bypass route for you. so if you are approaching road construction or a traffic jam this will route you off the interstate take you up the road and bring you back on. obviously you could just turn off the interstate and start driving but then it's going to try to turn you around and/or try to get you back on sooner than you prefer. the bypass route lets you see where it is taking you by zooming out. in the future i would like to do a side-by-side comparison w/ a more expensive (borrowed) gps. also after more experience i'd like to update this review. bottom line: i am glad i bought this unit. i cannot imagine spending $100-$500 more on a more expensive model. though the higher priced models may have better features the value for the extra money just isn't there for me ",positive
" one of the few of these type of items available on the market. i bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews. i had received some free drives from newegg (seagate) and needed to house them. this was a no brainer set up. the utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off. (xp pro sp2). the firmware was one rev prior so i updated it - absolutely smooth as silk. reformatted the drives. i chose the raid 1 option and ext3 format. i like the fact that you can specify raid size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume. the drive is fairly solid. the fan is not very noisy. the front slide up access door is a little kludgy. good user interface. i was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen raid and ext3. the only thing i can never get to work and it is 100% my lack of knowledge is the email alerts. i couldn't get infrant to do it and same with this one. as an aside i love amazon and newegg. great retailers both of them ",positive
" had mine for over half a year now and after outstanding abuse it performs as well as the day i bought it. i fill it and empty it every month rarely ever defragging it back up my pc files and play movies right off it on my laptop. throw it in my backpack plug and unplug it all day(hotswaping) still with rarely a sign of slowdown and it barely gets from cool to warm ever(even when its running from inside my backpack). for some reason requires two usb ports on my new pc (high speed usb2.0 ports) when it shouldn't. it runs on one port at school just fine and i have switched the y cable with a regular usb cable with 50% success. i'd buy another one of these in a heartbeat if i ever thought the one i have would run itself out. the fact that it doesn't need an external ac adapter to run on my usb1.1 laptop ports(though it does have a hole for a non-included ac adapter)is a blessing. i've even used its double usb cord to run my power hog of an external cd-rom drive(my cd-rom ac doesnt work on both sadly). might be luck of the draw hd related items seem to be sometimes and i've yet to have to try out their customer service. but overall worth every cent spent(especially since i was looking at a 4gb external for $40 before i saw this). nearly $1 a gig is a great deal.

" i originally bought this cd case for my car because i listen to cds the most while driving. this was not a good case to bring back and forth at all. it is very large and heavy (even without cds!) and the long zipper-tail makes it hard to open with one hand. i now use it to house computer software and playstation/gamecube games. for what you pay it is an excellent buy ",positive

" i use this on my macbook. works flawlessly to hookup a tv via svideo. osx handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that i use when i have it hooked up. plug it in and video switches to tv settings unplug it and its back to normal. i use this with dual view mode so that my desktop stays the same always on the macbook and i just get extra desktop space when i plug the tv in. the quality is quite suprising for s-video very good. 100% must have for anyone that has a nice tv : ",positive
" it works fine but it gets really annoying when you're using it with a widescreen mac and a widescreen tv. the zoom function most plasmas and lcd tvs have is 16:9 aspect ratio whereas macs are at 16:10 aspect ratio so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you're trying to display or have massive letter-boxing. after three months i still haven't had any glitches that were this adapter's fault. if you have hdmi or dvi on your tv or projector don't bother with this. go straight to dvi with a mini-dvi to dvi adapter then get a dvi to dvi cord or a dvi to hdmi cord ",positive

" after reading several reviews of this product i was skeptical about buying this cable. i wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my ps2 but i was not sure about paying the price for these when the sony cables are about half the cost of the monster cables. the reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the ps2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the tv almost discouraged me from even buying this product. i decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my ps2. i am very happy that i decided to buy these cables. the cable connector fits perfectly into my ps2 better than the connector on my original sony cables even. the connectors fit nicely onto my tv they are snug but not too tight. i believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my tv because of the 8-cut turbine connector which fits better than a standard rca plug. the video and audio from my ps2 is unbelievable. my ps2 pushes the video signal to my 32 lcd hd tv at 480i with these cables. with my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry. now the graphics are crisp and clear and i only wish i would have bought these sooner. the display from my ps2 and games fits nicely onto my tv in widescreen now too before the picture was not centered on my tv and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen. i would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their ps2 over the stock sony cables. there are other monster cable versions for the ps2 available so choose the one that is right for you but if you want something that is moderately priced don't need digital audio via fiber and the next best thing to hdmi than this is the cable for you. i am going to get the monster component cables for my ps3 next so i will be able to hook it up when i don't have hdmi available for it to use. one more thought be sure to change the video output on your ps2 from rgb to y cb/pb cr/pr in the system configuration before hooking up your ps2 with these cables or it may not work. my tv told me the connection was not supported and i did not have video output until i changed the video output setting on my ps2 ",positive

" this cartridge is very light easy to install and allows the printer to print out very good quality durable black ink on the page. it is competitively priced and stores for about a year after you buy it so if you want to stock up for your office or personal printing needs that's great! (it even comes with an expiration date!) hp also packs it well so that it is difficult for the cartridge to become damaged during transit. one thing that i didn't like however is that the ink can go quickly. if you print a lot you might even need to replace this cartridge every ten days or so. my needs are about 20 pages per week and i have to change the cartridge roughly every five to six weeks. that's not good; although to be fair to this hp ink cartridge i am printing graphics. four stars (well maybe three and one half stars) for being great ink in an easy to manage and install cartridge. it loses points for not lasting longer.

" i've been struggling with heat issues for quite some time with my gaming pc and have gone through numerous fans and combinations trying to find a way to keep it cool. i had just about resigned myself to just running with the case open all the time until i bought this. after shuffling my pci cards around so as to allow a space between this and my 6800 ultra i fired the machine up (and closed the case! ;-) and did some gaming all the while keeping an eye on the temperature of the card. this fan easily dropped the temperature on the card 5-7 degrees celsius when the graphics are running full bore.. once the chaos on the screen starts to subside the cooling is even better. as an added bonus this will cool the card down quick once you exit your game. i thought for sure that i would have to trade off cooling for a lot more noise and i was surprised to find that i had to listen for it in order to hear it. about the only complaint i have on this is that the fan speed is manual with a slider on the back (which i knew when i bought it) so it is not temperature sensitive. still deserves 5 stars though ",positive
" just purchased earbuds at target. excellent sound quality expected that much due to a previous of full headphones. even better once you find the right adjustable tip to fit your ear. well worth my 100 dollars granted i've only had them 5 to 10 minutes but i won't be returning them any time soon ",positive
" bought it for my wife and she loves it. it keeps track of where you were and restarts from there. the display is small (no fancy menus like ipod)but works well. sound is excellent. be sure to install the drivers and software. the software is small simple and easy to use - or you can just copy/paste files onto it. if you don't install the drivers it only works at usb 1.1 speeds and takes a lot longer to load songs. with drivers you get full 2.0 speeds ",positive
" i've never had a problem with these dvds. they burn and play perfectly and i've never had a problem printing on them. what's particularly nice about these is the printable area goes all the way to the hole. it doesn't sound like a big deal but it makes for nicer looking dvds. by the way i use an epson stylus photo r300 to print great photos and dvds ",positive
" this bluetooth remote device works as advertized with my apple notebook. be sure to insert the bluetooth card all the way into the printer slot before you begin. i thought mine was in far enough at first but it really wasn't. one caveat: i was hoping that the bluetooth signal would be strong enough to enable printing from the next room but it's not. also new users should know that they can set up their computer to handle both bluetooth and cable at the same time ",positive

" length of ownership: 8 weeks this puppy really reaches out. my laptop's internal intel/pro wireless sees about 6 networks but with the hawking dish a typical haul is 20 networks. thanks to some friendly neighbors i've said goodbye to my paid isp and now enjoy casual and free internet connections and until metrofi completes its set up of free city-wide wifi i'll get by with that thanks to this neat hawking device. unless i need the next and more expensive step up for such wifi booster devices i hope the hawking dish proves durable..after all it's been just 2 months of ownership so far albeit good ones. note: for me this device has not seemed very directional in that it will pick up off-beam signals fairly well. also placement by a window will help your reception ",positive

" i gave my mother-in-law my old color sportrack so she could start geocaching. i was in search of a handheld unit with a bigger brighter screen. this unit is it. although it is large it has features i like: aa batteries (19 hours? we'll see) easy menu navigation usb connection to a pc and a rugged case. i am an engineer so am kind of picky about user interfaces etc. i have sent in a list of problems i have found with the menu navigation. all of them can be worked around but it doesn't work the way i think they intended. it will be interesting to see if magellan gets back to me and eventually provides a new version of fw (i am using 1.05). after doing a lot of research about megllan sw (mostly negative) i decided to go ahead and purchase the mapsend directroute v.3 dvd. i found it acceptable and have had no real problems using it. one nit the files it creates are very small. you need to edit a text file in the magellan directoy to allow it to save and download larger files. but once you get the maps downloaded to your unit (very straight forward) the menus change to indicate turning direction. thus it is getting closer to a crossover unit. interestingly magellan will offer a new unit called the crossover (available january 2007). the specs are pretty sparse on the magellan web page ",positive

" the lexar jumpdrive lightning 2gb flash drive has very impressive performance ratings of 160x (24mb/sec) sustained read and 120x (18mb/sec) sustained write speed capability. this is one of the very few usb drives that lists the read/write speed capabilities. the reality of flash drives is that the smaller the file size the slower the transfer rate will be. i ran some tests with the lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes: * 433mb 784 medium files avg. 550kb 12x 4 min. 3 sec. * 483mb 81 large files avg. 6mb 54x 59 seconds * 1gb 1 very large file 115x 58 seconds so even though the write speed capability of the lightning is 120x the transfer rate drops to 12x with medium size files which is fairly real-world usage. but don't let that dissuade you from considering the lightning: the higher the speed capability of the device the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files. to prove this point i took one of my great deal cf cards (that had no speed ratings) that tops out at 36x read / 7x write and ran two of the same tests: * 433mb 784 medium files 3x 15 min. 10 sec. * 483mb 81 large files 7x 7 min. 48 sec. so compared to the lightning the great deal! card took nearly 4 times longer to write the medium files and 8 times longer to write the large files. so which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over... whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a usb flash drive if the performance numbers are not specified beware! what you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing. i know i have several in my drawer. so my bottom-line advice is: look for the highest-rated device you can find. flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow! so future-proof your purchase by shopping for a high-rated and large capacity for now and the future. (i have no relationship with lexar or the flash memory industry. ",positive

" i bought one for a relative last christmas. saw how convenient and easy it was to program. so i bought one for myself this march. it works just great. the setup software programs the 670 easily and the logitech remote replaces the remotes for a hdtv a dvd home theater a/v receiver a dishhd dvr receiver and a psyclone psc01 source selector. one button click now setups all those devices to the right status for a particular entertainment activity. i like the color screens and icons on the higher end logitech remotes .. but the discrete placement of buttons on the 670 is much more practical for me to use. function wins forms this time round. all is not rosy though. added the sony ps3 to the entertainment arena. the bluetooth requirements of the ps3 leaves it out of the ir rf remotes inner circle. consider this if you need a combined solution for infra red rf as well as bluetooth devices. ( the sony ps3 is deliberately left powered on so it is not an issue in this case). fully backlit is a signifcant bonus..none of the replaced remotes had adequate backlit features. short version: this cool tool really works and should satisfy most. think out of the box though if you have a sony ps3 tied into your entertainment network. ..click ",positive
" my wife and i have maybe a dozen or so devices connected via wifi spread throughout our four-bedroom home. among these were an avaya 4610sw sip (voip) phone and a pc serving as an asterisk server (asterisk is an open source pbx). this configuration has worked well for a couple of years now. in the past few months i've been having occasional disconnects of voip calls coming in to asterisk from the pstn. after some investigation i decided to move my phone and server off wifi and onto a homeplug network using the electrical wiring as another ethernet. the hardest part of the installation was freeing up an electrical outlet in my second-floor office where my phone is in the basement where the server is and in the family room on the first floor where the linksys wifi router/access point is located. after that it was just a matter of plugging in an ethernet cable from the netgear box to the router and moving the ethernet cables from the wifi boxes for the phone and server to the netgear boxes. it was that simple.

" i bought this phone and three expansion handsets about a year ago and couldn't be happier. the phones have the clarity of a corded phone. the built in intercom system is perfect. the phones allow you to name the handsets as we did (kitchen basement bedroom etc) so you can page based on location rather than remembering numbers. they have a reliable and effective speakerphone built in as well as jacks for headset (though the speakerphone seems to make this unnecessary. one problem with these phones is the batteries. in the year that we have had them the battery life on all of the phones has degraded severely. often my wife would be on conference calls for one to two hours and we would go through all four phones. leave a phone off the charger and in a day it's useless. the only solution was to replace the batteries (which was significantly cheaper and easier than buying new phones and re-programming all the phone numbers). i recommend the energizer er-p240 which is a nickel-metal hydride battery and won't develop the ni-cad memory effect. i love that the base station has a place for 4 aaa batteries so that the system can still be used during a power outage ",positive

" i have had this item for about 6 weeks. haven't used to a lot but so far i like it. this power inverter is smaller and looks nicer than my old one which was stolen out of my car along with a few other things. it has one electrical outlet and above that is a cigarette lighter outlet so if you have other devices that need that kind outlet you can use them while this power inverter is plugged in. the plug fits kind of loosely in my cigarette lighter outlet but i don't know if that's the plug or the outlet on my car. the only thing i don't like about this item is the no tangle cord. its one of those coiled up cords like a telephone cord (look at the picture of the item). the cord is long enough that it could stretch to the backseat but if i were to try this it would pull the plug out of the outlet. its coiled so tight that i couldn't really put it anywhere that would require the coil to be stretched. it just annoys me that they call it a 36 cord. for practical use not more than probably 18 but i don't have the item right in front of me to measure it. i'll still give this item 5 stars. 4.5 if amazon allowed 1/2 stars.

" i purchased the lj3390 to replace an existing lj3320. the $350 rebate available until the end of oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase. my main interest in the upgrade was to purchase a network connected printer. duplex print capability was the other factor that tipped the scale in favour of the lj3390 over the lj3052. i now have 3 desktop and 2 laptop printers all printing successfully. all run xp sp2 and are either connected via a wired or wireless network connection. software installation went flawlessly. while i can't comment about hp versus other vendor software i can say that the lj3390 software is a major improvement over that of my lj3320. scanning is faster by at least a factor of 2x quite likely more like 3-4x. printing of complex pages is also much faster exactly what i would expect from a newer generation print engine and an hp laserjet printer. all in all i am very pleased that i upgraded. it has met all my upgrade goals. printing is faster scanning is much faster. the network connectivity ensures anyone can print without another machine being forced to be a print server and constantly left on. i haven't played with the fax side yet but am hoping this finally let's me retire my trusty standalone fax machine.

" i received this product from an amazon.com seller for 1/2 the price of what best buy was selling it for. it was new and in an unopened box. upon opening the box i was able to tell right away that it was built very good. the hinges for the outer antenna sections are very sturdy and once locked in the open position were not going anywhere. i had spent over $300 for a runco antenna for my runco projector for local hd (directv does not have local hd in my area) and even with perfect mounting position outside was only getting at best 80% reception with it. this antenna with a similar design the the runco model is built better and i get between 94-98% reception depending on the channel (directional antenna so reception varies slightly). i was also amazed with the fact that i not only get local channels for youngstown ohio but i also get locals with over 60% reception from cleveland (direction antenna is facing) but also pittsburgh (which is on opposite side of house about 60 miles away and in opposite direction antenna is facing). great product and no issues with it so far. the included booster works better than the one built into my directv receiver so i advise hooking antenna up straight to your ant in on the back of your projector (if it has a built in hd tuner) or tv for best results ",positive

" after enduring the so-so performance of my stock ipod headphones i figured it was time to step up. as i travel constantly i wanted something that would would block out exterior noise; as a music freak i wanted something that would sound great. after countless hours of research and even more time debating on what brand of headphones to get (ue vs. shure vs. etymotics) i bought the super.fi 5 pros. in the end it was the price amazon was selling then for $90 less than the msrp. can't beat that. as soon as they were delivered i hooked them up and put them on. they aren't kidding when they tell you to turn your audio device way down. i keep the volume on my ipod way down a fraction of what i kept it at with the stock headphones. the room i was in faces a major road and we had the windows wide open so to say there was plenty of ambient noise would be an understatement. with the ues on it was just me and the music. a fire engine thundered by normally a painfully annoying experience. again the ues reduced it to the point that i didn't realize the fire engine was coming until i saw it drive by. as for the music. i first played a couple of tracks by jenny lewis and the watson twins. i immediately noticed elements to the music i never even heard with my other headphones. jenny lewis' angelic voice came through so beautifully clear it was like i was listening to them for the first time. next i put on some ray charles. with the ues it was like i was there in the front row. the horn section nearly kicked me out of me chair while i discovered that there was indeed a woodwind section. i've read complaints that in ear headphones don't produce enough bass so i decided to see for myself and played a couple of tracks from siamese twin by the smashing pumpkins. while i'm not by any means a bass head i need some bass to enjoy rock albums. i couldn't have been happier with how the ues performed. the drums in the album (which i've always considered some of the best) came alive. the guitars actually had some balls but didn't overpower the singing or drums. as is the case when you stick things in your ears for a period of time your ears are bound to hurt a little. i found this to be the case only for a day or two after that the ues fit snugly without any complaint. the only weird thing i encountered had to do with ear wax. my wife an audiologist forbids the family from using q-tips. so after taking the ues off for the first couple of times there was a nice deposit left on the tips of the headphones. like the discomfort this earwax experience only lasted for the first couple of times i used the ues and with the supplied earwax cleaner it was really a non issue. when there are so many excellent products out there finding the perfect headphones becomes extremely challenging. i've never tried on shures or etymotics so i can't compare the performance of those headphones and the ues. what i do know is that i got a really great deal on the best headphones i've ever had. without a doubt these are the last pair of headphones i will buy for some time.

" this is an awesome little device. let me start with the pros: 1) easy: incredibly easy setup (literally press one button - never believed it but it's true. plug in the usb transmitter press the blue button & voila.) 2) good sound: for a small set of speakers these things sound great. they are not going to compare to speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system but sound very good and comparable to a $45 two-speaker set of monitor-side speakers. there's a built in sub-woofer that helps as well. 3) wireless range: with 4 aa batteries you can carry this little guy around your whole house - and outside your house. reception is great. i am used to bluetooth headsets that don't really work much further than 10 feet from the phone - i had doubts about bluetooth speakers but i am amazed with reception these guys have. 4) controls: the forward reverse & pause buttons on the speaker work fine with both media player or yahoo music engine running on the laptop(the only two i tried). again i was surprised but they worked flawlessly. 5) cool: as far as cool factor this little guy is definitely that. cons: 1) no remote: it would be nice if there was a remote control for the unit that would allow you to control the sound ff rw pause play controls. 2) no control from pc: you can't control the sound (or mute) from the laptop - only from the speakers. 3) sound: above i said the sound was good - and it is considering the size of this system. however these are small speakers and a mini-sub and the sound is thus somewhat small too. it's good but it's not going to compare to a quality set of speakers hooked up to your rack stereo system. there is base but not a great deal - you definitely won't feel the music with these speakers. 4) volume: volume is limited - it's enough to fill a mid-sized room but not much more. for $100 this is an outstanding little speaker system that does an amazing job with no wires. carry it to your kid's room. to the garage. to the basement. no wires nothing. if convenience is and portability is important to you and if medium sound quality is ok then i would highly recommend this speaker system. it's great. personally i'm not sure if i'm going to keep them because i would really like fuller sound (this was an attempt at easy speakers for my living room) and more base - but they're so cool and convenient that i doubt i'll be able to give them up! for other bluetooth ideas and wi-fi network options see my post at the hydrogen audio forum: [...] ",positive

" i have really bad luck with head sets (i dropped a vise on my last set really)these are really well built headphones it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set. they can get very loud and not crack exceptional base and mic is very very clear. they are light but feel solid although i have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong. i have very big ears that is one of the reasons i bought this head set it is very comfortable. the only thing i don't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups but maybe it help keep your ears cool maybe. i really give them 4 1/2 stars. i paid about $90 for them and i have no regrets. so if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they don't have mics but good headphones. hope this helped good luck ",positive

" this armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen (stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector). it works well for jogging and working out. the neoprene (better than leather for sweaty workouts) armband fits well on my upper arm (6' 200lb) and seems pretty adjustable to other size arms. it is a bit awkward to silde the nano into the skin while keeping the screen protector in place. i first began sliding the nano into the armband mount but found that difficult to keep the screen protector in place so i now just clip it in which seems to work fine. it has tried to come loose from the armband a couple of times but i think this was due to not ensuring the nano was fully seated into the armband. i have only used the armband for about 3 weeks now and i am satisfied at this point i am only giving 4 stars due to the screen protector being scuffed out of the package and there could have been better documentation included. also on another note apple should have centered the hold button on the top of the nano because almost all protectors i have seen make it somewhat difficult to access the button and this one is no exception. the button is next to the upper left edge and any decent protector has to almost cover this area to work properly. all in all you will be satisfied with the armband and remember for the price your are getting a skin for everday protection of the nano and a good armband also so it's a solid value.

" i bought these for my zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding compact headphone for work and working out at the gym. if you are like me and can't stand all the earbuds out there then you need to find another solution. i tried the premium zune buds at 40 bucks and the bose quiet comfort buds at 100 bucks but they just gave me earaches and i was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight. i read countless reviews of this headphone and i can say this is the best sounding under $40 headphone out there that won't mess with your hair. (yes better than even the bose earbuds!) if you are only using the stock buds or phones with your mp3 player be prepared to be blown away. tight full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids. you don't have to crank them either they sound rich even at lower volumes. but if you do crank them they don't distort at all. if you have ever tried the bose quiet comforts at the stores these sound very similar but with an open air design! the only negative is the comfort. the little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after 30 minutes or so. i think i'll get used to it. i'd much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs. jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal (which i had). that could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems. some other reviewers complained about the headband but it sounds like they were not wearing these right. once on your noggin the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head. this keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort. i do not think the headband is too tight it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place. i might buy a pair of the px 100's as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading. the px 100 is the same exact phone in an over the head design. at $40 i can afford to get both ",positive
" when my cds started skipping i thought they has seen the last days of spinning however this disc cleaner has solved all problems. you simply put the cd into the cleaner with the label side down. then you spray the disc cleaner to the disc surface. you only apply one even spray of cleaner. then you close the case and make sure the lid is totally closed. once you have cranked the movable part of the lid about 5 times you can remove the disc and let it dry completely. most of the cleaner was absorbed into the cleaning pad after the recommended 5 rotations. i found that 8 or 9 rotations did the trick. the first time i used this cleaner i was a bit frustrated with it because i noticed little pieces of black foam all over my cds. apparently there is a little piece of foam in the middle that looks like it belongs there and it seems glued down but once i removed that piece of foam all was go. this unit comes with one additional cleaning pad. i think if you are just using this to remove fingerprints you won't have to replace the cleaning pads very often. handy gadget to prolong disc life and restore performance to contaminated disc surfaces. ~therebeccareview.com ",positive

" i purchased this usb light/fan combo mainly for the fan. i'm one of those guys who is a human heater -- always a little warmer than everyone else. i use this fan when i'm studying in the library on the computer at a coffee shop or even at home using my laptop at the desk. it provides a nice little jet of air right at my face which makes me feel cooler all over. i can even direct it right in front of me and only the nose of the rotor head is visible because when the fan is running of course you can see right through the blades. the fan runs quietly too. i've had a couple of times when the fan is making a bit of a noise or isn't running a quickly as normal. i just pop off the rotor head adjust the blades a bit (they are flexible vinyl and i give them a little twist and a crease to make them more rigid as they sometimes get bent in my carrying case) pop the rotor head back on and it's good as new again. while i like this product a lot i doubt with frequent use that it will last much more than a year but i still think it's well worth it. my only regret is that i didn't order two or three of these for future back-ups if needed. the light works well too. it does not illuminate the entire keyboard but in a dark setting it does provide enough illumination for the typical user (a hunt and peck typist may be frustrated but i think it may be enough light for that kind of visibility as well) and definitely enough light to read from a book or hard copy document.

" after reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my ipod. i had read a lot about how it interefered with the usb cable or the hold switch. but i couldn't argue with the price. i must say that this product it actualy one of the best aftermarket ipod products i have puchased. it does exactly what it is supposed to do protect my ipod. i have no trouble opperating any of the ipod's buttons and i simply remove the case when i charge the unit. i have not found that it impairs the functionality of the ipod at all while keeping it securely around my neck. it is perfect for jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites. i find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion. ultimately it perfectly protects my ipod when i am out and about which is what it was designed to do. the reasons i gave it 4 and not 5 stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little. and i whished they had mounted the ipod right side up like they did on the nano model. over all i am well please ",positive
" for the price these speakers are well worth the cost. of course in my opinion anything that dosnt say creative on it is usually worth the price. not a lot of bass but with the bass boost these speakers sound real nice. only bad thing i'll say is that m-audio's tech department is really bad. emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for vista still no answer.

" the six commonly used power tips provide flexibility with this product. i purchased this to use as an interface between a cd walkman player and the ac power cord. the heads have specific polarity; so it is possible to attach the heads incorrectly. however if you pay attention to the plus and minus hookups as indicated it's not too difficult to make the attachment correctly the first time. i found the product to work effectively. the only negative i can see is that the actual plug-in device is a bit bulky; so if you want to use this in a power strip setting the ah3wh can be a bit of a plug hog. however other than that limitation the product was reliable. recommended to save on those batteries which do add up ",positive
" i have been putting this television through its paces since i got it a few weeks ago and it is by far the best tv i have ever owned and very difficult to beat. the image quality is really good with bright vivid colors and wonderful detail especially for 1080i/p content but even lower-resolution 720p content which is what's more commonly-available on ota hd broadcast looks phenomenal. i also have an apple tv hooked up to it and even though most of my content is encoded at either 360p 480p or 720p it still looks quite good. it does take some time to get the image tuned to perfection and the default settings are way too bright with too much color saturation boost and the dnie processing system actually seems to make some motion effects worse. however it's very easy to change the settings and see immediately what effect they have. like all lcds it does have some slight black point problems; these aren't noticeable for fullscreen 16:9 content but for older 4:3 content it's pretty obvious that the black isn't pure black. however this is again tunable. the only thing i really notice which is pretty annoying is that it doesn't do a very good job of upscaling 480i content such as the output from most video game systems and for dvds to look good you really need an upconverting player since even with a progressive-scan player there is a lot of visible pixelation when the 480p content is scaled up. it's really more a sad reflection on how the previous next-generation video looks downright primitive by today's standards. the other noticeable issue is that unlike many televisions with digital tuners it doesn't have an on-screen program guide. my previous tv (also a samsung) had an on-screen program guide but it was rather cumbersome to use and took several minutes of scanning every channel to see what was on and most local channels are pretty inconsistent about providing the epg information anyway so it's not really that big of a deal. you can still see the detailed information for the program that's currently showing so it makes use of epg just not as much as it could. this television's tuner is also quite phenomenal. my previous tv required a very carefully-positioned powered antenna which was very sensitive to every little nearby fluctuation while with this one i only have a piece of wire jammed into the antenna port and i get perfect reception of every local digital station. another nice improvement over samsung's older hdtvs is that it has a wide variety of zoom modes which allow you to counteract some of the stupider things that tv stations do (for example pillboxing a letterboxed 16:9 show which is very common for widescreen non-hd programming). also analog tv stations and source inputs get their audio signals upconverted to digital so you only need to run a single optical audio connection to your stereo (while previous samsungs required running both analog and digital cables and switching between the two inputs based on source material). as a pc monitor this is also quite nice. i have a mac mini hooked up via svga cable and even with an analog signal it looks perfectly sharp and crystal-clear and of course you can hook it up via hdmi (with a dvi to hdmi adaptor) as well. the only gripe there is that the supported resolutions are a bit quaint - at least on analog svga the only 16:9 resolution it supports is 1920x1080 which can be difficult for some older systems to handle. however on hdmi it should support all the standard hd resolutions. this television may be more expensive than others in its size class but it also far outshines every other tv i have seen aside from the newer ln-t4065 which is nearly identical aside from providing a higher dynamic contrast ratio. if you want to only buy one tv which will last for a long time it would be hard to go wrong with this one ",positive

" i just added this to my onkyo htib system and it's made all the difference in the world. i'm a bit of an audiophile (on a reasonable budget) with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10 polk in my truck. i'm most satisfied with the polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess. i listen to a lot of music with double-bass drumming and thought that this psw12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10 sub i like so much. not the case. what i get is very quick bass with that ground-shaking impact that i always look for. i'm still going easy on 'er for the break-in period but i can say that the trailer for kingdom of heaven (included on the blu-ray disc) sounds absolutely stunning. paired with my 57 sony hdtv trips to the movie theater are few and far between these days. now is a great time to pick up one of these since the price seems to have recently dropped by about $50 throughout the web. unbeatable sub for the money!

" i'm a fanatic for duplexing since i move a lot of paper around sometimes amounts which i have to carry to court or mail and which weigh several pounds. the brother is one of the better machines for the price that handles duplexing well maybe even the best. this particular machine has wireless g built-in but it costs over $100 more than the same machine without wireless and for well over $100 you can probably manage to do the same thing cheaper maybe even better and for my office wireless is inappropriate. (it also should be stated that if you go outside briother itself then the wireless combo is cost-effective. brother essentially competes here only with itself.) that said it makes for an elegant solution in the home if you have any sort of barrier to wiring and would like a single piece of equipment to handle everyone's printing if several of you are running off of a wireless router. there are a bevy of bonuses if this machine is otherwise appropriate for you. it's a complete standalone fax/copier if someone in the house doesn't even have any computer at all. i'm a long-time brother customer and they've made operation more intuitive for both computer users and standalone. there were a few bugs in earlier machines by brother (comparable but older machines i've owned like the 8500 and the 9700) such as faulty out-of-toner warnings and all of these seem to have been worked out. this machine is clearly out of beta. earlier machines were difficult (though not impossible) to set up and use advanced functions without using your manual and this machine is far better on that aspect as well. you can have faxes arrive two-sided which doubles your paper tray effectively and you can scan or fax a two-sided document just by feeding it in and possibly altering a setting. this last is made possible by the physical arrangement and just as much by the aforementioned ease-of-use - you wouldn't use the feature much if you had to do major messing around with menus just send out a two-sided page. unfortunately the one bane of all printers which is slightly worse with the brothers is the ink aspect. unlike some competitors you have to replace a toner and a drum and at differing intervals. i assume they do this to keep the costs low but the costs still aren't particularly low. the non-wireless version of the basic machine sells for a little over $400 and there is no problem spending that much for just a couple of drums and a few toners. i don't understand why printers of all sorts cannot just have a gas tank you could fill with cheap ink and then just add paper but in most instances the consumables are the tail wagging the dog in terms of buying a printer. the brother is a superbly-functioning modern machine at a great price but don't imagine the price ends when you buy it. this is true of all printers however and the news with most printers is worse than here ",positive

" i would encourage anyone in the market for a shredder to first identify where the machine is to be placed! if you want something cute and compact then keep looking. this sb-97cs is a work horse in every sense of the word. consequently it may not appeal to one's feminine traits. although the size can be a bit formidable for home use it's power and relatively quiet operation set the standard for all others. i was surprised at just how quiet it was! the controls are easy to master and the safety features are good to have for the occasional inquisitve child. having had a lessor (un-named) shredder i knew that my shredding needs were beyond the waste-paper-basket sized machines for less money. being one who regularly shreds credit card bait checks and other sensitve info that accumulates through the years this sb-97cs shredder was a must have. i doubt that i'll outgrow this machine. i've had this shredder for only a couple of months now and i expect to have it for many years to come. it is necessary to oil the cutters after each full basket though. if you are the disciplined and conscientious type this is not a problem. however i can see the lifespan of this machine being cut short by the negligent types who don't read instructions..

" a lot of tv for little money. great picture and the refresh rate is fast enough to prevent most of the blurring that you tend to see on low end lcd's. initial setup can be tricky because olevia chose to include a cd version of the operators manual though you can print a paper version from the cd or olevia website. better than average sound but the side speakers add a bit to the overall width. after tweaking the factory settings we achieved a nice color balance without any of the black level problems that plague many lcd's. if you're using it in a bedroom you'll most likely be annoyed by the very bright on/off light on the front panel. rear panel connections are intuitive and easily accessible and wall-hanging was a breeze. looked at many lcd televisions and there are better choices for sure but it's hard to beat the performance of this set at the low price. highly satisfied!

" i had great hope for this product. it has mostly so far lived up to my expectations. here are some caveats... i was hoping for the ability to set up music catagories...easy listening dinner music light jazz...etc. you have to cheat to do this and using the manual is daunting. instead of using the artist as artist i used it as a catagory code ie making one artist light jazz etc. this works but you do of course lose the artist registration ability. so now i can select artist dinner music and then all discs and shuffle and the unit will play a track from one dinner music cd then shuffle to another track on another dinner music cd etc making a delightful mix of music that never is repeated exactly the same way. i am still in the loading phase of coexistance with this machine so longetivty and flawlessness are not being reviewed here. that remains to be seen. the manual is purely awfull. just dig in and try things. that's the only way to get a handle on things. hope this helps....good luck!

" i recently purchased the pacific breeze laptop cooler and so far am very impressed with it. now this review should be taken with a grain of salt because i have only had the cooler for a few weeks but i feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate. the reason that i was in search of a cooler was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps. i installed notebook hardware control (free temperature and power control utility) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55c at my hard drive! worried about how this would affect the hard drive's longevity i started looking around at coolers. i choose this cooler after reviewing several of the mat variety but chose this one because of its design. as the previous reviewers have already mentioned this cooler elevates the notebook from the rear and blows air under the notebook. this allows the cpu fan intake and hard drive to receive plenty of fresh air. after setting this cooler up i was feeling pretty good about the purchase. qualitatively the results are evident by a cooler notebook top and keypad and the feel of air exiting the sides of the notebook. quantitatively the notebook experienced a 5c temperature drop at my hd and at my cpu. now my hard drive is running at 40c-45c instead of 45-50c! i would definitely recommend this product ",positive

" wow i'm surprised by the reviews made here about this product. despite the bad reviews i bought it anyway. i still believe in a motorola. guess what? not bad. i bought this phone set and 4 of its satellites to replace my siemens. the siemens was the best phone when it first came out about 5 years ago. this moto phone has the features most people will ever need. the shared phonebook is very valuable. a loud speakerphone on each handset is priceless. incoming and outgoing sound quality is excellent. i don't understand why there are several reviews here stating the phone has bad sound quality. ok the range is not as good as my 2.4ghz phone but it is not bad for someone with an average size home. after about 75 meters with 3 walls in between i can start to hear the voice i'm speaking to crackles. i just did this for test but i can get clear voice anywhere in my 4 bedroom house. i am running a 2ghz wi-fi and do not hear any interference. with regard to the phonebook i wish i can enter more characters each address! the maximum characters i can enter is only 11. i think i can enter about 20 on my siemens. another minor quirk is when someone called i could just lift the phone off its charging base and start talking to the other party. not with this phone. i still have to press the flash bottom everytime before i can start talking. build quality is excellent. it is a little on the heavy side which i like probably because it uses 4 rechargeable batteries and made of thick plastic. even if i squeeze the handset hard i didn't hear that plasticky noise and feeling of the plastic warping. i tried the pana v-tech uniden ge and att in a local store and the motorola is tops. you will not see a rubbery wiggly buttons here. i personally think this is the best phone among the few remaining brands around. if you do not see it that way it must be a quality defect that can happen on any product.

" below is my experience with this product after owning it for 2 weeks. pros: ----- 1. amazing sound especially when watching dvd movies 2. very good progessive scan dvd picture quality 3. simple compact and all-in-one design 4. remote control can work with various tv's cable boxes and vcr's 5. can play both ntsc and pal dvd's cons: ----- 1. expensive 2. no hdmi output 3. non-intuative remote control 4. no headphone jack overall i love and chose the bose 321 because of the sound quality and compact design. i got this system because i wanted a compact all-in-one media center and i was not interested in getting a htib with 5 speakers. i looked at denon (2 products) sony and samsung. i use this on my 23 samsung lcd tv using monster component video cables and while i would have preferred to take advatange of its hdmi capabilties the reality is that i am very happy with this image quality. movies such as lord of the rings the matrix and hero look and sound fantastic. prior to this i was looking at the sony dav-x1 which is much cheaper and more feature-rich. however the internal turmoils between their consumer electronics and media divisons convince me this would not work for me. for example my pal dvds cannot be played on the sony whereas on the bose it was no problem. i am of the opinion that sony is a directionless company and this is reflected in their products. to be fair you do need to have the right kind of room to take advantage of their truespace 2.1 surround sound feature. my couch is up against the wall with the media center located 12 ft in front of me. according to bose the speakers should ideally be 3 feet away from the tv. sometimes truespace works and sometimes i can't hear it. i believe this is true among all the other competitors in this market line and that neither one stands out ahead of the other. if surround sound is really that important to you then you should get a 5.1 system. this product is perfect for a small room as it takes advantage of the echos of the room where it can fake a 3d sound and would probably not be ideal for a family size rec-room. the audio quality from music cd's is very good and while i wish this had an ipod port as found on the denon i am very content using the aux port ",positive

" i wanted a simple printer so i could print a few prints from time to time to hand out. on sale for $50 this seemed like the right one. i already had the included zoombrowser and photo stitch software installed from my prior purchase of a canon a95 camera so i just needed to install the driver. note this requires a usb cable (not included) to the printer. as is human nature i tried to print without reading the zoombrowser instructions and got a lovely plain sky-blue print with the words my album on it - but no photo :-) then out came a stunning second print which was totally blank but with some faint horizontal lines - this was from a residual click from my first attempt. ok ok so i looked at the pdf printing guide for about 15 seconds and followed the instructions. got a beautiful first print of the queen mary ship. got a gorgeous second print of flags (red/white/blue and green) againt a clear blue sky and the third print was very nice of a field of flowers near mt lassen (ironically the original proof print of this from 20 years ago was scanned onto my computer just today to get rid of paper prints...) so i've blown through the provided trial 5 sheets of paper and film cartridge and have 3 very nice prints (with postcard address lines stamp area and canon logo on the back - the paper comes that way.) the ends of the paper remain white but have perforations about 1/2 inch from the end so you can remove them after printing. i can't compare the printing software to any other brand but setting up a plain photo-only print takes about 10 seconds of menu choices. if you want to add backgounds titles/text etc that is available as well. (got another pack of paper/film and put humorous captions on kind of funny-bad office christmas pix...) printing directly from my a95 takes about the same time as from the computer - about 1 min 45 sec. the actual operation involves the paper being passed in and out of the printer 4 times (3 color passes and a protective layer) so it is important the back of the printer is not obstructed particularly by the power cord which hangs down near the edge of the slot. the finished print is deposited on top of the paper cassette in front. the unit looks and feels substantial for its small size comes well packed (survived ny to ca shipping) has decent documentation and a 1-year warranty.

" every house should have a grundig s350 deluxe. big brawny grabbing in all the hard-to-get stations with ease championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business the grundig s350 deluxe version is a bigger better version of the old grundig s350 eliminating some of the drift problems of the earlier model. the speaker on the deluxe is bigger and brighter. whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin the grundig s350 dl has depth. is it a perfect radio? no. you don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. you get a little am overload. here in los angeles i get overload on 1150 so that i'm listening to two shows at once. also the cheaper (and cheaper built) ge superradio boasts an internal am ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better am. if you're looking for a radio with similar features as the grundig s350 dl but erases its weakness--no presets and am overload then you might want to check out the grundig g4000a. it's the same price as the s350 and its speaker is surprisingly good for a digital preset shortwave radio. or you might look at the stunning kaito 1103 or its more expensive cousin the eton e5. but even if you get a fancy preset radio every house should have the big easy-to-use grundig s350 deluxe. update: comparing the s350 to the same-priced g4000 for several months it becomes clear that the g4000 is a better buy: superior am superior separation of am stations presets same warm speaker and smaller.

" i live in an apartment building and play ( well practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so i wouldn't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs tv about 6 feet from where i sit and play. the 10 foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing so i wouldn't have to use an extention cable ( and usualy end up with feedback/distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable) the volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so i don't have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings i like to use when not using headphones. makes it real nice too when using an instructional cd or dvd i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head. very light weight. some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them 'bobble heads'. fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere. cord enters headphones on the left ear side so you don't have to deal with the classic 'y' split cord. easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way. earpices fit nicly over my ears (no pinching gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear) and does a very nice job blocking out noise ( when my wife is awake she watchs the tv rather loudly which is right next to me and i bairly notice it). plenty of padding around the ear pieces. many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear but these headphones i honestly don't feel anything against my ears. even after several hours of use each night. sound quality. bose or pioneer they are not but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn't be shopping in the $20 and under headphones :) that being said they are very good for sound. sounded very good on a portable cd player. only drawbacks i can see is that a person with large/tall ears won't get thier ears covered by the earpads. the inside opening of the earpads is aprox 2 1/4 inchs tall by 1 3/4. imo they could have been made bigger. also if you have a tall head ( good distance from top of head to ear ) you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears. i have a head like drew carry ( give you an idea head size/shape i'm talking about) and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn't have fit. i wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don't interfere bind pinch or anything like that with my glasses. so i highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after( i don't recomend things often :) ) ",positive

" the reviewer below identifying himself as an electronics fan obviously has a deep bias against bose. his multiple reviews about bose products--here and elsewhere--are transparently motivated by some animus against bose. was he fired by bose? did a member of the bose family reject his romantic advances? did a bose executive accidentally run over his cat? did he drop a bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe? the true motivation for this guy's negative reviews would be fun to know. in the meantime what we do know is that he has no credibility and his reviews (two here others elsewhere for other bose products; he's made maligning bose his life's work apparently)) should disregarded. i bought a set of black 301's several years ago to go with my onkyo receiver. we have it hooked up to a television and dvd player for movies. these speakers are in constant use both for the dvd and for music of all types. the room in which they are placed is huge with an 18 foot-high flat ceiling. the speakers saturate the room with exquisite sound day after day. the speakers work fine for spoken audio for dvd's; we can hear dialogue perfectly; i feel no particular need for a surround-sound system. several times my young daughters have turned on the 100 watt amp with the volume turned all the way up or close thereto. i feared a ruptured speaker cone but the 301's are very forgiving no damage has been done. the cats sleep on the speakers; they clean right up and still look new after five years. these speakers keep on giving total satisfaction and i quite simply love them. about three years ago i decided to go all out in another room and bought the highest quality stereo stuff on the market or at least what i determined to be best after a lot of research. this included a set of the gold-series tower speakers from monitor audio. (the speaker cones are metallic with some amount of gold and gold connections etc. etc.) these monitor audios have to be the best looking speakers ever made (real wood veneer cabinetry with the gold cones and the black covers etc.). these speakers cost well over a thousand dollars each. well i must confess as awesome as the monitor audios sound i can't really say they sound any better than the bose 301's!!! they can maybe handle more power but i assure you the bose 301's will play loud enough to bring the cops to your doorstep in five minutes or less. so when i recently set up my third stereo in a bedroom i looked forward to buying a third type of speakers. i ran around and listened to what i could find on display. well after much contemplation i went for a second set of the bose 301's!!! they just couldn't be beat and i would have gladly spent more if i had found something i liked better. but i'm not going to spend more just so i can say i spent a lot...there has to be increased performance. and in my opinion the 301's couldn't be out-performed by any other bookshelf speaker of any price range. my first set of 301's were black. this time i went for the cherry. folks these are absolutely beautiful speakers: almost as cool looking as my monitor audios. the black cover and the black housing fixture in the back really accentuate the cherry colored wood. no it is not real wood but it looks very nice. these things are simply gorgeous. the kind of mod or futuristic shape which bose has designed really stands out in this lighter-colored version. and yes they sound just as good as my original pair. i listen to soft music (jazz typically or ambient) in the morning and these speakers deliver all the nuances at very low volume; i listen to hard rock at high volume on other occasions and the 301's don't scare away or distort at all: these things would tear the house apart before they'd lose sound quality. so yes i recommend these highly. they'd still be the speaker of choice for me at three or four times the price ",positive

" this is the perfect little tv/dvd for a little girl's room! the picture is great and hello kitty pops on screen for certain commands (volume channel change..). my daughter age 4 loves it. i would have given this product 5 stars but there are a couple drawbacks...the remote control is has so many buttons and they are very tiny very close together. i can barely read what each button does because the labels/print is also very tiny. this is annoying when in my daughter's darkened room and i have to turn on a bright light just to find the pause button... the other thing i have to point out that bugs me is that you can't eject/or open the dvd player unless the tv is in dvd mode. in other words when i go to put in a dvd i can't just push open. nothing will happen. you have to find the right button choose dvd from a choice of 3-4 things and only then will the tray slide open. all in all these things would not prevent me from buying this tv again...although it would be nice if they did come out w/ a more kid friendly remote with bigger buttons/symbols for a small child to recognize... one great thing i want to point out--there is fast forward scan that you can watch as it fast forwards (something not all dvd players offer) and this is great when you are putting a dvd in for your child and they want to skip all those pre-movie ads....you can ff right to the beginning of the movie!!!

" our oskar multimedia storage cabinet arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. my husband assembled the unit with ease until it was time to nail the card board backing on. following the instructions he laid the unit down on it's face of course the kick-board had already been added so it didn't lay flat. when nailing on the backing the j board (the center shelf holding the entire unit together) split at every point of contact. we had ordered our oskar storage cabinet through amazon directly from ritz camera. so naturally i called ritz to replace the j shelf. i was informed i would have to return the entire unit. i immediately pictured myself trying to get all those shelves back into the box and figured that was more trouble than i wanted to go through. so i tracked down the number for oskar and called them directly. they were very efficient and helpful. within minutes i had their assurance that they would ship a new j shelf to my home - at no additional charge. the shelf arrived within the promised ten-days. this unit was exactly what we ordered and works well for it's intended purpose. i would caution you to be very careful nailing on the backboard so as not to split the center shelf. my favorite feature of the oskar multimedia wood storage cabinet is that they include plenty of extra shelves unlike so many other brands. i have an entire stack of shelves that i can add as needed. i would love to have three or four more of these units.

" this item is br1500 which also called rs model vs. the bx1500 called xs models. external battery br24bp can be used for both br1500 and bx1500. the capability to connect external battery is great since that can help reduce the downtime when california experiencing rolling black in the summer. there are basically 2 differences between the back-ups rs(br1500) and the back-ups xs (bx1500) models besides their names. 1. the back-ups rs models have both 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem data-line protection and 10/100base-t ethernet protection where as the back-ups xs models only has 1-line 2-wire phone/fax/modem protection. 2. the back-ups rs models have both boost* and trim** as features of automatic voltage regulation (avr) where as the back-ups xs only has boost. when the input voltage increases above the high transfer point of a back-ups xs model it will only go to battery. *avr boost: the ups is compensating for a low utility voltage. while the ups can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the ups the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently low. **avr trim: the ups is compensating for a high utility voltage. while the ups can run in this mode indefinitely without any negative impact on the ups the circuit should be checked by a qualified electrician if the utility voltage is consistently high. bx1500 does not have the avr trim feature when ac line voltage is higher than spec it will switch over the battery power till the line voltage drops into the spec range. please note this is called backup ups not the smart ups line. backup ups does not produce pure sine wave. when power lost it will take some milli-seconds to switch over to battery power. smart-ups produces sine wave and the output ac was from dc source all the time. when ac input lost the ac output will not have any interrupt. for most computers the backup-ups is good enough since the power supply inside pc always have capacitors that can hold for about 100ms or longer. when backup-ups switched over in about 20ms the computer will continue operates without much impact. but for a/v equipment this may be an issue especially the output is not pure sine wave. i would not recommend use this ups for a/v equipment ",positive

" i am so satisfied with this product that i had to come back and write a review on this. it has good picture quality and sound quality is amazing! battery lasts very long which is very very useful n important feature for portable players. i love to watch movies on this and also love to connect this to my tv and watch on a big screen any place i go ",positive
" i did a bunch of research before i bought the a2. the things that sold me on it were : 1. battery life. 2. it's got a voice recorder & encodes direct to mp3 3. i love the fact that it's folder view all my music on my pc is organized by artist then album anyway so it's just copy and paste to get it onto the a2.which leads to................. 4. just copy mp3's & avi's on there like a removable usb drive. 5. a/v out to tv is cool. 6. a/v in to record video is a nice extra. so far it's played every avi i've thrown at it. i've got 15gb of music on there and just let it random play the whole lot i use the a2 mostly when driving. i got a nice fm transmitter that powers off the cig socket sound quality is pretty good. only problem i have is that i have to carry the a2 in the house at night for fear of it getting stolen out of the car ! i also invested in the silicon cover from zcover-it comes with a plastic screen protector and is perfect for when my 2 yr old wants to watch one of his movies on there (the a2 makes for a great pacifier !) mine came with the latest firmware on there so there was no need to upgrade. i'm very happy with the a2 and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for am honest to goodness media player and has no need for subscription services or any other force fed crap.

" works great out of the box. some reviews mentioned problems with the cd but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try. it mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet. no problem with signal strength happy to say since the unit it replaced had problems. the brightness of the digital clock is adjustiable and i use it as a night light in the kitchen. the remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater (magnet) with my wife useing it to hang things. this is a thomson inc product (purchased the ge & rca names several years ago) that makes tv's ect. i am very happy with the product and recommend it ",positive

" i purchased this dehumidifier to tackle my overly-humid house. i live in california but my house is naturally very humid (around 75% on average). the humidity frequently gets up to around 80% and above in the winter as verified with a hygrometer. mold was fast becoming a problem. i have used this dehumidifier for over two weeks now and it is scary how well it works! i placed it in the bedroom were the hummidity was at it's highest and it lowered my 15'x15' room from 75% to 50% in less than three hours! it has a quiet fan that i have no problem sleeping with. the tank is easy to empty and it is light enough to move from room to room. i have not owned any other dehumidifiers before so i have no basis of comparison but i am in love with this one! it was completely worth the price ",positive

" this is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference. but to see the beam (not just the dot at the end of the beam) you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of. using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out. and if you are wondering no matter how bright your laser is without particles in the air you wont see the beam. at concerts where they use the big argon lasers they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of ",positive
" although i prefer the akg k701 for most of my listening this competing entry from beyer is so close that it's almost a coin toss. (one recent comparison in a headphone artcle came up with a dead heat.) this is surprising considering that the dt880 is one of the most reasonably priced of the major mid-priced headphones. the bass is full but nicely textured - not a touch of bass bloat to be found here. the highs are detaied and never seemed sharp to me and the overall sound offers a huge soundstage. instead of the music being on top of your these beyers lend a perceived distance of a few feet; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant and surprisingly makes rock music grandiose in an appealing kind of way. these headphones don't require a headphone amp but certainly profit from one. the 30 ohm version makes for more volume though the 250 ohm version is standard and best for most daily listening. the dt880 sounds great but lacks a tad of the k701's high-end sparkle. conversely beyer's value comfort and workmanship can't help but impress. this is a phone that has labored under the shadow of the akgs and the senn 650s but listeners are always impressed by the dt880s sound. it may be your best value in a mid-priced all-purpose headphone ",positive
" this has a nice size screen. it only has 3 buttons.play pause and stop so if you like a dvd player without alot of pizazz this is it. i was trying to figure out how you picked the different scenes and you had to push the stop button. i just found this out by trial. there was a few times during the dvd that it would turn into digital. this would only last a second or two. at first i thought it was the dvd but its done it on all three of them. the volume control is on the side as well as the power button. it could have a little higher volume but it was sufficient for me ",positive

" this is a great product for a busy professional or grad student who gives their mac a lot of mileage. i'm in law school so i'm constantly throwing my computer in my bag along with heavy casebooks keys and other junk. my old ibook survived tremendous abuse and after two years looked like it had been through a war. the speck case protects the macbook's shell and even the screen in a roundabout way. normally if you put a mac into a briefcase or bag with heavy books the books will press against the shell and the screen inside will press against the keys leaving dents and screwing the the lcd. the speck case is very stiff so even the heaviest books and the worst abuse don't push the screen onto the keyboard. plus if you put a red case on a white mac people will think you're in some secret club that has access to red macs. cons: it's next to impossible to remove the top case with two hands - you need a buddy to get it off. also dust starts to collect under the bottom case (static?) so you need to take off the bottom monthly to clean. fortunately the bottom case is easier to remove for cleaning.

" i've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years. i've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday. i ride a motorcycle everyday and i never leave without these. first the comfort is exceptional. even with my helmet on i never get uncomfortable with these in my ears. i've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems. even when i need a break from the music i leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise. i've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best but most are painful with a helmet on. the bulb you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep. second the sound quality is fantastic. great bass mids and highs. i've heard things in my music i never knew was there and i can't wait to listen more. i can't recommend these enough. i've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine ",positive

" i just purchased a mogo mouse and i'm *amazed* at how usable it is. i was extremely skeptical (and probably wouldn't have bought one) until i was able to try a colleague's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is. the one thing - and it's a pretty big thing - is the lack of scroll-wheel technology. that's a sorely missed feature in this mouse. that said there are always trade-offs but in this case that's the only one. battery life seems great usability is great convenience is great...just add the touch pad and it'll be the mouse for notebook computer users!

" after ruining another pair of over-the-head headphones i decided to check these out. they are actually on sale at 50% off and i've just tried mine out. the audio is very sharp especially with the base though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair i can just increase the volume to compensate. at $35 this is a great deal. they feel great. the band that most headphones have presses down on your head but not too much. it also folds down quite nicely though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress. haven't tried out the actual noise-cancellation feature but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent then it will work just as well. it also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your mp3 player if you so wished. however it easily fits into a jacket pocket. great great great design and comfort ",positive

" i did a lot of research not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later. i was about to buy the newest 40 720p samsung for $1899... then i stumbled upon this one at circuit city for $1999 and bought it on the spot... paid about $50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later. i've had it a week now and i love it. standard-definition picture quality is just okay but are any of us buying these tvs to watch sdtv? i get about 15 hd channels through my cable company including all four major networks plus espn espn2 and a couple music and movie channels. therefore a majority of everything i watch is available in hd anyway. sdtv content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet. hd content looks awesome (including black levels) and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p. i can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available. i'm going to wait another year or two for the high-definition dvd format war to play out before i buy a blu-ray or hd-dvd player. but i've watched standard-definition dvd on my xbox with this tv and the picture is beautiful. i'm sure high-definition dvd would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition dvd on this tv. in short this is an excellent tv especially compared to other 1080p models in its size range. if you're looking for something in the range of $2000-$2200 this is the one you want. enjoy ",positive

" i have been using this mouse at work since it came out. after many miles of use the scroll wheel has finally started to fail. i can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls. the best feature of this mouse is the battery life. a coworker who swears by his logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months but i usually got at least ten months out of mine. i even took to dating the batteries when i installed them just to rub it in. this mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some but overall i would recommend it. going to try a rechargable logitech next time around ",positive

" first off... i like this unit. it's easy to use and it does a fine job of taking your old lps and making cds out of them. all you need to do is place a blank audio cd into the deck (it doesn't work with regular data cds) hit the phono/aux button followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the lp... take it out of pause. it starts recording instantly. between each song hit a button and it break the recording into tracks. pretty cool! it's got great potential but there are still a few shortcomings. for example i was surprised to see that it doesn't let you record off of the radio. just as surprising to me was the fact that the radio tuner wasn't digital. it's a pain in the neck having to fiddle with the dial to tune in to your favorite stations. you turn back and forth over and over like it was a radio from 40 years ago. i wouldn't mind the analog tuner too much if it at least had a handful of presets. this also makes the remote control somewhat useless too. oddly the remote does have an am/fm button. they should just label it the radio button because when you think of it switching from am to fm or vice versa using the remote makes no sense at all because you would need to re-tune the station too using the dial. another key point is that the unit doesn't have any outputs at all. so you can't pipe the output from the turntable into your other systems or use any other speakers. i would rate this as 3.5 stars but since we can't use half stars i'll give it 4 for one big reason.... for all it's shortcomings it works and there are very few alternatives. speaking of alternatives here are a few other options. 1. a standalone cd-recorder. i have one of these too. the advantage of this type of deck is that it fits into your existing system like an old cassette deck. in my case my stand alone unit has two drives so not only can i record from any source in my system but i can dub from one drive to the other. also my deck can make mp3 cds from regular cds (it's easier than using a pc however the song titles are just numbers). in my case i opted not to use this for my lp projects because i no longer have a turntable. i decided that as long as i needed a new turntable i might as well pay a bit more for this unit. 2. crosley makes a simuilar unit but it costs a bit more and the reviews i read seemed to point out that although it looks better the turntable itself was flimsy and it skipped a lot. 3. a portable digital recorder like the ikey plus. i found one of these a few weeks ago and i love it. you plug your turntable or other external source into it... plug a usb storage device into the port tap a button or two to decide the quality (.wav vs several mp3 sampling rates)... viola! it records directly to your flash drive ipod or external hard drive. if you do go that route make sure you get the plus model. the older model is outdated and doesn't work as well. 4. use a pc. even though it will give you the best possible sound and options it's out of the question for me because i do not want to move my pc near my stereo every time i want to make a recording nor do i want to move my stereo next to my pc... or bog it down while i'm trying to use it for that matter. keep in mind that if you record your cds using one of the stand alone decks you can still clean up the hiss and pops by loading the cds you made into a pc afterwards then filtering the files with your favorite audio software then re-burn the files to cd or mp3.

" i had looked at numerous stands for my yamaha keyboard and didn't want to spend a ton of money for a professional grade stand (at professional prices). with that in mind the yamaha pkbx2 double x portable keyboard stand is a good choice at $29.99. i had seen other stands that were not as sturdy (single x stands)and cost about the same price. tips for assembly: - don't read the instructions just look at the enlarged image of the keyboard on amazon and assemble the stand the way it's shown. - the bolts for attaching the arms and legs come screwed in to the stand. use the (included )allen wrench to remove them. pros: - low price. - solid sturdy stand. - works for just about any keyboard. - the stand's height is fully adjustable and can be done in several seconds - without having to unscrew anything. cons: - there is no way to attach a keyboard to this stand. no screws bolts or straps are included even though most (including my yamaha) keyboards have pre-drilled holes for screwing the board to a stand. the keyboard simply sits on top of the stand. i was very disappointed about this. - the included allen wrench did not work for one of the bolts. the bolt came screwed in to the stand way too tightly to be removed using the included tool. the allen wrench only stripped the bolt it did not loosen it. luckily my husband had a better allen wrench of nearly identical size and that one worked. without it we would not have been able to loosen the bolt ",positive

" i just purchased the archos 604 about 3weeks ago. so far so good. it interfaces very easily with the computer. though i have not tried it using windows media 10 yet. i recommend at least buying the archos docking adapter kit (if you do not plan on using the archos to record programs). it allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos. the only negative that i have so far is that the volume at its highlest level is difficult to hear on an airplane. you may need some noise canceling headphones ",positive

" i looked at all the different cases for my new ipod with video and the reviews kept pointing me back to this case. so i bought it. it exceeds my expectations. it's fantastic. my ipod is now completely contained and scratchproof. this helps when down the road i might want to sell it. the screen cover is perfectly clear and seems very durable. i like the fact that it's held off of the ipod's screen so it won't scratch. the clickwheel is easily usable actually more so because of the circle around it. i bought the case on amazon from sonicswap and am astounded at how fast i got it. 2 days! amazing. this case is for the 60gb ipod with video. it clearly says that in the title; not sure how that one reviewer got confused about that. don't hesitate. this is the case ",positive
" i gave my son a garmin 60c for christmas last year. tinkered with it for a couple of days before handing it over. it worked well. of course i wanted one for myself but cash is cash so i've been putting it off. (side note - i wanted to borrow it for a trip this past spring and when they went to get it it had been stolen from their car map-pocket. it seems these are high-theft items; keep'em on a short leash.) my wife hadn't gotten me any big christmas gift so i told her i knew what i wanted and started shopping. i debated between the explorist 500 and 600. chose the 600 with its altimeter and thermometer. probably could have lived without them but hey it's christmas! it came yesterday so i charged it a bit and then it had no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover. i had to go out to the street for the garmin to find satellites. took it out for a spin today. spot-on navigation as i ran errands. it tracked back almost to the exact spot i had marked for home though it had me driving down the wrong side of the street on that portion of my route that was a duplicate - so it's off by a few feet. (maybe it still thinks it's in britain?) now - why only 4 stars? 1) the usb connector can attach to the unit either way. there's no instructions anywhere to say which way it should go. i called the 800 # and spoke with someone (in new delhi) who had heard this a lot. she told me what to do and the pc immediately recognized the gps file system - as a removable disk drive as advertised. i really find their website information near-zero. something as elementary as this should be covered on a website after the 3rd call eh? 2) i bought the mapsend 3d topo software. i am interested in elevations. and it has detailed street maps. but - they're not routable! if you want routable streets (where the unit will route you along streets and not just a crow's flight direct path) for following in a car then either you have to get both map products or choose. it's rather frustrating. and the sales information provided on amazon and the magellan sites does not make this critical lack very clear. it tells you what you can do but not what you can't and there's no product comparison to see what the differences are. on the mapsend topo box it says very clearly navteq roads and streets data - like that found in the most expensive car navigation systems (non-routable). er excuse me then it's not quite like that found in expensive car systems is it? i concur with other reviewers who find the software selection verbiage (on amazon and magellan) more obfuscating than informative. why can't someone create a simple comparison chart for all the various map packages ",positive

" to my eyes the printer's rendition of colors is above average. it isn't horrible but neither is it the best. pricewise it's an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature. we've been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via tray 2 (the default paper supply) and haven't any problems. the manual (electronic file) advises never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels. so it's a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label. a wonderful quality of experience is the near instant on (very minimal warmup) feature and it's quiet. my previous okidata c5300 was a noisemaker and was turned on only just before printing. its time delay was also a disadvantage. i think most people will be very happy with the hp.

" the only thing i will say about the bdp-s1 is that it is top quality. picture and sound quality are top-notch but everything really depends on the software. now if you are undecided about which camp to follow (blu-ray or hd dvd) i'm here to tell you that blu-ray will win. you see i have both blu-ray and hd dvd. i have about 20 hd dvd movies and about 20 blu-ray movies. in terms of picture and sound quality they are the same but it is completely dependant on the software. but here is where the similarities end. 1) blu-ray is more durable. the bd movie discs have scratch-resistant coating. they don't scratch unless you forcefully scratch them. on the other hand the hddvd movies scratch like heck. i put all of my movies in a cd case. i recently noticed that all the hddvd movies are scratched but none of the blu-ray movies are scratched. these are stored in the same cd case by me. i am extremely careful. none of my movies even have a fingerprint on them. so when i see scratches on 100% of my hddvd movies that really upsets me!!!!! 2) blu-ray costs less to buy. what? superman returns bd is $24 superman hddvd is $28. the departed bd is $24 the departed hddvd is $28. now the hddvd dual format has both a standard dvd and hddvd movie but who in their right mind would want to buy an hddvd to watch a 480p picture? right now you can get a $500 ps3 or $400 toshiba hddvd player. later this year sony will come out with a $300 blu-ray disc player. hddvd will most likely drop their prices. so the hardware will cost the same in both formats. 3) blu-ray has more capacity. for less money you can get a 50gb blu-ray movie versus a 30gb hddvd movie. and what if in 5 years they develope super high-definition 1920p picture and super hi-def 8.1 dts-hd sound? what if this requires 75gb or 100gb? hddvd can go up to 51gb. peace.

" i agree with the comments posted here. like most of us i was interested in the bose sound yet put off by the prestige price. even on e-bay the going price ended up being around $400 -- for a used older model. so i did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison-shopper article that put the bose up against several competitors including this high-end teac. i have to say that i'm entirely satisfied. the chrome retro look is quite appealing and the model has a couple of features that for me beat out bose entirely. i wanted a top-loading door like the old bose models but also the ability to play mp3 like the new ones and this gave me both. the sound and punch is remarkable. at flat setting it is a bit bassy that's true but you get a -5 to+ 5 range for both bass and treble adjustment: i set mine at -3 and +1 respectively and am very happy with the sound in my bedroom. input and alarm functions are limited but not problematic. 10 presets can be cycled though quickly enough and just remember to set it to a station (or load a cd) that you'd want to be woken up to before calling it a night! teac customer service i can't comment on but i bought a reconditioned unit from an amazon seller for less than $100 including shipping. a sweet deal for a sweet machine.

" i didn't want to fork over 500 for a bose or boston acoustics or even 350 for a cambridge soundworks and then i found this little gem for about 175 + shipping. i've had it for a few days and so far i am impressed. the sx functions are very intuitive easy to set the time and both alarms. i thought it was extremely innovative to have the button that sets the time located inside the cd player compartment no more accidentally changing the time instead of the alarm! the alarm buttons themselves will illuminate when they are activated which is great. the buttons themselves have a nice click when you press them and the cd am/fm tuner and aux buttons will glow when they are active. the volume control and tuner knobs are recessed but this keeps the player from having any unsightly bulges i suppose. the snooze/sleep button is a good size. the sleep function can be toggled for 90 60 or 30 minutes. the range of the speakers is great when you consider the size of the sx. the speakers measure about 2.5 inches and with the volume turned up you can definitely feel the air being pushed out of the bottom of the unit. i like that it has adjustable bass and treble which can vary from -5 to +5. i have the bass set to +3 and treble to +2 and it sounds great. it doesn't have the range of say a home entertainment system but definitely rivals my sony bookshelf system. the mp3 player on the sx could be better but is adequate. during playback the lcd will scroll to display the filename title artist and track. it can be programmed for up to 64 tracks but i haven't had the time or patience for this. instead i just numbered the mp3 tracks in the order i wanted before burning them to the cd-rom. the repeat function works well and you can choose either to repeat one track repeat all tracks or repeat just one folder. however the shuffle function is rather limited as it has only one setting which is to randomly play an mp3 from any of the folders (resulting in less than desired combinations of music) and it stop playing music after each song from all the folders has been played once. one of the things i looked for in a clock radio is an auxilliary input mini-jack and it also has a jack for headphones. i have my laptop on my nightstand right now and it playing mp3s on winamp sound great plugged into the sx. there are only 2 levels of brightness for the backlit lcd. the default level cannot be changed or dimmed and is rather bright in a dark room.. it will make everything glow. takes a little while to get used to but is not say brighter than a typical nightlight i guess. it is a bit hard to read at night because the numbers are so small and the brightness of the lcd can kind of drown out the analog display but then again i wear glasses so i suppose i have nothing to blame besides my bad eyes. when the radio or cd player is in operation the dial becomes significantly brighter but it can be toggled to the lower/default level with the dimmer button on the remote control. one other thing about the unit was the lack of a battery backup and you will notice this is the case with many japanese units including the sony clock radios. i guess the power grid in japan is really stable so they don't have use for this but still it would be nice if there was an option for a backup 9 volt battery. on the other hand i was informed by teac tech support that the unit does contain a capcitor which will retain the time and alarm for up to 3 hours. i haven't had the time to test the maximum threshold but i can say that i did unplug the clock for about a minute and when i plugged it back in sure enough the time and alarms were still correct. overall i am really impressed by this unit. the only thing that could be better is if the mp3 player shuffle had a few more options but i guess this is ok as many i have seen mp3 clock radios without any shuffle function at all! also i wish the lcd backlight could be adjusted a little more. it is a bit pricey at just under 200 but i have heard many clock radios and you would have to spend 350+++ to get anywhere near the sound quality of the teac sx ",positive

" i use my lx4 2.1 system as my desktop pc speakers. i got this recommendation from maximum pc since the lx4 5.1 system was 2005's best speaker system. you can view their gear of the year review here: http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/12/m-audio_studiop_1.html. being skeptical of a $550 5.1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite i wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2.1 system. as soon as i purchased cables (fyi: no 1/8 stereo to two 1/4 mono cables seem to exists -as far as i've seen-- so you have to use adaptors) i was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the speakers. i wasn't used to speakers with crossovers where only the each type of speaker (tweeter woofer and sub) gets the right frequencies so no overlapping exists. all the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient while the speakers themselves are of superb build quality. after only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound-intensive games i immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5.1 expander setup. if you are looking for speakers that play really loud or can fill a living room with the desired feel for an action movie these are not for you. but if you want incredibly accurate pc speakers or relatively cheap studio monitors this is definitely the setup for you. you will not be disappointed if you buy the lx4 for your bedroom or for computer use ",positive

" we now have three of the k850 printers in use one with a built in print server second paper tray and duplexer. so far the printers have proved to be reliable fast and comparatively inexpensive to operate. power on pre-print and post-print noise may be objectionable to users who are located close to the printer. capable of using the same hp 10 black and hp 11 individual color ink cartridges as well as replacement print heads as the hp business ink jet 1100d and hp business ink jet 1200d the k850 shares the same low per page operating cost as the 1100d and 1200d printers. full page color photographs print in roughly 32 seconds with a roughly eight second delay prior to the start of printing; similar prints from other printers may require from one to five minutes to print the same full page color photograph. white horizontal lines were present in the full page color photograph possibly indicating that one or two of the nozzles in the print heads shipped with the new printer are defective. the printer handles paper sizes up to 13 x 19 so it easily handles b size (tabloid 11 x 17) paper commonly used for small engineering prints and foldable newsletters. the printer software installs without problem although a reboot will likely be required. for network capable k850 printers the software install automatically finds k850 printers on the network and adds a hp standard tcp/ip port to the computer configuration for communication with the printer. for non-network capable k850 printers both usb and parallel port connections are supported. positives: * uses ink that is compatible with other printer models helping to keep operating costs down. * fast printing for full page color and even faster black printing with spot color. * large format color printing which is helpful for quick generation of engineering prints. * nearly idiot proof print cartridge replacement - light turns on to indicate the color that needs to be replaced printing stops automatically user replaces ink cartridge and printing continues. * separate ink cartridges and print heads means less aligning of print cartridges/heads after ink cartridge replacement larger capacity ink cartridges and lower operating cost. negatives: * minimal install of hp software from the cd requires at least 100mb. * low capacity hp 13 print cartridges ship with the printer. * power-on pre-print and post-print noise just like the business ink jet 1100d and 1200d. however there is very little noise produced while printing. * cheap plastic cover over the print cartridges similar to that used on the 1200d. * large footprint ",positive

" i bought this mount for a philips 42 plasma tv. the tv weighs probably about 100lbs. i thought the price for it was ok but i don't know how much an average mount would cost and think the price i paid was pretty good compared to some other mounts. the mount was put on our living room wall by a handy man because i didn't have a stud finder. he was able to to put the mount on the wall very easily and the assembly was pretty basic. the mount sits very well secured and the frame of the mount is very durable and strong which leaves me with a good sense that my investment is properly secured. the 5o tilt function is very nice to have and is being used so the tv sits a little high but is aimed perfectly and adds a nice presentation to the house. the room for the input cables is a little small and causes some cables to be bend a little close to the connector than i would like to see but haven't noticed any degradation in the signal. none of the cables so far look damaged and will remain that way so its not of a concern. i took the cables and made a 1 trunk of cables with the power cable and all and video inputs and it seamlessly hangs down the middle to a cabinet with all the accessories. the tv sits very close to the wall which was a key characteristic of the project even with the 5o tilt. i rate this item with 5 stars because it is very well made and very strong. it also looks nice and stays well hidden. its features with the 5o tilt work great and the locking bar makes removing the tv easy(i had to take it off the wall to trunk the cables). i am very very happy with it and would definitely recommend this product ",positive
" i bought this product to hang a 42 lcd. i am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns. the mount is only 32 wide. the virtual axis tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a 5 degree tilt which working perfect for me. there are only two tilt options with this mount vertical (hugs wall nicely) and the 5 degree. being 32 wide you will not hit 3 studs if they are 16 centers. make sure you get at least 2 studs. my experience is this mount does not support vesa 400x800mm pattern. 800mm is ~31.5 inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than ~30 apart. my tv did have another attaching pattern but i had to use the m5 bolts (provided with mount). i would feel safer if this mount did support the 800 spacing where i could use the thicker m8 bolts. a 42 lcd isn't going to weigh as much as a 50+ tv so take that into consideration. i am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy.

" this is absolutely the best mp3 i have ever owned. what makes it the best? 1. 16 million color 2.5 lcd touchscreen. 2. battery life is too good to be true. 52 hours audio 10hr video. 3. the best sound it has how much tweaks its sick. you can slowdown a song or make it sound like the chipmunks. has bbewide stereo enhancement stereo etc. 4. the volume is sooo dam loud. i had a zune and the volume level was at 20 the lourdest it could go. the d2 level is 50 and at 30 it sounds as high as the zune. 5. you can encode avi video bitrate at 1.5mbps.also have wmv which you can encode at 768kbps. 6. no need to install to transfer files it works like a usb flash drive. 7. you can change backgrounds and if you put a black background and your text is black you can change the text color to 20 difference colors or make you own. 8. the touchscreen is smooth and flawless. when playing music it tells you the info of the file. example bitrate info hz etc. something that is lacking on the big boys. 9. has tv output also has a recorder to record conversations. 10. can view .txt files. 11. can view pics at very high pixels. 12. fm tuner you can record from the fm radio. you can set the bitrate from low to 256kbps. 13. has a sd slot for more storage. get a 8 gig sd for a total for 12 gig. imagine in 2 years when they have 20 gig sd. 14. great support firmware updates are always available. plus sooo much more ",positive
" this particular cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it it will blow you away. i've heard people complain about dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support autually their tech support sucks but i don't need them. this is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully. when you actually learn how to use it you won't buy anything else for the price. if you are tech savey you will really enjoy the product. i have nine cams installed at three locations. using their ip software you can view upto 16 at once. the reason i'm back on this site is because i need to order two more. i did have to return my first one but it was a pre-production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear. dlink sent my replacement direct. the oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now. one last comment the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50% more with less features ",positive
" i like this printer. there a few minor quarks but it's fast and the prints come out good. the one thing to watch for is making sure the ink tape cartridge stays tight. if it's lose it will start making bad prints. it takes less than minute to pull the cartridge out tighten it and start printing again. i am also using this with the mac osx os. though the device says it will only work with pc and mentions something about the casio cw utility for use on a mac but no where on the casio site could i find the mentioned utility. after some searching i cam e accross this: [...] this allows the cw-100 to work fine on a mac. though i have never seen the pc software that comes with printer i have read that this mac version does not have all of the text formating options. this is enough to get around since you can make a jpg version of your label put that in the print area and print away. the jpg can be what ever image/text you want. resolution is great too. i print at 300dpi. all in all i found this to be a great purchase. i make music and do not have the money to send out to have my cds done. this print has more than paid for itself by allowing me to make professional looking cds and very little cost. great the diyer ",positive
" if you're an anti-commercial radio type this tuner will probably not win you over. if however you don't like paying a monthly charge for satellite radio and you want something more than just standard am/fm you might like this tuner. many stations in the top 50 cities have stations transmitting hd signals. the quality of hd is most amazing on quiet passages in classical music there is no noise at all very quiet. you do notice! the hdt-1 is quite sensitive. it will pull in stations that other tuners won't and i'm not even talking about the hd2 streams that the stations are starting to feature. clear channel for all the bashing people do of them is doing a great job with hd. their stations sound good and most of the fm's are doing hd2 a few have some interesting formats not heard on most am/fm stations. i hope the get even more adventurous. my only disappointment is you need a strong signal to get hd to lock in on am or fm. i don't believe that to be a fault of the tuner it's the hd system and just like fm did i'm sure it will improve (ask someone over 50 about fm drift) . i give it 5 stars it's not perfect but for the price it's very good and for a first generation product i don't think it could be better than this ",positive

" i must admit the first review posted here on the d320 made me a little nervous. my experience is quite different and after several months of ownership i am quite pleased. i'll give a point by point rebuttle to the initial review as that's the only point of reference (so far): 1) yes pick up a usb cable 2) printer driver installation on win98 essentially required no user intervention. with winxp however i do seem to recall having to muck with it more but i'm hazy on the details now 3) i have printed scores of multi-page documents many over 15 pages without any problems whatsoever. i've had no spills or jams of any kind 4) i have not seen any paper-curl problems whatsoever 5) i leave the paper cassette lid/manual-feed slot in place at all times as i have no problem with it. for doing many two-sided copies it is indeed easier to place the copies back into the paper cassette. but that's my experience with any copier i've used. 6) making two-sided copies is easy and as efficient as i expected. i've simply experienced no problems. 7) i've experienced no copier caused misalignments. if my copies have been crooked it was because i set them on the glass improperly. i am very happy with this unit. it copies as i expect it to and prints just the same: quickly and without event. it's been able to properly print from all windoze applications i've thrown at it and ones many users may not even be using such as ghostscript acrobat securecrt paf and all image viewing software i've tried. and i've got several machines networked together (win98 and winxp) that can all print to the d320 fine using printer sharing. btw the d320 comes with a full 3500 page toner cartridge too not a starter unit as with some printers/copiers ",positive
" i struggled between this and the shure e2c. i decided on the e2c after comparing also with the etymotics r6i and the ultimate ears superfi3. this one has the least clarity but wonderful bass. if i don't listen to as much classical music i'd definitely pick vmoda vibe. it makes even terrible pop songs sound cool. i had to reject it because wearing it was not comfortable for my left ear at all for some reason and i had an extremely hard time putting it in even with the help of my bf. the vmoda did not come with any foam only the silicon ear pieces. i settled on the less bass but more clarity and more comfortable e2c ",positive

" this is my second set of garmin radios. i have had the 120's for a couple years now and had to try out the new 530's. first of all i really like the new color screen and the added features. the altimeter has been upgraded over the 120's and seems to be more accurate. my old 120's sitting right next to each other would display different altitudes. i would not use the data to survey a site but it is more accurate than the older models. we do a quite a bit of skiing an the altitude displays are helpful when your on the lifts or trying to figure out how many vertical feet you have skied. especially if your using different lifts and not going all the way to the top. the new compass is also helpful. with the older models you would have to be moving for the compass to work right. after calibrating the new compass (turning in a circle) it will work just like a regular compass. i still carry a regular one in my pack while hiking as a backup but the compass on the 530 works great and has not let me down. you can also route off the compass by lining up the sites on the 530 with where you want to go. the 530 will then guide you there and keep you on track if bush whacking and can't see your next way point. as with all the rino radios the microphone is a little on the weak side. i really think it's because of the waterproofing that they do. if you don't put it close to your mouth when speaking it's really not that bad. i did pick up a pair of throat mics and they have solved any problems at all with clear communications. lock up problem. i have experienced this once or twice the first time i used them. i did the garmin update and have not had the problem since. overall these new 530's are great. i have been using them for close to 2 months every weekend and sometimes during the week. now that i have 4 of these (2 120's and 2 530's) these things are a blast to have when we are with a group. looking forward to the ski slopes this winter. we always seem to get separated at some point and never find each other for hours. if you do a lot of outdoor activities or any geocaching with more than one person these are perfect!!

" i had researched for a long time before i finally made my purchase. the final reasons for this purchase was the consumer reports best buy recommendation for the larger 42 version of this olevia set. i had debated about purchasing a tv with 1080 but decided against doing so when i read that in a set this size that the naked eye could not tell the difference between 1080 and 720. i needed the 37 set due to the entertainment center we already owned which cost 2.5 times the price of the tv so it wasn't leaving the house. the tv opening would have allowed a 40 but i am glad i stayed with the 37 because the set-up would have been difficult if not impossible with a 40 because of the need to turn the set at angles. i compared the two tvs at the olevia site and the only difference was the speakers. i also saw the olevia at a friend's house and was impressed with the quality. the best price was found through amazon.com. i placed my order on a friday evening and the set was delivered by ups in perfect condition on wednesday. the set-up of the tv was simple. the only problem i experienced was with the remote. here's the good news: i sent an email to tech support and quickly i had an answer that was simple to follow and the remote worked perfectly the same evening that i set-up the tv. even though i use the surround sound through our stereo i actually was satisfied with the sound through the tv speakers. a small problem is that the time warner cable box remote control does not operate the tv so we do have to use multiple remotes but that's only a minor inconvenience. our family has been very pleased with the tv. i would highly recommend this tv to anyone purchasing this size tv.

" i purchased this item on march 15 from amazon. we've been using it for almost a month now. my wife and i have built our ht system in our master bedroom (16x14x10) also have 40 samsung lcd 4095 (1080p) and polk audio speakers (in ceiling) lc60i for front and middle speakers and rc60i for the surround speakers. i'm awaiting for toshiba hd-xa2 that was recently ordered to complement our system and would be replacing my current infinity subwoofer with a hsu stf-2 sub. originally my first choice was a pioneer vsx-1016 receiver but with lack of zone 2 and hdmi video pass-thru only. i didn't think it fit our needs. however onkyo tx-sr604b not only was a true bargain but it also exceeded my expectations ease of use (very easy setup) user friendly powerful enough to drive all my polk speakers clean and crisp sound. i did'nt have any problem as far as clicking sound related to hdmi issues like few folks have mentioned on their reviews and i didn't mind running extra component cable to my tv knowing it doesn't up-convert component to hdmi. the only thing that i haven't tested it yet was the zone 2 feature. i'm planning to install my extra pair rc60i in wall speakers to our master bathroom hopefully soon so can't comment on that part yet. overall we're very pleased with our purchased thanks amazon!

" i had an optoma h27 but felt it was lacking the brightness i liked on tv and i heard that hd72 was much better. so i returned my h27 to costco and got the hd6800 which is costco's version of the hd72. wow much better hardly describes it! the brightness is incredible and the detail and colors are truly remarkable. the other night i was trying out different dvds just to see what they looked like on the new system and i was totally blown away. while it does upscale dvd images to look better on its system i also bought a sony upscaling dvd player and there is a significant improvement with it with the hdmi connection. i had read that since they are both upscaling the dvd player's upscaling wouldn't be necessary but i do find the image through the upscaling dvd the best in a side-by-side test using two sony dvd players and two dvds of the recently restored carousel using component s-video and hdmi at the same time all connected to the hd72. i saw clearer detail on faces coming from the hdmi upscaling dvd player. i was so impressed i felt like pulling in people from the street to see it but i fought the impulse because i don't want to share it with anyone. with a little tweaking of the menus new films like star wars iii and sin city showed incredible detail and older films like the adventures of robin hood were gorgeous in their technicolor glory. i highly recommend the hd72.

" when i got my hands on the pmc-120 i thought this was going to to be the best player but when i started to play with it all the glitches started to come into my way. i agree with the other reviews that it has a first generation-device feel to it. music: when i tried to put music in my pmc it syncronized my mp3s with the wmp 10 with no problem (very fast). if u are looking for a grab and drop (copy/paste) your music mp3 device this is not for you because when i did it got everything in one same folder that read unknown artist and album. so you have to put all your mp3s via wmp 10 wich is no problem for me because it does it very fast. the problems that i encountered is that it only has one portable playlist and sometimes when im playing an mp3 and navegating through the other albums the controls respond 1 to 2 seconds later after pushing the button. one cool thing is that it shows the cd covers without having to put them in. this is done via the wmp10. the sound is very good and crisp and the equalizer setups are fair.but you defenetly cant tell the difference between the diffrent eq setups with the built in speacker wich has a very small horrible sound. pictures: this is basically a grab and drop procedure to get your pics in the device and you can arrenge them in folders or subfolders. you can not transfer directly from your camera so if you are travelling and dont have a pc to transfer your pics this little baby wont do that job for you. video: ok now this is where it starts to get frustrating for me... i wanted a portable media device that i would only grab and drop my movies that are divx and xvid. i knew that this device only reads wmv but it supports divx xvid mpeg etc. this support deppends on what the wmp10 can play. so this means that you sincronyze (via wmp10) your movies no matter the format and it converts them into wmp movies and at the same time it just transferes it and fits it into your pmc secreen size. i had this in mind when i bought it and was fine with me untill i tried it the first time: the wmp10 wouldnt convert my xvid movies and after a few hours of trial and error and surfing the web my problem was that i had to have the correct video codecs that are compatibles with the wmp10. so after uninstalling and installing i was good to go so i converted a 1:45hr long movie in only 25 minutes. but this short moment of joy was suddenly interrupted by the fact that the wmp10 fits the widescreen movies into the pmc and makes all the images long and thin almost unwatchable!!!! you cant change this because the wmp does this automatically. my answer was using other software and converting my widescreen movies into wmv files. the problem is that it takes almost the running time of the movies to convert...i have tried a lot of different softwares and still havent found one that does it faster as the wmp10. in the other hand if you have a full screen video you just use the wmp10 and it does it very fast and with good quality. you can connect your device to the tv but the resolution is very low so i think this option is useless on the pmc. so the veredict is: the pmc-120 is a good multimedia player with minor glitches. it is a little bulky but personally i think the size is not that big. i think the good side of the size issue comes along with its big 3.6 inch screen wich is great to watch films and this for me kicks arse compared to the ipod video. if you want to play directly your divx or xvid movies on your player buy another porduct like the iriver pmp series or the archos players wich are way way way more expensive. so i think that for the price and for what it does the pmc-120 gets two thumbs up.

" i muchly recommend suggest buying purchasing these batteries power sources in the pre-tried used section. you can save pay less for them these that way. but be warned aware used pre-tried batteries is may be no good since they is not may be rechargedable ",positive
" all electronics should work this easily. you hook it up read the manual play with it alittle bit and it works like a charm. i've been using two (home desk and car player) for 5 years now. they just seem to last forever ",positive
" this watch is great because the countdown is so easy to use. whenever i need to remember to check the dryer or the stove all i have to do is push one button to the number of minutes i want to wait. its the only watch i wear and i never take it off. i even swim with it on. the only reason i didn't give it five stars is because it is so plain. i wish casio would make it in a pretty color ",positive
" great product that works exactly as described. i have not used this as a stand-alone label maker; i've only used it with my computer. the software is fairly easy to use and it will pull data from an excel spreadsheet which is a definite plus. i had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which i needed to make labels and linking to the excel doc made the process very quick and convenient. the only complaint i have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey. i spent $40 on the label maker and so far i've spent $60 on tape ",positive
" the lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease. product is easy to use and understand. for the money a great purchase. ",positive
" i purchased this as a gift for my 56-year-old mother who simply can't get enough scrabble with her friends. while i did not get the opportunity to use the product myself she seems quite enthusiastic about its abilities. just make sure your opponents approve and dont think you are trying to cheat. ",positive
" i have multiple cameras and one of my favorite features is that this reader can support multiple types of cards plugged in at one time. if you have a sd card and a cf card both can be inserted and read/written to without having to switch out the cards. very nice reader for a great price. the blue led is very pleasant to look at. ",positive
" i would give this 5 stars but for a few things: - the included earbuds are uncomfortable and fall out of my ears during exercise - syncing is sometimes buggy - you have to load all podcasts manually - podcasts seem to be ordered by date on the player no matter how you arrange them in itunes recent releases of itunes have solved some but not all of the sync issues. also i have read about some workarounds for the podcast ordering problem but they involve rebuilding your library and furthermore from what i've read they're just temporary fixes. apple needs to fix this. still the small form factor cool design and easy-to-use controls make this a great product. i sold my 4g 40gb ipod right after i got this and i have no regrets. ",positive
" this card is significantly cheaper (at the time i ordered) than the sandisk extreme iii at the same speed (133x). i was expecting to receive a 100x since it was listed as that in the description but the 133x came and i was very happy. works as advertised and kingston is a reliable memory brand. product came quickly ",positive
" outstanding cleaner for your cd or cdrw mp3 player. takes you through many diagnostic tests. even has a dolby test. well worth the money and you will be more than pleased with it. i used it on both my pc cd and cdrw drives as well as my stereo cd player. fantastic product!! ",positive
" the design for this headset is ingenious. every piece is separated so you can mix and match for your convenience. it's not really a headset but a headphone with a detachable headset; so you can use it to chat online or listen to your mp3 player. the microphone can even be mounted independently onto your computer monitor with the included base. the extension cord comes with a volume controller another very convenient feature. there are also little hangers on the extension cord which are for attaching the microphone cord. the audio quality is pretty good throw in 20 bucks more to get the combo set which includes a sound card to enhance the audio quality. ****the only thing i have to complain about is the comfort issue. maybe it's the size of my head but the earpieces simply press a little bit too hard against my temples so it causes mild headache after 30 minutes of usage. other than that this headset is perfect ",positive
" i'm so technically challenged and i had no trouble figuring out this system. i already had the base unit and had to search for these handsets to go with it. altogether they were a bit pricey but worth every penny! very easy to understand the directions and lots of bells and whistles. lots of cool ring tones and features that are not listed on the product description. i love the intercom features they are great for when the kids are upstairs i don't have to yell for them to come down or go upstairs to talk to them. very cool ",positive
" i couldn't believe how lightweight this monitor is and how easy it was to connect to my computer. it is one of the best investments i have made this year. what a difference the lcd screen makes for my vision. its wonderful. i highly recommend this monitor to anyone who is looking for something easy to connect and have excellent quality as well. it is the perfect monitor for me ",positive
" this watch is not only the best watch i have ever owned it is the only day time watch that i ever use. i love the 1351020 30 minute timer found only on this watch. i love it so much that i buy several and change out the band to match different outfits! i do wish that this watch came in a more dressy version. i also hope that casio continues to make this watch for people who need a timer and a dependable alarm ",positive
" i bought this deck about 6 months ago. it has performed flawless in every aspect. as soon as i turned it on i could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck. i have taken all of my cd's out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface. the ipod function is flawless and easy to use. just plug in your ipod and search by artist album song title or playlist. this can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so i would suggest using playlists. the output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing. also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment. this deck is the best overall i have ever listened to ",positive
" i've had this printer for four years. i print approximately 25 documents each week. this is the first time that i have had to replace the cartridge. it's a great little printer and this cartridge lasts a good long time too. compared to ink jet printers that i have had i get about 5 times as many prints from this laserjet -- and the price of the cartridges is about the same as the ink jets. great buy ",positive
" firstoff that first review about the format capacities is outright wrong. let me explain how this works. the soundstage program that the player uses is a lot like itunes; it has its own proprietary format that is really just mp3 with a different file extension title. when you import your mp3s into the soundstage library it makes its own duplicate library of your music in a new directory using its 'omg' file suffix. yes omg. i think that's funny and you should too. the minidiscs themselves are essentially just cd-rws. keep this in mind. they are enjoyable cheap to buy more they are rewritable and they hold 80 minutes of basic cd-audio or close to 4/5 hours of 'low bitrate' audio which is just compressed mp3s. the product itself is very good. i've had one for a short while. i bought an eight-pack of disks right after i got it and filled them with music. i have six full discs of labeled artists and find that disc-swapping of five-hour playlists is far less irritating than my old cd-player method; cd-swapping with 70-minute albums. the controls are very simple and effective. grouping your tracks makes them easier to navigate but you can otherwise go through all the tracks you have as if it were an audio-cd. its impeccably shockproof and my only severe grievance is the lack of a backlight. the hold switch works fine and the unit is small and light. i got this as an alternative to harddrive mp3 jukeboxes. most mp3 players over a gig in capacity are hd storage which is far less durable (in my experience) than simpler players. rather than settle for a 256 or 512 mb player that i would have to swap on my computer constantly i got the minidisc player and can simply take other disks with me. its a solution that suited me well ",positive
" i've owned 2 sets of these types of phone systems. a ge set and a 2.4 gig uniden set. this is by far the best. actually it's perfect. no noise on the line at all. everything just works perfectly. only one caution. this particular model does not have an answering machine. i was moving too fast when i bought and thought that it did. if you want an answering machine to come with make sure you buy the right model. i'm totally sold on the dect 6.0!!!! buy it. you won't regret it. ",positive
" very nice player. hdmi works perfectly and the 6 disc changer is handy. blue light lets you see the disc's and looks very cool. 1080i with upscaling on all my dvds. ",positive
" i recently bought and installed this radio in my truck and i have not had any problems yet!!! a few minor details are the noise blanker seems really sesitive (sometimes when it is on i do not receive any traffic) but that is about it. i enjoy cobra products this is my second radio (i just traded up from a 25nwxt) i have a cobra hg2000 antenna and i am waiting on a cobra mic for my radio. so far no problems with any of it and i hope to have none down the road!!!! ",positive
" i've had my cobra 29 for over five years now. it's been in four different trucks and traveled over 500000 miles with me. once i added two wilson antennas and a power mic i can get out over four miles on a good night. my personal record is a line of sight 130 miles from a mountainside. i love it. i was thinking of getting a galaxy but why? i have a great radio here ",positive
" after doing some research and owning a cheaper shredder model i decided to purchase this shredder. so far it was a wise decision. i have seen it elsewhere for a lot more money. i have been using it to shred up all my old and new personal documents and it is awesome. i put a kitchen garbage bag in the can and it keeps all the little paper pieces contained within the bag and i can just keep reusing the same bag. it really is a smooth shredder and it keeps on working no jams etc. great buy! ",positive
" there is just one word to describe this product: amazing. i'm full satisfied with it. just buy it with 1mbytes (mine is 512kbytes). one last thing: the battery lasts forever ",positive
" i went from the first version of the audigy2 to this. and it did increase my performace a tiny bit. my old card was going out on me. a lot of pops and clicks and games locking up with sound skipping. haven't had any of that yet. :) i also didn't seem to have the mb problems that were stated in first review. i have a asrock dual-vsta(new one made for windows:vista). with a good stereo setup this card sounds really nice. i have a older but really nice 5.1 with 100watts for each speaker. only 4 years old but have seen some really nice ones lately. a lot of new games coming out have intense sound now. vanguards sound has crappy options so you can't dumb it down and it can drag a system down esp one using on board sound. i would give this a 4 or even 3 star rating if it included amazons rating too. [... ",positive
" fantastic sound for the money! (seems to work well with asus p5w dh anyway) nice crisp highs decent mid-range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick imo. the only down-side i could find is some of the nonsense-software included is well nonsense. creative scores again ",positive
" buying an equalizer seems kind of retro these days but i still have a good cassette dual deck and have recently purchased a reel to reel again.used to have one years ago...now use both of these for fun and the occassional uploading of music from the old formats to my media center computer.the equalizer acts as a hook up device to have both decks on my stereo which is then hooked to my computer.it allows for some sound enhancing along with the computer ",positive
" i use this scanner primarily for text documents and couldn't be more impressed. you do need text software - i have textbridge - but i find relatively few errors in the scan proofreading and corrections are easy and efficient. best of all i don't have another device plugged into my computer or taking up space on my desk. caution - i haven't used it for photos but it does a great job on text ",positive
" this mouse has never let me down. really works on most of the surfaces ",positive
