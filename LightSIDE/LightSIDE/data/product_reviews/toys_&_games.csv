" this wasn't actually a card game. it was more of a book of 88 tear out sheets with one game each. they is no way that this can be played as a card game. the box doesn't even indicate that it's a card game. i thought this would be a fun card game for my husband & daughter to play together. you can purchase magazines with more games for less price. i wouldn't recommend this product unless you would like an overpriced book of sudoku games. i'm returning it & buying an electronic version for husbands pda. the price is about the same.

" i bought this for my 2 yr old daughter. i was so surprised at the quality for little tykes. it has no storage and the refridgerator door would not stay closed. i think it should cost half of what it does. i purchased the step two kitchen when my daughter was three and it is way better by far ",negative
" i bought this for my 5 year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it. within a few days of careful use one of the latches bent a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued. it is a great idea but needs better construction. on a positive note my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if i let her. however i had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before i can fix it. the drawers work fine. the problem is with the two doors on top that flip out. note about drawers; little plastic door knobs pop out. need to be glued in.

" my daughter has an earlier version that the one shown so it is possible they have addressed some of these issues: 1) most games have a 1 minute time out which is really frustrating for my kids 2) oh that's not so good - if i hear barbie say that one more time i may just throw this thing out the nearest window. my daughter will get a score in a game she feels really good about and barbie says oh that's not so good but you'll be better with a bit more practice this has broken my daughter down into tears more than once. 3) there are no parental controls. i wanted to turn off or lengthen the timer. i expected those sorts of features from oregon scientific. right now the most fun thing my kids do with it is play the flower fun game (like hangman) and type in icup if you are looking at a newer version of this i would strongly recommend playing with a demo for a few minutes to check it out ",negative
" my daughter received this as a gift & we all found it extremely difficult to use. i was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out & doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out. it was not at all easy for a child to enjoy. there were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand & play. it is too advanced & difficult to use for the ages listed. the screen on the monitor was low graphics & poor lighting quality as well. this is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter ",negative

" this looks like such a great toy and the packaging is really impressive but don't be fooled like we were. i assumed that by paying close to 25 dollars it would be somewhat durable-just reasonable durability-i don't expect much from plastic toys...but this is really really bad. you might also think that paying that much would give you things like closable doors...you know 99 cent matchbox cars' doors stay closed but the space shuttle's doors don't-which limit it's fun factor. the movable arm is just a free floating plastic stick that simply is stuck into a hole..it doesn't even stay in. the launch pad and the fuel tank/boosters are down right horrible. they don't connect to the shuttle which was disapointed all of us especially my son. and it is so cheaply made i really can't believe that it wasn't bought from the dollar store. my son was so excited for this set. but after playing with it for just a few minutes he hasn't gotten it out again. i would definately not recommend this ",negative

" i bought this for my daughter for her 11th birthday. after playing the game once she asked me if i could take it back. she said that the game was boring because it was so limited as far as what you could do in the game. my daughter has always played a lot of simulated life video games (i.e. the sims animal crossing) and online games (i.e club penguin). i suspect this is why she found this game limiting. other games that she has played portray a more intricate life and therefore draw the player in to a greater degree. my advice would be to consider what your daughter is used to before buying this. if your daughter has no experience in these types of games this game will probably be fine. however if your daughter has previously played simulated life games she will probably find this one lacking.

" i bought this game for my new family for christmas. this is not at all the game of life that i remember playing for countless hours as a child. first of all my old game had all of the mountains houses and spinner permenantly attached to the game board. with the new version all of these things have to be attached with each setup which takes about 10-15 minutes and they are easily knocked off the board. also the spinner is hard to spin and frequently comes off of its pivot. the cars are less sturdy and the people pegs do not stay in the car so you are constantly having to put the people back in the car. finally the rules of the game have gotten more complicated and yet the meaning of the game has become more trivial. i think i will put this in the top of a closet or in a yard sale and go find my old version of the game to play in the future ",negative

" bought this for daughter for christmas and when i opened the box and saw the cardboard backing debated on returning it. but they love the pegasus barbies so figured okay let's try it out! is really beautiful when all put together and my daughter loves it! but that stupid cardboard backing. nope no way does it stay on at all. am going to tape it to the wall behind the playset and it will be fine. right now is just standing up behind the set. really couldn't they have made a plastic piece with a big sticker with clouds/pegasus horses on it that attached to the back? when assembled the whole thing will fall apart if you literally move it a couple inches. my 3-year old daughter understands this not to move it and so far she has been fine with it. i showed her myself moving it and it falling apart and said see don't move it okay!? but when it comes apart is very easy to pop the sections back together - which in my house the kids play with toys for a while and then i like to put things away in the closet for a bit - which this i can easily break down some of it to store and then in seconds have it snapped back together again to play with. yes durability-wise is a piece of junk - but a beautiful piece of junk and is worth it if your child loves the pegasus barbies ",negative
" this was very cheaply made. i was disappointed in it's quality. also it comes apart constantly. all my daughter has to do is barely touch it and it comes all apart. i am going to try to glue the pieces in place so she can at least play with it. we have many barbie toys and this is by far the worst i have ever purchased. not to mention that is was expensive! i expected much much better quality from a barbie product ",negative

" this puzzle (also known as rubik's revenge) is good fun - and because it has another layer of movement it is much more likely to fall apart than the 3x3x3 cube. however the puzzle of reassembly is also quite fun - and requires no force! a clue to reassembly - make sure that the last two pieces are the same colour edge pieces - and they will (very gently) snap into place. a second clue: only the centre pieces (four flats pieces on each side) fit into the grooves of the ball - be gentle and your cube will be as good as new. start with the four centre pieces of one colour at the bottom - and build up the cube layer by layer. remember! no force ",negative

" i am not too happy with this item. it has a handle yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot. it is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out. and the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use. other than that it is attractive looking and constructed well ",negative
" my son loved this tent. he fit perfectly in it and it fits inside his crib so he can sleep in his tent. my only beef with it is that somehow he's bent the frame of it so now it doesn't sit right on the floor. actually it doesn't sit on the floor at all because of where it's bent. the tent would be better made if there were a floor to it and some support (similar to what keeps the top portion rigid) at the base of it to keep the legs (there aren't any but that's the best way to describe them) apart. the tent would also be better constructed if it didn't have one continuous wire for the frame on each side. if the wire gets bent there's no getting it back into its original shape unless you take out the stitching (around the whole tent frame) and repair it then restitch it but who has that kind of time? overall it's a fun toy for a little one but not a well thought out build. i'm glad we got it as a gift and it wasn't something we spent our money on ",negative

" i did not buy this from amazon but sought it out here so i could vent about this outrageous product (that's 'outrageous' in its traditional meaning that it outrages me). this is two packets of colored dust approximately the consistency of unmixed plaster. empty the plastic bags and the colored dust flies everywhere mold it in your hand and it retains its shape for a few seconds before blurring and falling apart. my wife and i repeatedly checked the packaging to see if we should add water or do something else to make this usable but apparently not. the claim on the package is that it molds like dough obviously intended to remind us of play-doh but play-doh is a clay-like material that retains its shape and can in fact be molded. this material -- again attempting to compare itself to play-doh -- states that it won't dry out. of course not! it's dust! it can't dry out there's nothing drier than dust. in case you're wondering i have no connection to play-doh or its makers (i don't even know who does make it) i'm simply the father of a 3-year old who uses play-doh often and hoped this product might be a workable addition to our playtime. wrong ",negative
" while my son enjoyed the illustrations anf fun content of the books in this set i felt it was disappointing as a learning tool for beginning readers because it moves much too quickly. the first book is just letters and letter sounds. very introductory. the second book introduces three letter words right off with no transition at all like 2 letter blends. that was ok to me since it was phonetic 3 letter words but by page 2 we were already leaping to 4 and 5 letter words and by page 3 they were already introducing a sight word - does and a double consonant word - cannot. i thought the pace was frustrating for my son. i was hoping/expecting a book devoted to just blends and/or 3 letter words. instead this program is organized by vowels with the letter a being introduced first. i don't see that as a problem but i was expecting more phonetic 3 letter words to start and introducing harder 4 and 5 letter words by maybe book 3 and sight words coming later like maybe book 4. unfortunately you can't see exactly what your getting until you open the box. nonetheless the audio is entertaining for children with music and humor thrown in and the reward stickers poster and ribbon are a fun way to recognize your child's achievement. the practice game is basically just like the word whammer fridge phonics product but with cards instead of magnets ",negative

" i had high hopes for this game but played it with a friend last night and was appalled at the number of confusing questions and just plain incorrect answers. for example one question asks which of these animals is not found exclusively in south america: (a) chinchilla (b) sloth (c) guinea pig (d) spring buck. ruling out zoos my friend reasoned that since zillions of kids in the us have pet guinea pigs the answer must be c. alas no; the correct answer is (d) spring buck with no explanation. did they mean animals in their natural habitat? we aren't sure. the question is not clearly written. another question asks the word `berserk' is derived from: (a) a norse god; (b) the german for `crazy life' (c) a tropical plant. i read this to my friend and said none of these is the right answer. the word `berserk' comes from the germanic branch of the language tree and means `bear-shirt'. the game says the correct answer is a norse god. in norse mythology the god `berserker' always fought in a state of frenzy. there is no such norse god. who wrote these questions? one of the aspects of trivia games that i enjoy is the prospect of learning something in the process of playing; this game concerns me because i do not know which answers are incorrect. from a learning standpoint the badly written questions and poorly researched answers make this a frustrating and intellectually dangerous game.

" when putting together the mobile section of this item i was very disappointed in its flimsiness. it looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic. when i turned it on i was disappointed a second time this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes as it rotates. it's so loud you can't hear the music which is a shame because i'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving lights. the third disappointment - the buttons are very hit-and-miss. sometimes the music buttons don't work (the lullaby one worked eventually once i mashed it in really hard). that i could live with but it's fiddling with the other controls that is really irritating. control for music off lights on/off and rotation on/off all seem to be tied up in two buttons. if you have the music and lights going then turn on the rotation the music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on. then you have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you get them all going the way you want them. please bear in mind i am not particularly daft - i managed to figure out my tivo remote in a day or so - but the controls for this baby's musical mobile make no sense to me. i thought at first it was supposed to be deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby's natural curiosity' but after two nights it really got on my nerves and if i can't figure it out i don't see how my one year old is supposed to. i can only think that there is something very screwed up with the circuitry in there. i'm not dismissing this item all together. the music is lovely - not too simplified and not too electronic-sounding. the minute waltz is particularly nice (i've noticed my son scans for it). the lights are lovely too and do look pretty when they're moving if you can stand the buzzing. my son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself with as he falls asleep. but if you buy it i'd recommend testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return it.

" my husband and i just bought the family feud 2nd edition dvd tv games. i have to say we both loved this game when it was first on (and on gsn as repeats) and i like the computer version. we played this once by ourself and a couple of times with friends and we all have found that this game was boring & as someone said they can't believe they put this out. if you are going to get this game then buy the computer version. you have 5 rounds round #1 round #2 double money round triple money round fast money round you have team a and team b. if you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go for steal. however you only get one x. per guide...if an answer is revealed that team a did not have written down they press wrong answer button and pass the remote to team b. team b now has the opportunity to steal the round. so most of the game was passing the remote back and forth. if the steal answer matches any one of the remaining answers they steal the round (even if you-team a had that written down) and takes the money for any answer the other team has answered correctly (even if they got 4 out of 5 and both teams say have the same answer) the game itself was simple and basic. there was no real fun to it. we tried to play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it boring and not all that fun. one person said they would have more fun watching the game itself on tv over playing this version of the game. you get two markers (red and blue) to write on the two wipe-clean score cards. the negative on this is that the markers do not write all that good on these cards even though they were meant to. another thing is that the same game will come up more than once. we had the same question and answer come up even though we only played twice. this is the 3rd or 4th dvd game we have been given or bought. this is the only one where we disliked it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving it away as we will not be playing it again ",negative

" as in my title i have mixed feelings about this toy. my children both have the original color version of the videnow. i thought i would upgrade them to the newer version. they have a cheap feel to them and don't seem to work very well. in fact one is going back to the store next week for a trade in. there is a lock botton that freezes the bottons so you can't accidently turn off while watching. but it seems like the buttons freeze up on their own quite often. i can see why the batteries go dead quickly because if a child can't turn off the unit it just gets left on! i am very dissapointed in this. the kids really enjoyed their color versions and i feel i shouldn't have gone to the extra expense to upgrade them. however even with it's faults my kids still enjoy them. my kids don't watch a lot of tv and prefer the shorter pvds to the long dvds. i prefer that too. that way i can say they can watch one show and know they won't be watching for an hour or more. if you are a parent thinking about purchassing one- keep you receipt in case you need to exchange and carefully think about how your kids will be using it. if your child is easily dissapointed by items that may not work properly this may not be the item for you ",negative

" this toy is the most stupidest thing i have ever had. the only reason why i gave it a one is because you couldn't give it a zero. first of all this thing beeps every five seconds. i swear even when im sleeping this thing beeps. it wsn't always like that when i got it i would bring it to school then everyone started getting one even kindergarners had one then the princble banned them because one third grader lost hers. during class kids would ask me do you want to connect? im just saying this is a toy for little ones. this toy can also get repetative i mean its a baby then it gets a tooth ache toddler teen adult old person. so parents if your thining about buying this toy for your children dont because in about a month and a half they would probably stop using it. so dont buy it ",negative
" i couldn't agree more about this product. it's appalling how badly made it is. the concept is very cute - a toolbox that unfolds into bridges and roads for the small die-cast vehicles. my 2.5 year-old has a hard enough time dealing with frustration without this toy adding to it! the bridge on the right doesn't properly attach or stay up and the road pieces do not attach properly. it's also a battle to get the tool box to connect together. my son always wants to play with it but i can't cope with his cries of frustration when it all falls apart. i think this toy will have to mysteriously disappear one night while he is sleeping. they should withdraw this rubbish from the market and refund us all our money!

" this is the best deck ever! but if you are looking for armed dragon lv7 go to soul of the deulist booster packs because this doesn't have it. but i love red eyes darkness dragon ",negative
" i absolutely love this deck. i bought this along with zombie madness and the warrior's triumph structure decks. they all rock but this is my favorite. and for the guy who gave the winged dragon of ra tip on the bottom of the card it says this card cannot be used in a duel. so even if you happen to get one [which costs a lot] you can't officially use it. overall this deck is very cool. i love red eyes darkness dragon! p.s. for best results buy the yu-gi-oh! deluxe pack for 20$. it comes with dragon's roar and zombie madness plus two rare cards [rope of life and armed dragon lv7]. here's what they do: rope of life pgd-105-ultra rare trap card: this card can only be activated by discarding your entire hand when 1 of your own monsters is sent to the graveyard as a result of battle. special summon the monster just sent to the graveyard in face-up attack or defense position and increase its atk by 800 points. armed dragon lv7 this card cannot be normal summoned or set. this card cannot be special summoned except by the effect of armed dragon lv5. send 1 monster card from your hand to the graveyard to destroy all face-up monsters on your opponent's side of the field with an atk equal to or less than the atk of the sent monster. add this the deck for an amazing combo! start off by setting a masked dragon card in defense mode. when your opponent destroys it use its effect to summon armed dragon lv3. during your standby phase send it to the graveyard to special summon armed dragon lv5. then use it to attack your opponent's monster which is most likely destroyed. then when you end your turn use its effect to special summon armed dragon lv7 from your hand or deck! you now have a 2800 atk points on the field! sweet! and its effect is soooooooooo cool. i put the rope of life card in my warrior's triumph structure deck. it helps out a lot! i hope you will make the right choice in buting this deck or the more preferable deluxe pack. yu-gi-oh! your move ",negative
" i purchased this item yesterday also set it up as shown. there is a little plastic gray piece that sticks up and doesnt let the cars go through. we have yet also to get one car through. a huge disappointment to my son who was excited about it. but i called mattel and they gave me a gift card for the amount i purchased it for. great customer service. i think this product should be recalled because the cars do shoot back at you at an alarming speed. hit my son in the head.

" we bought this item for our son's birthday. we assembled it exactly as shown in the directions. the cars do not launch properly into the loop - we have yet to have one car make it through the entire track. also when you place cars to launch and crash they shoot clear across the room. one knocked our daughter in the chest! not worth what we spent on the item and we are finding ourselves increasingly dissappointed with hot wheels items.

" i have been searching for the perfect handheld sudoku game and this is not it. i found it very difficult to see the numbers without a backlight even with my reading glasses. also i would perfer a stylus pen instead of having to scroll around the screen to enter a number. i do like the idea of being able to use a dry erase pen to mark off numbers but i couldn't even see those. still searching ",negative
" we gave this toy to our 4 year old son. that was 1 1/2 years ago. it worked at first but the balls did not pop up high enough for him to hit. after about 1 month the balls did not pop up at all. little tikes replaced it with a completely new toy. again it worked for a few months but now it does not work. the beeps sound (a nice feature) but nothing happens. my son has given up on the automatic feature and will sometimes use it as a t-ball stand. most of the balls are lost. thank goodness i only paid $10 for this on sale - but not even worth that much ",negative
" purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers. wanting to check out what i purchased i opened one of the five. the geodes are tiny (not as pictured). it was like breaking open dirt-clods... that have a small empty space inside... but not crystals. maybe it was a dud box but will probably be returning the other four.

" i asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year - she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter (2 yrs old at the time). she bought the two bikes at the same time same model same color same store. my daughter who is far more coordinated then my nephew tips over very easy my nephew seems to do fine. my daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies. perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily. not sure - but i know i regret that she ever got the bike -it was a total waste of money ",negative
" i bought two of these trikes for my 19 month old twin sons. within the first 10 minutes of use they both tipped over numerous times. they tipped over when they were trying to use the pedals and also when they were just using their feet on the floor. definitely not a sturdy trike. my husband and i were very disappointed and returned them immediately. in reading other reviews i see that our experience with these trikes is not unique ",negative

" i have a big dora fan in my house & this was one of her first dora dolls (last year). she played with it for the first day or two...its loud very mechanical not very appealing. the toy saw a rebirth in use when it was discovered that it she could make dora dance & terrorize the puppy. the doll only does one dance regardless of what skirt she has on now. from reading other reviews if i pushed & held it while she was wearing it she might ballet but not worth the hassle! since then my dora lover has received various other dora dolls so we have a collection that sings dances speaks various languages and the only one she plays with regularly is the dress up adventure dora - she's more posable does something other than sing and you can change her outfits. perfect for my almost 5 year old ",negative
" loud annoying and entertaining for only a day. i got this doll because my 3 and 5 year olds both had to have it. they watched it dance for about 30 minutes and that was the extent of the play with this doll. it isn't a doll that they can use imagination with snuggle with or any other type of constructive play. a dora video would have been a better choice. at least their attention would have been captured for the 30 minutes and then they would have watched it again later. in order to get the skirt to stay on (to change the song she danced to) i had to push very hard. my kids couldn't do it on their own ",negative
" the nature's fire volcano also used to be sold at the discovery channel stores. my kid loved it while it worked. lasted about a month. all of the reviews stated the same on their site. lasts from 1 to 3 months. wish i had checked it before we bought it. save your money ",negative

" the mcqueen car went first. motor sounds worked but no voice and rear wheel activation. this after about two weeks of play. then the king car stopped working. same thing no voice or rear wheel activation. the cars that came with the shake 'n go race track are holding up but go through the batterys. the cars have a tough plastic shell and alot of thought has gone into the details. one gets the impression of a quality toy when handeling it and they look good just sitting still. but that is not what we get them for.

" i feel like an idiot maybe i didn't have all the parts or something but i tried and my husband tried and my neice tried and my friend tried and my stepson tried and none of us could figure out how to get this thing together. since there were no instructions that helped alot. there was a picture but the hoops that went over secured to nothing and fell on the kid making it utterly useless. though there were little things that appeared to attach to something they taunted us and we tried and tried to attach this here and that there and maybe that will work...it was ridiculous. we haven't had the issue with any other baby thing...not car seats not the red wagon not the baby gates not the crib or the cradle...but this thing after several attempts we just took the hangdowns off and she played with those until the batteries died. we sold it at a garage sale for a buck and felt like glad for it to be out of our lives and out of our closet ",negative
" this item is cheap and i don't mean the price. it will not stay together. the plastic frames do not attach well to the mat because it is held with velcro that keeps coming undone. the arched bars are not bent enough causing one side to pop up off the floor. i tried bending them myself but they always return to their original shape. pay the extra money and get a better mat ",negative
" we just put the stupid thing together and put the batteries in and nothing worked. the light would go on and off but there were no sounds at all. we made sure we had everything plugged in correctly but it still wouldn't work. after all the time of putting it together what a disappointment. i will be calling fisher price tomorrow and seeing if they have any suggests and/or taking it back to toyrus.

" although crayola is a wonderful brand i was not impressed with their color wonder fingerpaints. the time between when my children put it on the paper and the time it actually appears is too long for them and they get frustrated. it is very hard to keep their attention long enough to make an entire picture. also it is not mess free. the paints are very greasy and you end up cleaning it off of everything they touch (other than paper) anyways. i did not like how mushy the paint was...i am still finding globs of it everywhere ",negative

" i read all the negative reviews on this table and decided to go ahead and order hoping i would get lucky and not have all the problems the other customers had. don't do it! the table arrived poorly packaged and beat up just as the others here have described. one corner of the table top was bashed in another piece of wood was split the green paint from the table top rubbed off onto the white table leg and edge of the other table leg was dented in revealing the plywood underneath the paint. this is a very cheap table - cheaply constructed of plywood. it is functional but just not very attractive since it arrives already damaged. just beware before you buy that you will more than likely be getting a banged up train table ",negative
" as far as i know there is only one tempo and one type of dance sequence on this mat. no matter how much we play around with the different buttons it does not do anything different. this was a big request from my 6 year old daughter for christmas and now she hardly plays with it. it entertains our 15 month old twins more! resist any begging by your kids for this item and buy something else a cd boombox maybe ",negative

" followed all directions added fish within hours the fish were sleeping on the bottom of the tank. luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so i took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better. changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water added fish 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom. took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better. something is seriously wrong with this tank. bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what... they are doing great! do not put fish in the shark tank. they will die ",negative

" i agree with the comments about the taste and size. personally i think someone should look into the false advertising. on the preztel kit which is also a 4 pack you only get two pretzels. one of the packs is salt and another is glaze. then you get two packs of some pretzel dough. these pretzels are not much larger than the ones you get in a bag out of the vending machine. total rip-off. hasbro should be ashamed of its marketing staff ",negative
" horrible advertising on these packages. it shows a huge delicious bowl of pasta when says 4 pack but it only makes two bowls of pasta. the servings are so tiny that if you make both packets together you maybe get a half a bowl of pasta. not to mention that it takes about 11-15 minutes to cook! pasta's so sticky you have to use no-stick spray. the taste is so bad my son who eats anything wouldn't touch it and the sauce packet was hard as a rock so it didn't mix up and left big chunks in the ketchup you have to add. we tried the mac and cheese too it takes 15 minutes to cook and again says 4 pack but that's only 2 pastas and 2 cheeses. very expensive hardly any food and pretty nasty to eat. they need to be alot more realistic on their packaging instead of trying to use false pictures and saying 4pack eight thumbs down from this family ",negative
" the go-cart is much smaller that it appeared to be. my 2 year old barely fits. these is no reverse and it is a sit in toy. so the child has to get completely out to turn around or you have to follow them around. the steering column is not straight so the steering wheel has to be sideways to drive straight. all together it is not a very impressive to. my daughter enjoys it very much but i should not have got rid of her lil' quad.

" our almost-4 year old son loves dragons and has one of the imaginext dinosaur sets so we thought we'd really surprise him on christmas this year with the imaginext dragon set. while i'm very happy with how happy my son is with it (he's been playing with it for hours) i have a feeling we're going to be in much the same boat as some other reviewers. pros: - interesting color scheme - good detail on most pieces - re-configurable - the dragon figure is really neat - the trap door rotating floor and other moving parts are a lot of fun for my son to operate - got it on sale at the local toys r' us for 11 dollars less than listed on the web site. cons - the directions are picture-only and much too small to see fine detail. - the pieces are not packaged together logically so that the elements of the set are all in one bag. you have to open every bag and lay the pieces out in order to be able to find everything and even then there's some question as to whether you've got the right part turned the right way per the above comment about the directions. - the whole thing comes tumbling down like a house of cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play. i've had to put it back together no less than 5 times since i initially put it together this morning. some of the connector pieces don't fit tightly enough into the sockets on other pieces so they tend to just slide out instead of locking together firmly. i think that next year we'll just stick to legos ",negative

" my daughter had a drink and wet doll that she could give a bath but it filled up with water and even though you couldn't empty all the water out it still leaked everywhere. i got rid of it hoping she wouldn't notice. well she did so a new doll i can give a bath to was on her christmas list. i wanted to find a solid rubber doll that would not fill up with water. like the dolls i had as a child. i thought this would be it since the top half visible in the box appeared to have no holes. wrong. it has a soft torso filled with polystyrene beads that get waterlogged. the water all (i hope) drains out of the bottom of the feet after a couple of minutes of squeezing. then you have to let the torso drip dry. last night after bathtime my daughter wanted to tuck her doll into to the doll cradle but couldn't because she was still wet. the other features are fine. the shower works great. you don't have to fill up the fish. just attach it to the tube and squeeze. it suctions water from the bottom of the floaty. the doll doesn't sit upright in the floaty but she doesn't flop completely over either. i don't care for the bow sewn on to the head. who takes a bath with a bow on? but if you take it off she'll have holes in her head ",negative

" i just finished the world's largest crossword puzzle last night. it's been one heck of a project--approximately equivalent to 200 slightly oversized daily crossword puzzles. i'm going to love hanging the puzzle on my wall--it really is something to behold when it's all done. but it's also a big undertaking that requires a great deal of patience and perserverance. the puzzle itself is moderately difficult but made more so by the fact that somewhere during the revision (it's been re-done once) or perhaps during the original construction some errors were made. because of this many of the clues don't match the answers. add to that the fact that the author uses many hundreds possibly even thousands of abbreviations that are specific to a certain field (e.g. abbreviation used in electrical engineering) that no lay person ever has a chance of knowing and you've got what can be an exercise in frustration. you can work for hours on one small section and only later find out that the clue doesn't fit the answer. i'm generally pretty dogged in completing crosswords until letter perfect but that's not possible here. so i had to sacrifice a bit of my honor and force myself to give up after a couple of passes through the ups and downs. still it's about 98+ percent solvable which is pretty good when you consider how intricate the puzzle is and how hard it must have been to create. overall i enjoyed the process and am pleased with the result. if you've got the time and energy i highly recommend this.

" this dog looked so cute and fun in the commercials and it was the one of only two things my 4 year old really asked santa for. come christmas morning today i open it and put the batteries in and all it did was whine and we were petting the head and chest hard. after about 3 minutes i did get it to bark then another 3 minutes later i got the tail to wag but the leg wouldn't shake for another 3 minutes. 20 minutes of trying to get it to do any thing at all it finally licked but the tongue was not wet and i did put water in it so it should have been wet. then my daughter got mad because she couldn't get it to lick again. the dog doesn't even stand up like it appears to be doing on the box.. it just lays there. if you are buying this be prepared to be paying for a highly priced stuffed animal because that is all it amounts to. i can't believe a manufacturer would put some thing like this out there so that kids can be disappointed on christmas morning... this product should have just plainly been recalled ",negative
" just like a big chunk of us right now i'm quite the sudoku addict. i just can't put those little puzzles down! so i have to tell you first if you haven't worked sudoku puzzles yet you are really missing out! get your hands on some! naturally i was excited to try out a sudoku game and race against my friends to solve the puzzles. but what a disappointment! one small board several people straining to see it everyone racing to fill in the puzzle...it just doesn't work. the way they designed this game was to have a board which is the puzzle to be solved and number tiles that you distribute evenly amongst the players. everyone rushes to fill in the puzzle and the person who uses all their number tiles first is the winner assuming the puzzle is solved correctly. first of all if you have more than 2 people playing the players aren't all going to be able to see the board well. some people are going to have the board upside-down trying to solve it. that's rough! talk about getting confused between 6s and 9s! plus everyone's hands are in the way while they're laying their tiles which makes it really hard to see and concentrate on the puzzle. next inevitably in the games i've played someone lays a tile wrong. then the whole game is thrown off. the instructions say that if someone rids themselves of their tiles but placed them incorrectly then the next person to finish would win provided all their tiles are correct. most likely if one person has made an error that will have caused a chain reaction and the next person's tiles will also be placed wrong and not necessarily by fault of either of the players. it could have been anyone who started the chain reaction. the format just doesn't work for this game. my advice is to pass on this particular game. perhaps a game where people were racing side-by-side on the same puzzle but with their own puzzle would work better ",negative

" i'm more or less fine that they changed a murder with an object in a room to who ate the cake at what time with what beverage. buying this for kids and all that. its not as intuitive or intrinsicly interesting at least to me but hopefully it is to kids. however they also changed the mechanics of the game from adult clue and not in a good way. the room variable for example drops out. its not relevant. its who ait the cake at what time with what drink. it just feels silly to set up the room pieces and move from room to room if the room is irrelevant. the idea is probably to change the mechanics to make the game simpler. well the problem with that is it was pretty simple in the first place. and the change sort of makes it more complex in a way. you need to remember the rooms where you already checked tokens. now the sheet does list the rooms you could use that to check off the rooms where you checked tokens. but since the rooms are not otherwise relevant its not intuitive to track the rooms where you checked tokens. the game is also incredibly cheaply constructed. for example the die does not have numbers on it you have to put number stickers on it. and the board isn't flimsy -- flimsy would be an improvement. anyway not recommended ",negative

" this car pictured could be a base or first version defintely not worth 299.00 these are going for 100.00 and less on the web. if you havent noticed the differences in the packaging it wouldnt suprise me. lots of people dont notice. heres the differences below... on these 5 cars there is two versions of each driver(5 different drivers) that were made. first versions or base version and second versions or added features version. the first versions have no added features stickers and you cannot race any two (or more) cars of the 5 different drivers' cars at the same time! dale sr. and dale jr. jeff gordon jimmie johnson and tony stewart cars of the first versions (no added features) cannot race together! transmitter frequencys cannot be changed. speed and steering are straight function. (no varilable anything) they either turn right full turn or left full turn or it goes straight. speed is either it goes full on or it doesnt. same for reverse gear. again each of the 5 different drivers' cars made are two different versions of the same car one has more features than the other. updated or added features versions have added features stickers. those added features are... digital proportional steering (variable steering) which means you can turn the transmitter wheel slightly and the car turns a little. turn the transmitter wheel alot and the car turns alot. variable speed control this means you pull back on the trigger a little the car moves a little pull back on the trigger all the way and the car takes off! this also works for reverse gears as well now if this isnt cool enough... each added features car has different frequencies for different drivers' car. the transmitters for the cars are different as well. added features version transmitter has two trim adjustments on the back of the remote as well as the frequency chip on the side of the remote than can be changed and can also be changed on the chassis of the car. so if you own 2 of the tony stewart cars you would have to have a frequency pack to race them at the same time. now two or more different drivers' cars can race together (or five people can race 5 different cars). no two alike cars can race together unless you have the frequency of another car and transmitter to change it or a frequency pack from team up inc. all 5 frequency chips do not come with the car in the box off the shelf. this frequency pack is sold seperately! you can also purchase tires suspension parts and body hold down clips fully painted and ready to use new spare or other drivers' teams bodies extra rechargeable battery packs seperately! i have done lots of research on these cars and should you have any questions please ask...nascarnbroncosfans@msn.co ",negative
" i am an active 48 year old and i own a vurtego pro pogo stick. i ride motocross and i mountain bike regulary and i like the exercise and fun factor it offers. i chose the vurtego pro after doing some online research and i am totally pleased with the performance. the guys who designed and developed the vurtego pro and fit sticks were looking for a way to offer a more affordable model for beginers and people looking for a fun but still high quality stick. the power model came up short of their extpectations and they pulled thier endorsement due to quality and safety concerns. for the money the power pogo is a fairly decent pogo stick but its not going to stand up to the abuse and demands of an expert or extreme pogo stick rider. it takes allot of effort and experience to go 6' or higher on any pogo stick. i am pretty good at mine after about a month of use i am getting up in the 3' range and bouncing 500 plus consecutive times in a session before taking a break and going for another session or two a great workout! i have pogo stick experience and can pull off most of the basic tricks i consider myself a beginner to intermediate at the most. i doubt that i will ever reach the six foot level at my age but that was never my goal. i know that the people at vurtego are still working to develope a model that will be safe and affordable for those looking for a capeable high quality and durable stick. if your looking to go 6' and pull off serious stunts i would buy the orignal vurtego pro or the fit model for a great workout. if you are looking for a little less i would wait for the next version that the vurtego people will offer and endorse. i personally would avoid this one.

" i would give this kit zero stars if i could. the instructions say that it takes 6-8 weeks for the seeds to sprout. i kept them in moist peat and warm temperatures for over three months after the recommended period of refrigeration. not a single seed sprouted. i finally had to throw out the whole kit when mold took over. complete waste of time and money. but if you're feeling lucky you should know that most of the seeds in this kit aren't much bigger than pinheads and they all come packaged together in the same tiny plastic bag. so if you want to have each type of plant growing in a different section of the plastic tray provided in the kit - like that shown on the box cover - you need to separate out each seed under a strong magnifying glass. and even then you won't be successful as most of these seeds look just like ground pepper. i accidentally spilled a few on the floor and after sweeping them all up i literally couldn't tell them from the other debris in the dustpan. by the way it takes a minimum of 6-8 years living in ideal growing conditions for any of the plants in this kit to reach the sizes shown on the box cover. these are not plants that can simply be put on a windowsill. they need an environment that is not easily provided in the average home - lots of very bright light (about 15 hours a day) lots of humidity an acidic growth medium (such as sphagnum moss) and about 80 degrees. and even then these are very slow-growing plants. to keep the humidity level high you'll need some kind of terrarium preferably covered to keep the humidity level high. but if you use incandescent bulbs to provide the necessary level of light the amount of heat they produce can easily raise the temperature to lethal levels. for this reason i recommend a combination of fluorescent bulbs and a moist/dry heating pad at the bottom. be sure that whatever heating pad you use isn't the type that shuts off automatically after one hour of use. some warnings... these plants flourish only in a very limited range of environments and nourishment. the care you would normally give a houseplant will - in all likelihood - kill these plants: never feed them animal protein (like hamburger). the fats in meat aren't digestible and can kill them. never use tap water to water them. the mineral build-up can kill them so use distilled water only. never feed them insects that have been killed by insecticides like raid. carnivorous plants should be fed soft-bodies insects like small slugs ants termites etc. rather than hard-shelled insects such as beetles. well-stocked pet stores will carry dried mealworms but even these will need to be cut into very small pieces. just as a baby needs tiny mouthfuls of food so too do venus flytraps. never fertilize them. these are very slow-growing plants and any attempt to force them to grow will kill them.

" teething two molars and a cold with a croup-like cough for over a week made my little toddler ultra-grumpy and zapped his energy. poor fella couldn't even play with blocks or a puzzle without falling to pieces with frustration. i was going to buy 100 balls to put in his baby pool from the summer but this whole thing on sale was less expensive than a pack of balls. he shuffles around rolls the balls down the ramps and dunks them through the rings for hours. no mental challenge no frustration and it doesn't zap all his energy. it's made with the same weak plastic a 99 cent beach ball is made out of and overnight the whole thing is visably less inflated--wish it was a little more substantial. the sides are not sturdy to sit on or to be used to pull-up on. at 31 inches he can barely get in and out safely. the balls are inconsistent--one will be thick and hard and the next is so thin you can squish the sides in a full inch. we're not trusting it to last a long time under everyday wear and tear. our plan is to store it out of the way until the next rainy day he's sick or worse if mommy gets sick! no need for an air pump. with two of us huffing and puffing we got it inflated in under 10 minutes. take note that some of these ball pits have free shipping--the shipping on this cost more than the sale price ",negative

" the only thing deluxe about this addition is the glossy foil cover of the box which is designed to make you think you are getting something special by paying more money. nothing could be further from the truth. this edition screams cheap from the second the lid comes off. let's go thru the hype above and set the record straight on all the deluxe features: the board is a quad-fold affair redesigned presumably to allow a smaller less expensive box. it has much less rigidity than the single-fold board of the classic version. when it is left out for an extended period of time especially overnite the ends of the board curl up and refuses to lay flat. the houses and hotels are completely featureless just small blocks of wood. they looked to be dipped in some type of vegetable dye rather than painted. this is probably an attempt to eek out a few extra cents of corporate profit. the bankers tray and property wheel are flimsy plastic jokes. neither would last under play by children much more than a few games. this edition is a sad legacy to a great game and the cheapness of the set detracts from the joy of play. for the additional cost all you are really getting is the fancy foil cover and one extra play token plus a board that curls up at the edges: whoopee! my advice: save the extra money and buy the classic version.

" i thought the art had a certain charm and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read i think it's quite nice. (too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.) the moment the child starts to read though--better hide it quick because... unfortunately the book reads like a condensed communist manifesto for kids (as others have noted) or a socialist agenda primer. i don't know for sure that's what marcus pfister had as an aim and i'm not going to speculate on his politics. he has three kids and may raise them as he likes and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat. yes i suppose sharing is nice. certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in america we get paid for that (charity is voluntary not coerced). furthermore stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily better just unique and interesting) or giving away all your possessions is a lousy way to make and keep friends isn't it? is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change not pandering)? is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad? almost seems like it at least to me. furthermore there's an overtone of only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever i've seen. of course people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me but that won't make them right.

" my 3 boys (ages 4 7 and 9) love their lightsabers so the idea of a spring activated version was too hard to pass up. imagine the disappointment when the fragile spring/force action is only good for about 3 tries and then it falls apart with no way to get inside and fix it. we have 3 of them (darth vader obi-wan and luke skywalker). vader was done before 9am christmas morning. the other two are hanging on by a thread and now the boys have to be very gentle when they load the saber. the worst part is that the light up feature is tied to the spring so it does nothing now. these are not rough kids and it's just a matter of time before the other springs get jammed. stick with the original light up sabers and forget the force action.

" i had searched high and low via the internet trying to find the perfect baby doll pram. good quality material well made and if possible fold away storage ability. when i found the corolle pram /carriage i thought i found it plus the added bonus of a adjustable handle so no matter how tall my grand daughter was she could push her babies. but when it arrived i was not thrilled. what looked good on paper was not so in life. true it folds away to store in a closet no problem. but this ability is to easy and i fear the child will pinch her fingers. all that keeps the stroller in an up right position in 2 lame flip over metal rings. now with the wonderful way a simple umbrella stroller for a real baby folds way why wasn't this technology used on this product. sure an adult would have to fold it up but i would feel better if that was the case then a 4 year old maybe getting broken fingers. also the cute canopy. it does not stay on if you even move it to open a tiny bit. i spent $113.00 on this item thinking i was getting a well put together item that would last years for my grand daughter. only way that will happen is if i can weld parts together and forget about ever wanting to store it. i did not buy this from amazon only cause i wanted it right away and so bought it from another shop. but i knew amazon would have this forum and wanted to make sure others did not waste their money on this product. go with the other one for $33 at least maybe it will stay together. now i have to hope i can return this thing to where i bought it. but i think corolle should either rethink this items design or just pull it from the stores. it's not what a good parent would want for their child. thanks & i hoped this helped ",negative

" my nephew was very excited when he saw the box and the picture. unfortunately the inflatable suit is not really inflatable. it requires constant air to keep it poofy looking. it is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower (battery operated) to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated. the battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit. everytime he moves it pops out. the fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him. he loves superman and loves having a cape. he opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with. i suppose we got what we paid for. cheap prices doesn't equate to quality. i felt like my nephew got only a couple of minutes out of this toy. would not recommend it to anyone else... unfortunately..

" have this unit in out house we have the one with one base unit and two mobile units. a few things to note. the ones we had do not offer rechargeable batteries. it uses alkaline only or if you have your own charger you could use rechargeable but would be nicer if it recharged while plugged in. we live in nyc queens to be exact. we hear taxi cab radio chatter over this at times especially at night. also if unit is close to base unit static is not too bad but still annoying in bedroom but if you have it one floor away forget it. unless child is screaming all you hear is static. on both units. only has two channels a & b which are set manually at both base and hand held units. so if you have a bad signal in middle of night you have to go into child's room and change channel. just don't wake the baby! ouch! also missing a pager and a walkie talkie feature. they would be very nice. not a deal breaker if they don't have it but it can be handy especially if your two floors up with baby with a full diaper and spouse is in basement and you need more diapers from garage. i am about to have a second child and i am replacing this unit with a better one i am looking at one of the new digital units that have the noise/static reduction. consumer reports gave some of them their top marks. they are however way more pricey than these some are near $200 and only one receiver. but they all have charging bases and most importantly they are static free with auto channel switching ",negative

" this is a very mediocre knights kingdom set. there's not much of interest going on here and the small castle suffers from lazy design. the colorful knights of morcia are back once again fighting against vladek the black knight. two of the good knights make an appearance here (blue and purple) and we also get vladek a dark soldier and a skeleton. the minifigs are as charismatic as ever each sporting his own unique expression. vladek and his henchman have that cute i'm evil lego frown. our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories. swords and shields and a black hatchet for the henchman. the scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large scorpion monster. the creature is constructed from a mixture of regular and technic parts and he has hinged pieces for an articulated tail and pincers. the blue knight is accompanied by his horse who has a cute mini-catapult strapped to his side. the scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle which has a front gate that can be raised and lowered. high atop the tower is a mini-catapult and a thin boom crane with a small barred jail cell dangling precariously from it. the rest of the castle is just walls floors and a staircase. this castle is very fragile. mine fell apart several times while i was working on building it. on the whole the design just isn't all that great. handle with care and play with care. colors are mostly black dark gray dark red and brown. this set has one of those nice walls with the barred window and some signature knights kingdom battlement pieces. this set works as an addition to vladek's dark fortress. on its own it's stunningly less impressive. the good news is that a savvy lego maniac can take the castle parts and build a better castle with them. my verdict: one thumb up for the scorpion monster (who can be added to your other knights kingdom adventures) one thumb down for the rest. could've been better. my advice is to get vladek's dark fortress. it's more than worth the price of admission. for those still hungering for more knights kingdom action after vladek's fortress has been built and conquered this set is better than nothing ",negative

" not only do you use chocolate syrup which runs off of the cookies pretzels strawberries etc. but it doesn't even warm up the syrup. so like someone else said you may as well fill up a bowl with hershey's syrup and let the kids dip away. the only reason i gave this two stars instead of one is because my kids did seem to have a really good time playing with this. they thought it was great even though it was cold syrup instead of warm chocolate ",negative

" i should have paid attention to the reviewer who stated this doll is a piece of junk and the only good thing is how the doll is dressed! being optimistic after the first purchase of the doll proved to be disappointing (she laughs adorably; she makes the sucking noise; she makes a contented sound which becomes 'stuck' and the mechanism on her back must be turned off; she does not kick her legs; she does not close her eyes when rocked) i purchased a second doll and this doll was less functional than the first one. the second doll cries continually. she does close her eyes and that's it! i returned the second one and kept the first one because she is more functional. don't waste your dollars on this one ",negative
" i am a parent of a 9 year old daughter who loves dolls. she was given the love me chou chou doll for christmas (12/25/05). on christmas day we were unable to get the doll to fall asleep so on 12/26/05 i went back to the store to exchange the doll. with no luck i found that the second doll would not fall asleep either. i looked on the zapf-creation web-site under most frequently asked questions and received more instructions on how to get the doll to fall asleep and still the doll will not fall asleep. apparently this is a problem not only with the doll my daughter has but with other customers as well. if the company knows that this is one of the most frequently asked questions why not remodel the doll so she can fall asleep like the instructions say? it is very discouraging for a 9 year old who has hopes of seeing the doll do something that is being advertised and it does not do that. it is also very upsetting to a parent who has to continue going back and forth to a store and hopes of looking for a working doll. these dolls are very expensive and should work like the instructions say they should. we have tried everything we can to get the love me chou chou doll to fall asleep and nothing seems to make that happen.. i have even spoken with another parent in the store where the doll was purchased and was advised her daughter also was crying on christmas day because they could not get the doll to fall asleep. she then explained she had her mother a grandmother to rock the doll and guess what the doll finally fell asleep keep in mind this was not rock-a-bye chou chou. we have even tried to rock this doll with no luck of getting the doll to fall asleep. i have even taken the doll back to the store for an exchange but was advised the doll is no longer being sold at the store where i purchased it.

" the concept is perfect. it is small but fit my bigger 3 year old okay. the pedal mechanism is difficult to master but doable. the steering is for slight turns not any sharp turns. i rated this item 2 stars because the box was obviously opened prior to me receiving it. it most likely was a returned item. it was also defective with the metal rod for the pedal mechanism totally disassembled. i fixed it but then the other medal metal rod came apart as well. the product is very cheaply made but the sound effects and look is perfect for a batman lover. i have written to etoys and i will see how they respond. my sons loved the car nevertheless ",negative

" my sone loves this trike but has not been able to use it much due to the fact that it keeps breaking. the first one i got had a broken steering wheel lock - it kept slipping into lock position and my son couldn't turn the wheel anymore! so i called radio flyer and they graciously sent out a new one(i did not have to provide proof of purchase or anything). on the new one the parent handle would not lock into place. so i called again and they sent out a new parent handle. i replaced it and everything seemed to work fine until we went up or down a slight incline in which case the handle would come unlocked again. i called radio flyer again. at this point they are sending a new one which quality control is supposed to look over first and they want the old one back to take a look at it. i really do like this trike but the quality is not great. if you purchase it and have problems definitely call radio flyer to get one that works correctly. don't even bother to return it to the store. radio flyer will send parts or replacements free of charge and you don't have to hassle with going back to the store ",negative

" we've had a number of gazillion bubble machines. the first - this one with an upright rotating set of bubble wands - worked relatively well but stopped working after maybe a dozen uses. (granted one of those uses was for a few hours). when the level of liquid is low the machine stops making bubbles since it has to pick up enough liquid to cover the wand. we replaced it the next year with the typhoon machine - this was awesome produced a huge quantity of bubbles and worked more reliably since the bubble liquid is sucked up and put on the wands no matter how low the supply of liquid. it has a large reservoir at the bottom so you don't need to fill it very often - it takes a lot of liquid though. our issue now is getting the liquid. gazillion liquid does produce the best bubbles - they last well etc. etc. etc. however very few stores stock the liquid and except for when i first bought the first machine no-one stocks large size bottles. even the online vendors like toys.com who are supposed to have them never have them in stock (i've been on their notify list for a long time!) i've ended up buying from someone in canada on ebay - otherwise buying the smaller bottles at toysrus target etc. is just too expensive. both of these machines don't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids (especially the cheaper kinds in very large size bottles) are much thinner and the liquid drips right off the wands before it has a chance to pass by the blower part to make any bubbles. we're planning to start making our own bubble liquid and hopefully that will cover us. otherwise the machines are useless now.

" i hate monopoly but loved the idea of making my own game board. sadly myoo had so many limitations! i gave it a higher ed rating because you can turn the game into an educational one but it isn't intrisically educational. it doesn't print out spaces with color bars just little green squares that you glue on the board below the pre-printed color bars. the background on everything you print is school bathroom green. you are stuck with lotto squares on the board (bad for me since i believe gambling is evil). and you only have twelve good/bad news cards. i liked making my own money though. i figured out how to do most of the same stuff in word. here's how: i took the board from a your town clone of monopoly and measured between the big squares. i think the individual squares are 2.5 by 3.5 but it doesn't matter since your board may be different. in word i used a legal-sized paper (i think that's a5 for you brits) and made a table that was nine columns that's how many are on my board) and two rows. then i messed with it to get the proportions correct. you can fit three rows on one sheet of legal paper if the return is really small like 5 points. that gives you space to cut. to get color bars get your cursor in the top row. type any letter. then highlight it go up to format and click on borders and shading. click on shading click on a color then make sure it says cell and not text or table. i use only 15 percent for most colors. click on ok and you should have a color bar. type in whatever text you want. then click below to type in your property name. on printing i found the last squares were outside the printing range so i will only have eight squares next time and will print a separate sheet for railroad squares. the corner squares are about 2.5 inches on my board. i would recommend you make them bigger then trim to size so you won't have any dead space on your board. cut and glue to a board you picked up at a thrift shop or yard sale and painted or covered. the property cards. these were actually easier than i thought. make a table one column wide and two rows deep. make it fill the whole page. color as above and type in whatever you want. when you print them out print out 8 or 16 pages to a sheet to get cards. for chance and community chest ... well what i came up with was using mail merge and a shipping label template. you just print out on regular card or paper and cut. the data file used for the merge would have your classy one-liners. i don't know about putting graphics in. also i can't figure out how to use merge. i did it once but can't figure it out now. money i haven't been able to do. i have quarkxpress and adobe pagemaker but don't know how to use either program. plus i wanted to make the money in paint or something simple. hope these directions help someone ",negative

" here's a quick primer for parents looking to buy science kits for the early grade school set (i.e. k - 3rd). every science kit including this one basically tells you to mix vinegar with baking soda and voila! you made a volcano. nevermind that in later years some kid will go hiking in the crater of mt. st. helen's during an eruption thinking it is just harmless cooking products. use safe chemicals to make scientific changing colors? you guessed it -- food dye. all these kits basically include a set of plastic test tubes and instructions telling you to open your kitchen cupboards. back in the middle ages people who sold this kind of hokum for the price it now commands were called alchemists. they eventually went out of business. buy the kid a suzukie violin or a football helmet instead ",negative

" i bought this puzzle for my kid after he solved the original cube. i had read the review here and other places stating that one needed to be cautious when turning the puzzle. however our major problem with it was that the orange stickers (within ten minutes of playing with the cube) began to peel back and fall off. we tried using glue (they had no stick to them) to put them back but it was not long after that the green stickers began curling back and falling off as well. the major problem is that these turned out not to be stickers after all but rather colored squares of vinyl adhereing to additional stickers beneath (all white) by means of static. they fall off easily. this is a nice puzzle for show (impressive on the desk) but not for actual continued use. hopefully rubik's can use proper stickers or adhesive in the future and maybe even tighten up the design so that this can be used as a fun puzzle ",negative
" great company - terrible toy. my daughter got this toy for christmas and waited all day for daddy to bring home the 4 c batteries which were not included. she was excited until we turned it on. 1) the frame is not secure and will open when you reach into the middle to change the picture disk. 2) the light is not very bright and will not work in mid-day light. 3) the image is quite small - only takes up the middle 3 inches of the paper - not even close to what is pictured on the box. 4) the clamps that hold the paper are not easy for tiny fingers to use. 5) because the small picture is in the middle of the page and the clamps are on the far edges you can't shift the paper to re-use the paper. you get one tiny picture in the middle of standard size piece of paper and its a waste. the chalk board was fine - but the whole piece slides across the table when you push to draw. big disappointment. get some washable markers and some tracing paper and don't waste your money on this suprisingly junky toy ",negative

" we got this when our son was about 4 months old and at first he did love it. there was a slight rubber\plastic smell with everything in the tub time tub but we thought it would fade with time. well six months later the smell was still there and our son ended up stop playing with most of the bath toys except the squirting bath buddies.we did all the precautionary steps to keep the bath toys clean yet they grew mold in a very short amount time. the playtime tub toys were good except the teething sailing boats which also had the rubber smell. plus the stacking tubs do not make practical storage because the lids are too flimsy. there are some good points with this product but i feel it is not worth the $35 price tag. guess that's why it was on clearance at the store. it was the combination of quality and price that made me give it only 2 stars.

" i bought leappad plus writing on impulse at the store wanting to help my son with writing phonics etc. he used it a few times but i almost have to beg for him to use it...and that's sad. i wish i would have gotten the original leappad or perhaps even the leapster. for one thing the book doesn't recognize all pencil movements. a child could make an incorrect number or letter and it doesn't seem that the leappad would recognize it. also the child has to keep erasing over and over providing limited usage. not only that there are only a few books published with leappad writing in mind and the exercises are repetitive (e.g. writing the number 6 ten times). i've bought quite a few leappad books and quantum pad books for my son and he is just not interested after initial use. i'm sure he's learned a little bit of phonics using the phonics books and such but i think he learns more from workbooks bought at a bookstore or a department store--and they're cheaper! not only that leappad books are very short...much shorter than workbooks you can buy. considering that leappad books are usually around $15 a pop--and that amazon doesn't carry/list them all and there is a very limited selection in stuff mart-type stores (at least that's the case in my geographical area)--you may want to re-consider investing in the leappad system.

" this car pictured could be a base or first version defintely not worth 299.00 these are going for 100.00 and less on the web. if you havent noticed the differences in the packaging it wouldnt suprise me. lots of people dont notice. heres the differences below... on these 5 cars there is two versions of each driver(5 different drivers) that were made. first versions or base version and second versions or added features version. the first versions have no added features stickers and you cannot race any two (or more) cars of the 5 different drivers' cars at the same time! dale sr. and dale jr. jeff gordon jimmie johnson and tony stewart cars of the first versions (no added features) cannot race together! transmitter frequencys cannot be changed. speed and steering are straight function. (no varilable anything) they either turn right full turn or left full turn or it goes straight. speed is either it goes full on or it doesnt. same for reverse gear. again each of the 5 different drivers' cars made are two different versions of the same car one has more features than the other. updated or added features versions have added features stickers. those added features are... digital proportional steering (variable steering) which means you can turn the transmitter wheel slightly and the car turns a little. turn the transmitter wheel alot and the car turns alot. variable speed control this means you pull back on the trigger a little the car moves a little pull back on the trigger all the way and the car takes off! this also works for reverse gears as well now if this isnt cool enough... each added features car has different frequencies for different drivers' car. the transmitters for the cars are different as well. added features version transmitter has two trim adjustments on the back of the remote as well as the frequency chip on the side of the remote than can be changed and can also be changed on the chassis of the car. so if you own 2 of the tony stewart cars you would have to have a frequency pack to race them at the same time. now two or more different drivers' cars can race together (or five people can race 5 different cars). no two alike cars can race together unless you have the frequency of another car and transmitter to change it or a frequency pack from team up inc. all 5 frequency chips do not come with the car in the box off the shelf. this frequency pack is sold seperately! you can also purchase tires suspension parts and body hold down clips fully painted and ready to use new spare or other drivers' teams bodies extra rechargeable battery packs seperately! i have done lots of research on these cars and should you have any questions please ask...nascarnbroncosfans@msn.co ",negative

" after reading the other reviews of this product i felt confident enough to go ahead and buy it as a gift for an 8 year old boy. he is learning multiplication tables now so i figured this was a great present. unfortunately once the batteries were in it kept malfunctioning and when the dials were twisted to 2 numbers it would read out two totally different numbers and give their result instead of the 2 numbers the dials showed. we tried over and over to get it to work but it is a dud! i live overseas so returning it is not an option i am willing to pay the extra freight/duty for. i bought another leap frog product at the same time that i have not given as a present yet i really hope it works ",negative

" our daughter became this as she was a baby. we tried several time during her past 2 years if she would reach a moment to like it but she always wanted to go out after 1 or 2 minutes. maybe other babies are diferent but i think its not the right material for such a playground. for a hot environment like ours in the south it quickly gets very hot inside and you can not leave your baby or little child alone playing because of the plastic material that can be dangerous. we finally sealed the holes on the bottom and do not pump up the upper part so we fill it with water and use it as a litle pool thats the only way for us to use it ",negative

" i agree with all of the other reviews about this tent and its durability however my daughter absolutely loves it. first the three plastic sticks that come with the tent to hold it open broke and warped pretty quick. i went to home depot and bought three wooden dowels for 79 cents each and cut them to the correct length and it works great. my daughter uses this mostly inside and it is fine when outside the wind and everything else did move it around. i bought a 4 pack of plastic tent stakes from target for about $1 and put one in each corner to hold it in place works great. i think we paid $19 for this at target and it definitely seems worth the amount of enjoyment my daughter gets. if you are expecting a $200 high quality camping tent you will probably be disappointed ",negative

" if one good thing can be said about dread pirate it's that the physical game components reek of quality. the cloth game board glass jewels metal coins wooden dice and pewter game pieces all come together to give an overall sense of realism to the game. it's a pity however that the game itself isn't nearly as exciting as the pieces. dread pirate relies entirely on random dice rolls to determine every single outcome of the game. to move from place to place you roll dice. to challenge another player to a skirmish (which is how you steal their treasure) you roll dice. to steal jewels from an enemy's port you roll dice. to trade for jewels at a port you roll dice. there's absolutely no semblance of any real strategy in this game. you win by accumulating the most treasure and the amount of treasure you accumulate depends entirely on how lucky you are in your roll of the dice. this game is not fun and can even be frustrating especially for a young child who keeps rolling low numbers. there's some thinking involved... you need to judge for yourself who you should attack and when but even if you make the best possible strategic decision you can still lose the die roll and end up empty-handed. i would recommend dread pirate only if your family is specifically looking for a game where you don't have to think and only if your children are mature enough to deal with bad luck (as good/bad luck is the only way to win/lose this game). if you're looking for an enjoyable family game that everyone can play i would very much reccommend cranium over this. it's less expensive there's alot more to it and it will have your family getting up being active and laughing out loud (instead of sitting around and rolling dice to determine the number of jewels you can take) ",negative

" normally i am a big fan of the little tikes name but not so with this product. i bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and although the concept is cute it is not like other little tikes products. to begin with the train frequently comes off the track. also to activate it you must press the button where the conductor goes. however it is difficult for my daughter to place the figure on this spot without it falling off. she often presses the button in the process which activates the train while she is still trying to put the figure on it which frustrates her. since this is geared for toddlers you would think that little tikes would have put the button to activate the motion in a different spot from where the figures go. also at age 2 1/2 she is quickly bored with it. she has more fun letting it go on the floor across the room than riding on the track. needless to say it is going back. the only good feature is that you can pack it and go for away from home fun ",negative

" the bar is nice and i suppose the mat will come in handy for reviewing the basic positions. but the dvd... it's just awful. the music is painfully bad. seriously what dp little girls dressed like fruit have to do with ballet? and the host is a confusing choice: her accent is distracting and it's made even worse by the fact that she's talking around braces. the two little girls who help her don't look much happier. in fact the one on the left looks like someone told her to smile or else. trying to keep up with the nominally enducational dvd is harder than you might think as the mat has two sides and you have to flip it over mid-stream only you get no warning and no time to do it. and the positions are introduced too quickly and with no discussion; they're just lyrics to the annoying song. our daughter got this for her 3rd birthday and she actually looked at me the first time we watched it and said i want the fruit to go away. i had to laugh out loud and tell her i did too! overall i'm sorry her grandparents spent $15 on this. total disappointment ",negative

" what a disappointment! we got this for my daughter because of the enticing tv commercials that make it appear to be fun moldable and not messy. however it is none of those and is very messy! it is just a cross between dust and sand and not fun to play with or to clean up. it stays on your hands and a child can easily wipe their eyes and cause problems. go with play-doh or floam instead ",negative

" this obviously is a re-release of the old empire strikes back kit released in the 80's. a decent size kit (approx 15 inches) it gives an experience modeler a good opportunity at super detailing. the kit is relatively easy to build out of the box but it has many inaccuracies most notably the inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector dome on top of the ship. these inaccuracies can be addressed by looking in the internet for replacement parts and articles on addressing those inaccuracies. however the kit is worth the price. my only disappointment is the kit is not in scale with the new republic star destroyer from revenge of the sith. the new kit for the new movie is over 19 inches long. in order for this kit to be in scale with the current movie version it would need to be about 24 inches long. hopefully someone will make the imperial star destroyer to that scale.

" we finally bought these barbie magic of the rainbow dolls for our 4-year-old twin daughters after hearing them beg for it repeatedly after each time the commercial aired. at first they were very excited to play with them. positives: the doll is durable. it encourages participants to follow instructions. negatives: i notice my daughters have to wave the doll a few times before the dvd hears the instructions. positives: the dvd provides clear and easy to understand directions so your doll can be programmed with your remote control. negatives: the doll set off our fire alarm a few times before we figured out it was the doll (and we did check to see if there really was a fire!) when the dvd is not in the dolls control the volume on the tv! this can be very annoying when the volume increases just as you realize your daughters have started playing with the dolls. my suggestion: de-program the doll when your kids are finished playing the dvd! or just keep it deprogrammed and use your remote -taking all control away from your kids and keeping them from standing so close to the tv ",negative

" the item arrived to us the week of christmas three weeks after we had ordered it. it arrived with several broken and several missing parts. amazon would not send us new parts they would only replace the unit if we shipped it back first. this was to be a christmas gift to my son so that was not optional. had the order arrived when the order tracking said it would i would have had time to return it ",negative

" i'm not sure how this toy ended up with a 4.5 star rating after all the broken microphones!! ours was yet another that broke within 2 months of gentle play. it wasn't thrown or dragged around by the microphone or anything of the sort. my son loved it and figured out the microphone very quickly. he loved to see the lights and the little puppy dance when he sang into the microphone. i continued to let him play with it even after the microphone shorted out and the static began and he still kept trying the microphone until he got frustrated and then i finally put it away. i wish i had spent the money on something that would have lasted longer. my son is now 18 months old and the only other toy he has ever managed to break was the vtech nursery farm which was broken 3 weeks after christmas last year just before this piano broke. i highly recommend fisher price or leapfrog toys over vtech. we have never had a problem with their toys and 2 of the 3 vtech toys we have owned have broken on us. garbage!

" i was really excited about this toy. i was very forgetful when it came to putting my son on his tummy so i thought this would be a great toy for him to have some good quality tummy time on. wrong. he could care less about this toy. the second i'd lay him in front of it he would just roll onto his back. he was five months old when we bought it and it is just sitting there. he still loves his gymini and he is six months old now. also by the third day the aquarium had sprung a leak..which apparently has happened to almost everyone who has bought this thing. do not purchase this toy it takes up too much space and it's a waste of money. baby could care less about it ",negative
" when we bought this i liked the versatility it offered. i quickly noticed however that it is mostly good for strewing the soft pieces everywhere. there are actually too many pieces to keep up with and frankly i'm getting sick of stepping on the cow. my 6 mos old likes it for a couple minutes until he's rolled away from it. my 3 year old thinks it's interesting but she just ends up taking it apart and the pieces end up all over the place. after a couple days of playing with it i usually put most of it away and keep out only a couple parts to complement our other toys. the water play mat lasted until my 3 year old stepped on it once or twice. then that was gone ",negative
" i thought this toy looked fantastic as i was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew. the versitility of this one looks great. well i liked it more than either one of my children did as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom! the black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that it just got taken apart and lost its interest no matter which way i arranged the peices. infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads ",negative
" i bought this item for my newborn - thinking it would grow with him and be useful for at least the 1st year. i was so wrong. first as i feared the water fishbowl leaked the 1st time i filled it. i returned it and the next one leaked as well. then the mirror is one of those plastic mirrors that gives a distorted reflection - which was of no value or interest to my son. the cow that makes noise died after less than a month of light to no use. finally the toy just didn't have that fun value that a $43 toy should have. he hated it - never attempted to crawl down it never played with the features. save your money - this toy is of poor quality and poor entertainment value. there are tons of better products out there..

" our family loves all types of memory games and this is the most attractive. the colorful stripes on the back are great the pictures are good the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box. my only negative comment is that there is no indication which country each child represents. the children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together...i think it is an obvious teaching opportunity. in fact i would like to know this myself ",negative
" the dolls and outfits in this set are adorable and the case was a cute idea. the only problem that kept me from giving this item a high star rating is the case itself. i wish the case closed more tightly it closes with a small gap along the sides also the entire case lid keeps coming off easily. overall tho aside from the annoyance of the lid for the price it was still worth purchasing because as i've said the dolls and outfits are so adorable and a great addition to my 8yr old daughters polly collection.

" my husband and i have ignored many poor reviews in choosing toys for our 18-month old and have often been pleasantly surprised to see our son thoroughly enjoying such toys. unfortunately this was not the case with the peg perego thomas ride-on train. he is exceptionally tall and strong for his age yet there is no way his hand could possibly depress the button required to keep the train moving much less hold it down for any length of time. so the operation of the train requires an adult to depress the button and spin in circles while your child bats your hand away and is totally distracted from the experience. my son enjoys pushing the train along the track more than riding it. however the train is flimsy and easily comes off the track so this usually lasts a few seconds before he is again frustrated and annoyed. all this and then you need to get out the screwdriver to charge the battery every time you play with it. don't buy this toy or you will be kicking yourselves like we are. it's a gimmicky piece of plastic junk that even major thomas-lovers will probably not enjoy. ",negative
" the start button is too difficult for even a three year old to hold down. the battery is tedious to re-charge (required after every use!). dangerous. when child leans slightly to the side the entire engine will turn over. for all your time and money you will only see a child with a bored expression - or a frustrated child who can't operate start button alone. you could tape down the button and then the child must ask for you to stop it. total supervision required any way you look at it. a real expensive gimicky toy! ",negative
" i was so disappointed with this item. my son (who's 3) received this for his bday. the child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son couldn't do it. he ended up getting so frustrated he broke down in tears! the noises the train makes are much too loud! and you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track which we do not have. i was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it's a peg perego. the manufacturers should've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it. why couldn't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones? i put it back in the box and back to the store it went.

" my five and half year old daughter asked for this particular barbie doll. she was so happy when she opened her present and found mermaidia elina doll. she took it out of the box and started to play with it. soon enough she lost interest however. the wings are large so large they are actually a burden. placing the doll inside the mermaid tail is not easy for little hands either. all in all this doll is just make-up if you see what i mean. pretty but not easy to play with and easily forgotten. she is on a stand in my daiughter's room and hasn't been touched or played with since christmas morning... not worth the price ",negative

" my son (now 4) loves cars so when i saw this bed frame i thought this is it! well looks can fool you. i also read many glowing reviews about this bed frame so i was confident that this was a must buy. but after using it for a while (1 year now) i am very disappointed. if i would buy another bed frame this one would not be in my shopping list. what i and all my family don't like about this frame : 1. the front end of the car frame is shaped like a sports car so people hit that protruding part all the time when walking in the room making people falter sometimes. 2. since it is made of plastic it gets really cold and it really feels terrible. i don't know why it is damn cold all the time. 3. i had to exchange the regular-height box spring for a half-height one because the regular-height box spring would be too high and the sides of the bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling. 4. so many toys and things fall between the mattress and the bed frame. i have to lift the damn mattress and then go into the car frame to pick up all the junk that my son loves to shove into the little openings. 5. i think the bed frame takes up way too much space for a twin sized bed. it is waste of space. 6. my son was disappointed that the wheels don't spin. and i think he has a point since this bed frame costs so much. my son now don't even think it's a cool thing. well he stopped liking the bed only after a few days. 7. the head part of the bed is also plastic and for some reason your head can go under that plastic because that head part comes over the mattress. it is quite annoying and we had to put another pillow to cover that part of the frame. and you can't even use it as a shelf since it is not flat. dolls and little toys that we put up there would slide down to hit our son or slide to the sides and fall into the corner where there is a big opening between the walls and the car frame. 8. again it is very very cold and it really feels terrible when you want to sleep at night and everything around you is so cold and hard. this is a miserable bed and i feel bad that i bought this horrible bed for my loving son. we are gonna sell it for 100 dollars (we hope) in the summer. the only reason for giving 2 stars is because it is very solid ",negative

" my daughter plays with an older round version sit and spin at daycare alot. all the kids like it there. she got the simon says version for christmas from her aunt and it pretty much sucks. she tried to play with it every once in a while but got so frustrated we have now just put it the attic because she won't touch it and it was in the way. it doesn't spin very well at all (possibly due to the oval shape??) no matter where my daughter sits on it. also the audio is very loud and annoying with no volume control. also it seems much cheaper made than the older style she plays with at daycare. i would say don't waste your money on the simon says sit n spin - try to find an older one at a second hand store or garage sale. my recommendation to playskool would be to go back to the original design - a round sit n spin no sound - just pure and simple fun ",negative
" i can see from reading the below reviews that i'm not the only one who hates this thing. what a total waste! i got it for my little one remembering how much i (and every other kid i've ever known) loved this toy. well this version has been made too safe to have any fun on. it barely spins. if you want your toddler to develop amazing upper body strength then force them to work out on this thing a couple times a day. it's almost impossible to spin and you never get up any momentum at all. not to mention the loud loud music with no volume control. which i could deal with if the thing was any fun at all ",negative
" we bought this gadget for our 2-year old. to risk sounding like a broken record--or faulty spinning plastic toy in this case--i'll just add my vote to the design flaws: 1. volume. not only is the volume loud it's unbearably so. even my daughter grabs her ears when she's playing on it. the voice is a bit garbled as well so when the command 'ready..spin!' sounds more like 'wordy...spew!' i prefer to spare my daughter's hearing loss for live concerts in her teenage years so i've disabled the on/off switch. 2. spin quality. a sit n' spin should have a fluid effortless motion (like a lazy susan). this toy requires enormous effort to turn. to add to my daughter's frustation the handle's base gives a bit (even with screws tightly fastened) making for a tedious experience rather than the joy ride we loved as kids. spare the expense and the frustration of fitting this thing in the garbage can on collection day--buy an easel and finger paint kit instead.

" my two year old absolutely would not leave the store without this and she still plays with it a year later. however there are two problems. one it immediately needed repair to the basic connections and two it has a pinching hazard between the basket and the frame. but of course my daughter never noticed either of those. she simply loves to play with it constantly and has to take it on walks around the block ",negative

" a friend of mine has zombies!!! also by twilight creations. i've played it a few times and found it pretty enjoyable. zombietown is sort of a followup to this in some ways and tries to expand the strategy of the game somewhat. unfortunately it ends up far too confusing and complicated to make for fast gameplay (it's often very slow in fact) and the strategy is more shallow than risk. ya know the stereotypically confusing instructions of insert tab a into slot b? that's pretty much what the instructions to this read like. they're fairly poorly written to boot. there were also a couple problems we ran into the rules didn't seem to cover. i can't recall them off the top of my head and they didn't come up very often but it was still irritating. overall definetly not reccomended. at $40 in stores and $35 off amazon it's also a huge ripoff. what do you get in the box? like 100 tiny army men-esque figures a couple of packs of cards and a laminated piece of cardboard. i understand why it is expensive as i'm sure this was a low budget item and such but zombies!!! was much less expensive.

" we bought this dollhouse because when we went to the store it had an adorable display and looked like a step up from the twintime dollhouse which has very small rooms. you could press the button on the display and the people would talk to each other. my kids thought it would be great. when we were at toys r us i looked for accessory furniture/people/animal sets to go along with this dollhouse. i did not see any. i thought it was probably due to christmas just having passed. we got home opened the dollhouse and discovered that there really were not many phrases that the provided people/furnitureanimal did so i went to amazon to try to find more sets in order to achieve the purpose of this dollhouse (to get the 200 phrases). thats when reality set in that we had just made a huge mistake. you cannot find any accesory pieces for this set. you can go on ebay and pay many times more than the original price for used furniture. i was really disappointed. i even tried the fisher price website only to find that they are marketing the twintime dollhouse furniture for this sweet sounds dollhouse. what a shame and a sham.... i really like fisher price toys and we have many but i am very disappointed in the fact that they are trying to fool the consumer. what good is a dollhouse if you cannot get it to accomplish what it says it will do---200 phrases. not to mention what is included with the sweet sounds dollhouse is not much. just a mom dad girl baby swing cradle radio cat and a scant few more pieces. definately not enough to keep the kids interested for long! there are actually three fisher price dollhouses that are still available this one the twintime dollhouse and the one we eventually ended up buying at value city (also available on ebay)--the fisher price special edition townhouse. it has a doorbell that rings doors that open birds that sing phone that rings lights that come on fridge light comes on computer lights up(and is part of a desk set attached to the dollhouse) and a fireplace that crackles and lights up (which is also attached to the dollhouse). these things are all on the dollhouse itself. no accesory furniture or people are needed to make this happen. the battery replacement compartment is on the back on this dollhouse not the bottom like the sweet sounds one. the front of the townhouse has flower boxes with likelike flowers you place in them (comes with the set). you can get it a lot cheaper than the sweet sounds dollhouse too (almost half the cost). it comes with a great deal of furniture: 2 beds with pillows and comforters and blankets a lawnchair 3 people potted plant real curtains kitchen table and chairs clothing for the people computer chair lounge chair and more. the kitchen counter stove microwave and fridge are part of the dollhouse. it also has closet doors that open and stairs the people can walk up. you practically do not need to buy anything else but if you do you can get the loving family accesory people and furniture sets. this dollhouse is so much larger to boot. there is plenty of room to put everything. it shuts and closes together just like the sweet sounds but it is clearly larger. we also thought about the twintime but it had too many comments on how small the rooms were and the display at toys r us looked jammed packed. i did not know how more than one child could play with it and not have a shoving match because they could not play as well. my kids absolutely the townhouse with all of its sounds especially the doorbell. the great thing about it is that these are greatly reduced in price because they are an older model which is what they should do with the sweet sounds dollhouse. let the public know ahead of time so their kids do not get disappointed because it does not live up to what it says at the store. thank goodness i was able to take mine back because i had my receipt and box. be careful and keep the box and receipt if you do choose to buy this dollhouse even after all of the warnings because after your kids see that it does not do what it says and because it is on the small side compared with the townhouse version they may not want to keep it. when we took ours back a toys r us worker stopped and talked to us and agreed that fisher price is just trying to get rid of their extra stock of sweet sounds dollhouses. unfortunately it is at the consumers expense and disappointment!!

" i bought this for my 5 year old daughter for christmas. she played the sound game. she always got the answer correct but 60-70% of the time the bear still said it was incorrect. the rest of the family tried it and it did the same thing. therefore this is not a learning toy and it is no fun. after trying a few times and the bear telling my daughter she was incorrect when she actually was she decided she hated the thing and didn't ever want to play with it again. i took the thing back to the store and got a refund ",negative
" i bought this with high hopes of getting a well modeled vehicle. it took about only ten minutes to put together and it comes with general greivous!!! but the legs are really weird. i wasted $20.00 dollars at a local super target i could have got a star wars video game or a few figs..... i just like adding it to my collection. but if you have the obi-wan with boga put them together like i did. the star wars saga has introduced some really good toys i am just saying that this toy is fairly good. not a favorite. i suggest it to a collecter only........ i love the line of e3 collectables. they really rock. i suggest this because it is okay in the stage of durable and fun. star wars e3 general greivous' wheel bike is a great toy i hope people should think about buying ",negative
" this is more for a kid who is 4 or 5 years old not 8-11 as it states. talk about a waste of money. i returned this the next day for a refund as my 10 year old daughter would have been so upset with me had she received this under the christmas tree this year. it was a shame the description wasn't more accurate because i was not refunded my expedited shipping costs i paid for this toy thumbs dow ",negative
" just what the world needs another clone of the worst board game ever to sell like hotcakes. i can not think of any reason to recommend this game. the winner is determined by luck there is no skill involved in winning this or any game of monopoly. the game hardly fits into a single evening of play and for a few unlucky players who exit early that means either sitting around watching or finding something else to do (this may be a blessing if it means not playing anymore). so to anyone who is buying this to play it (not because you are a huge dog fan and must own everything that has a dog on it) i recommend that you look into a better product. i would start by going to google and searching on board game. follow the 1st link you find ",negative

" i bought this for my pony-obsessed daughter for christmas mostly because it was the only way to get the breezie zipzee (one of the main breezies in the new movies). thank goodness i wasn't expecting much out of this toy after reading reviews on the other playsets because it didn't even last a day! after i assembled the braiding handle and my daughter quickly learned how to operate it herself she came out not an hour later in tears because it had fallen apart. not the handle you snap on mind you. that was still firmly attatched. the rest of the mechanism had more or less disintegrated as she used it! fortunately she gets enough use out of zipzee and daffidaisy that it wasn't too much of a loss that i had to throw it away only hours after opening the box. so unless you're really after zipzee or daffidaisy don't waste your money on this junky thing that could potentially be a choking hazaard for younger siblings. horrible!!

" i bought this as a christmas present for my 4-year-old daughter. she is a huge my little pony fan. ponyville lives in our house in fact. we got it out and played with it for a couple hours. we didn't have the problems described with the hand crank. that seems to be very durable. the problem is with the flower that zippee goes in. a pony steps on the flower to open the flower and then you wind the gear counter clockwise to close it. after a couple hours the flower petals are now broken and can't be repaired. toys certainly don't have the quality in them that they used to. hasbro's quality in general has declined. this was demonstrated in the newest my little pony castle as well. this toy has some neat features. the crank works well and the braiding mechanism is useful. the breezie that lives in the flower goes along with the story in the my little pony video series. the colors are vivid and bright. i would have liked to suggest that the pink stage that the daffidazey stands on should have had built-in storage to hold the hair accessories. some additional clips would also have been a nice addition to this set. 4 clips for a set that is designed to do all your ponies' hair is a bit skimpy. the braids are nice and tight and even a young child can operate this toy....with a bit of assistance. (hint: putting suction cups or velcro hook and loop on the bottom makes it even easier for little ones to play with minimal adult assistance) ",negative
" worst product ever. i really trust crayola but am having doubts after these new outdoor products. theyre just terrible- made shotty- they dont work.. i am very disappointed. this spins so fast that none of the paint comes out- then it just pours out in a big wet mess. just awful ",negative
" we bought this for my daughter for her birthday. like the previous reviewer we also didn't realize we needed to dilute the paint first. even with the paint diluted properly it doesn't really work as expected. you have to wait for the paint to drip down to the bottom of the tube and then turn the spinner on. even then only a bit of paint comes out and you have to turn it off and wait for more to drip down. i plan on returning this toy for a refund as well.

" i bought this product for my children because it looked neat! what they don't tell you is that the paint must be diluted before you can use it (why not include the pre-diluted paint? but i digress....). even after thinning the paint the product hardly spins. if we could get it to work it seemed like a neat concept. but it just doesn't work. i have no idea if it is because it needs very thin paint or the motor is weak or what. we returned ours for a refund ",negative

" my stepmom bought a set of these for each of my three kids ages 12 9 and 6. all i have to say is do not buy these!!!! my six year old did great on the first page but as the other reviewer said the film gets all over the markers. we even tried washing them off and it did no good. also when my 6 year old was coloring he would rest his arm on the bottom of the page and when he would pick it up it would be covered in black. bottom line about 30 minutes after they got them my kids arms and faces were covered in black smudges as were my hands somewhat just from holding their pictures to look at them. messy messy messy. my 12 year old finally just went and stuck one of the papers under running water and washed off all the black to see the neon underneath and this proved to be the least messy but least rewarding way to do it. good idea bad execution. my kids who are crazy for any kind of arts and crafts hated these things. save your money and buy regular papers and markers and crayons ",negative
" my son loves the color wonder line by crayola so when i saw that they came out with a new creation called color explosion which is another marker-type of product i knew i had to try it. now i wish i'd saved my money. first off you should know this product is not for preschoolers. color explosion is recommended for children 6-years and up. now that i've played with it i concur. i came upon this product when arrangements were made to watch my 9 and 10-year old nieces for a week. i thought the color explosion would be a hit and i planned to treat them with this art related project throughout the week. they were excited to try it and once i settled monkey boy my 5-year old with a project of his own we got started. at first glance it looked to be a winner. the girls were having fun. then we started another page and the markers became icky. gummy is probably a better description. the markers were covered with a black film which caused the images to look splotchy and streaky. crayola suggests you wipe the markers off with a paper towel so we did. it kept happening. for instance we'd draw a short line and then we'd have to wipe the film off again. then we tried to wipe off the images with a paper towel. that didn't help either. color explosion is too painstaking for a child's activity. we began to realize that it wasn't a blast but a bummer. crayola warns against moisture but even fingerprints will spear the pages and the film comes off onto your hands the table and everything else. oh and if you use the glitter set it clumps and mixes with the film and makes a liquidy black goo that stains fabrics. the company warns about staining and suggests washing immediately but come on. did they even test market this product? what i thought would be an entertaining venture turned out to be a messy disappointment.

" i bought this toy along with mr. incredible for my son's birthday. he loves the movie and was very excited to get these toys. unfortanitly they lasted all of five minutes before syndromes head fell off and mr. incredibles hand broke off. after that i had to deal with a crying kid. if you want the toy just to look at then it is good but if you buy it for your childdon't expect it to last long ",negative
" to start with the description of this kit is false. there are not 75 pieces... only 11. the detail is very very poor... large soft-edged raised blocks with only the vaguest resemblance to the death star as seen in the films. you'd honestly be better off starting with a smooth plastic ball & making a death star from scratch rather than buying this kit. ",negative
" as star wars kits go it's better than most. ertl should have spent more time on the molds and getting the details right. the kit while having very few parts is not a novice kit. it has fit issues and badly &#65279;mis-aligned parts. the upper and lower fuselages do not mate well and the solar panels do not align well with the hull. the solar panels tend to cant to the rear not setting in line with the fuse. it's a case of both of the parts the solar panels and the fuselage being out of alinement. much work is needed to get the solar panels to aline with the hull and the mounting pylons. one bright spot is the well defined engraved panel lines and the small details. the upper hatch and cockpit glass is the clearest of the star wars kits i have built. it's better than the x-wing and other fighters and is as good in the detail department as the at-at. having not built the rare tie fighter kit i cannot say how it rate against it. once the fit problems are dealt with and a good paint job is applied it makes a good display but it requires some modeling experience to get it to look as it should. the stand is not sturdy enough for the weight of the model. i suggest a clear plastic rod and a wooden base ",negative
" this product is a box o' junk. my son got this for christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it. the hat fell apart within three days (and he hardly played with it - just wore it on his head a few times) - the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat which is obviously dangerous. i contacted the company and they have not responded.

" the barbie plug and play 12 dancing princesses thing is a joke. my daughter only wanted that for christmas for three months. after the one on christmas morning did not function at all the second one was so terrible that she gave up after two days. the graphics are straight from 1981 and the dancing princesses even make roboty bendy noises as they move. very strange and disappointing ",negative

" i have to agree with the other on here. i got this for my 5yr for christmas and she seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now it sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it. i was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead. i tried and didn't think it was all that fun either. i threw the box away and i'm sure i need that to return it. if i could i would get her something else in return that she could use ",negative

" this was very dissapointing!! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it. the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade. the mat looks like it comes from the dollar store or they ran out of color at the factory. my daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one....not like the box or commercial!

" santa gave this to our daughter this year. i am thoroughly disappointed with it. we put the batteries in and started it up. after reading the how to part the graphics are terrible. i had to prompt her to which flower to step on not that that was necessary. the princesses started dancing without stepping on the flower it just made a funny sound. the dancers go fast and fuzzy. you can't tell for sure what the foot work is doing for the ballroom steps. i even went on the mat and tried. my daughter lasted all of about five minutes and was done. i hope santa will take this back ",negative
" my daughter just received this as a christmas gift. she was so excited. my husband and mother-in-law went to the tv to install it. 15 minutes later my five year old is in tears. i wish this had been reviewed before we purchased. the graphics are terrible. this will be going back to the store. glad i still have the receipt.

" like many overhead gym type toys this one turns out to be for short or legless babies. when my daughter kicks the kickplates she kicks the toy right away from her (and this is on carpet) and when we brace the toy against something she kicks herself right out from under the toy. we have found the same to be true for a number of similarly designed toys. now that we have looked at the box more closely the baby in the picture has his/her legs bent really hard in order for the baby to fit under the toy. our daughter is 3 1/2 months old and is already too big for this. on a positive note this is a very well made toy in all other respects. looks durable as are all chicco toys and the music and lights are pleasant. another negative: you apparently have to push the two hanging toys to get them to activate sound and lights and most babies want to pull them. might be good for a tummy toy but we're not waiting for that--we'll try the chicco 3 in 1 gym instead as it appears to be a much better bang for the buck and does not have a kick plate ",negative

" it's christmas day and believe me the only thing that would get me to sit down at a computer is the level of dissatisfaction i've had with the thomas battery powered engines. these trains derail constantly. i think it is because all four wheels have power and the front wheels have too much traction so they are able to climb out of the grooves. took me all night to set up a really cool track and they derail every 40 seconds or so. read: 3 year old yelling at train. thank goodness i also bought a brio battery powered engine as well (the polar express one). it works much better. it has not derailed once all morning. it also is better in the following ways: 1) it shuts off after 2 minutes so you don't lose battery power 2) it can go into freewheel mode when you want to use it without power 3) it goes in reverse 4) it makes train sounds 5) the coupling to other cars has a swivel which means it is less likely to derail and more likely to maintain the magnetic connection 6) it comes with batteries installed. if santa claus had not disposed of all the packaging last night i would return all the battery operated thomas trains and go with brio ones. note: there is a good thomas battery powered car which is the jet engine. this jet engine has the swivel and seems not to derail maybe because it pushes the other cars in front of it ",negative
" this kit is very poorly detailed and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close. there's a much better model of an x-wing out there. do a web search for a company called fine molds... it's a japanese company that makes a finely-detailed 1/72 scale x-wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures including parts to build different ships from the original film's death star battle including standing & seated pilot figures & different droid types. it's a bit more expensive than this kit but you get what you pay for.

" i picked this item up for my 6 year old nephew who loves science. we put it together one night and i was surprised to find that the base and volcano are incredibly thin plastic that crack under any pressure at all. the plaster/sand mixture was impossible to work with it just balled up into clumps and there was no real way of spreading it around smoothly. we both ended up with plaster all over us. once it had dried he was excited to get to paint it. as soon as he began to paint parts of the plaster started breaking off in chunks. hooking the plastic tubing up was not a major problem but i had issues keeping it hooked together. the pump system was supposed to send vinegar into a baking soda chamber to push up into the volcano. instead the pump (which was a squeeze bottle) pushed the vinegar weakly upwards and then once it hit the baking soda chamber it clogged up. when it finally made its way out through the volcano after me squeezing the bottle as hard as possible it barely trickled out. once it had trickled enough the rest of the plaster fell off as it got wet. he and his sisters just looked at me and asked is that it? after three tries we trashed the whole thing. also the rock samples that they give you in the kit are the size of the tip of your fingernail. i'm a geologist and these are not rare expensive rocks. there was no reason to not include larger samples. he was very disappointed in the whole thing and so was i. i can't believe that the smithsonian put their name on this product. we'll go back to our plaster volcano with vinegar and baking soda ",negative

" as others have stated the dvd mini-games are nearly impossible to play due to wonky controls. i also have no idea what the cards or pieces are for other then they may come into play if you win the main game. they should have just done a choose your own adventure type game. it would have been less high-tech but you could at least have a laugh when you choose set up a perimeter and the terrorists once again escape. do not buy ",negative

" this game was put together with a nice concept be a ctu agent and help jack bauer stop the terrorist attack. also i liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game. however the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well. though you try to do what it tells you to do it doesn't seem to work. since these interactive parts are so simple yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end. i had three college students and two adults try it adn no one could seem to get it to work correctly. so if some bugs were worked out this game could be a much bigger success ",negative
" sure wish my mother-in-law had read these reviews before giving this to me for christmas. tried to play it once with my parents who are also big 24 fans a few nights later and were sorely disappointed. this game was obviously just shoved out the door to feed off the popularity of 24 the show and not to garner any popularity in its own right. the mini-games were an exercise in extreme frustration. the problem is that the dvd is not ideal for those mini-games. whenever you try to move there are only two subsequent animations: the successful one and the unsuccessful one which made it seem like it was just moving at random. other than that it seemed like the game was going to be pretty linear the clue cards contained no useful information and the board completely superfluous unless apparently you are masochistic enough to get to the bonus level ",negative

" i bought this game hoping to have another great game for my girlfriend and i (we became bored playing backgammon all the time) and we are disappointed. this game has nothing to do with any lost cities.... it's just a card game that requires you to stack cards in numeric order to get points... you group the cards by color (which are supposed to represent cities????) and eventually the game ends after a certain number of cards are played and you tally up a bunch of numbers divide that by pi and then take the square root of you birth year and multiply that by five to see if you have either earned points or need to subtract them. then you do the math for your partner. we tried to play it a few times and it was just kinda dumb.... (the points arn't that difficult really!) but this game was a waste of time and twenty some odd dollars. i suggest you take the $20 and buy a bottle of hooch and have some real fun with your partner... unless you are 8 years old... in which case this game might be fun. just terrible ",negative

" i bought this barbie after seeing two pictures of angel barbies on the website and reading the manufacturer's description. one picture seems to have been deleted now. the manufacturer's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash. i trusted that the manufacturer's description which matched one of the pictures was the correct angel. the doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all. it is very simple with vinyl wings. be aware of which you are purchasing the description is deceptive and incorrect ",negative
" my wife and i purchased the videonow xp interactive video system for my son this christmas however when we did walmart was out of the headphones. well i was on amazon one day and decided to look here. i ordered them and was seriously disappointed when they arrived. my 5 year old son attempted to put them on and all they did was fall to his shoulders. no matter how we tried that is all they would do. my 12 year old daughter decided to try them with her mp3 player with the same result! i am able to wear them however even with my 30 year old head (size 8 1/4) it is still loose. these are not adjustable which of course makes things all the worse. i would just go ahead and pick up some other company's aftermarket headphones for your child. if tiger reads the reviews of their products at all then they need to ensure that they rethink the engineering of this device ",negative

" ummm...i am a huge fan of bratz but this piece of junk is absolutely terrible. first of all the eyes are super ugly. i can't believe they would make such an ugly product! the lips are fine. but i could reconsider by making better cuter eyes! they broke when i had it after five minutes. they do not blink. they try to but don't succeed. do not buy!! second the features are horrible. they are made so bad i tried to make it walk since it couldn't on it's won! it does not walk. note that. also it's head does not move. it was broken on mine and it made it fall down and the neck while trying to move muffled the song. also unless you wanna hear the same 20 second bratz catz song over and over again do not buy this product. it will dissapoint your daughter like it did to me. i am the daughter but am very dissapointed. i have returned mine and did not get a new one either. i got some bratz babyz which were cuter than this junk! i am warning you this cat is brainwashed and should not be continued. do not buy this product unless you want a crying daughter for it!!! thank you for your patience and gratuity in reading this grievance. love brownie baby doll lover. get babies instead they're cute!

" we looked for a trash truck that our 4 year old boy could play with. on the surface the bruder looked the part. not as cartoon-looking as some the fact that it looked like a real trash truck but had few obvious breakable parts made it seem like an ideal choice. actual play testing though shows this product isn't very well-built at least not enough to withstand normal wear and tear. this truck wasn't subjected to being thrown down the stairs jumped on etc. it's been just played with but it started coming apart quickly. the hinged door in the back of the truck is a poor design. the plastic hinges on the truck are too thin and break easily. the plastic hinges on the door start to bend after multiple open/closes and the plastic weakens and breaks off. the hinged front compartment and rear sections are difficult to operate and stick easily. items put into the cab (like the essential green army man who drives the truck) easily get caught in here and are very difficult to remove. worse though is the key point of this toy the ability to latch the trash can to the lifting/dumping mechanism. this is way to complex for a child and the intricacy in getting a solid connect is difficult even for an adult. if it's not hooked up right the can falls off when you try to lift it; very frustrating. some little pieces (rear view mirror etc) broke off easily and early on but we kind of expected this. the parts were simply too small and fragile to last long. i don't hold this part against the design; part of the attraction was that it looked like a real truck and i don't think there's an easy way to add small details without some fragility. while this is orignally was one of my sons favorite toys he can't really play with it the way he'd like to. while he still enjoys driving it around the house he can't pick up the trash and dump it without an adults help and that's a shame. for the price i expected so much more.

" my daughter 6 received this for christmas. her 4-year-old brother also wanted to play with it. the first problem is that there are no instructions included for how to put it together. this is a problem when you have two antsy kids eager to play with it. i was struggling with getting the various panels to snap together solidly when after repeated attempts i happened to look in the drawer underneath the colored bulbs and crayons and found -- what do you know! -- screws. then after i put on the top i realized i should have installed the light bulb first (you need a light bulb of 25 watts or less not included). then when i thought i was done i found i had a piece left over. arrgh! that extra piece was a clip that is supposed to hold a picture for tracing. ha! even after i installed it there's no tension on the clip and very little chance that it will hold anything. there are two drawers to hold the bulbs and crayons. good idea. but for some reason the drawers catch and stick. how hard can it be to make drawers that slide easily in and out?

" i am a breast cancer survivor and i find this pink dressed blond doll of perfection rather insulting to my female self the perfect perky boobs the long blond hair the body that does not exist on a woman after the ravages of chemotheraphy. i can perfectly understand mattel wanting to support breast cancer research and donate a portion of proceedes towards funding (and thank you for your generosity) but to do it under the guise of selling a doll which does not reflect the community of women who have experienced the challenges of recovery and survivorship...a doll which does not look like a survivor is literally painful and insulting! why doesn't this doll have a wig? why doesn't she have a breast removed? why doesn't she have a bra fitted with a form to mimic the shape of a breast? what is wrong with reality? why can't mattel acknowledge the true nature of this disease and make a doll which comforts not insults the sensibility of women who have suffered from this disease. i will purchase this doll just because i am horrified by the product itself. i will disrobe her and with a saw cut off her breast so that she will look more like me a survivor a woman of pride. i will dismantle the construct of supposed beauty and make this image more like my own - because i am what is woman not the facade of a false construction.

" i purchased this toy based on the excellent reviews it had here at amazon it looked also like a fun toy with educational value. i am very disappointed. for starters my son finds it very frustrating that the front pieces for eyes face & hat can only go on in one order. he also has trouble pulling the pieces apart once they are together and he is very dextrous for his age. also disappointing is the lack of container to store all the pieces in. without this the blocks are loose in my son's toybox and we can never find all the pieces. the packaging could easily be redesigned to hold the pieces. all in all it is not a toy he can sit and play with without assistance as i had thought it might be. when he does play with it he enjoys it for about 15 minutes and moves on to something else. we could have done without this toy under our christmas tree ",negative

" after returning three defective tonka hands on power shovels (aka crane) we decided to try a different piece of machinery and brought home the dump truck. so far the dump truck is doing fine. it is not as exciting as the crane or digger but it does work and seems to be holding up. my son loves to turn it on &amp; have it &quot;follow&quot; him around the room. however the motor strains and the truck moves very slowly so i'm concerned that the load is too much for the motor. he likes the loading action of the front end shovel into the dump bed and the dumping bed. he was disappointed that it doesn't steer like the crane did but only goes either forward or reverse. but a working toy is better than an non-working toy and i'm hopeful this one will be a keeper ",negative

" 3 stars overall only b/c we love c3! read on... the batcave c3 set has some rather intense structural integrity problems that cause it to be next to impossible to put together without a supplemental fix-it set that was distributed by the mfg. after many seasoned adults protested their frustrations with its construction. since the company has now withdrawn all c3 items from its website it is not known whether the fix-it package is still available (it included thicker stronger support pieces for the first floor and additional pieces for a stairway support column). without these the set tends to implode well before you ever get the 2nd level completed let alone the 3rd! after all the problems started surfacing the company also increased the recommended age range to 7+ from the previous 4+. if you purchase a box that states 7+ as the age range it should include the fix parts (no guarantee we're only assuming) but even with the fix pieces it is still a major headache to put together and your true calling is an architect if you manage to get it safely together on the first try. it takes most adults several tries over several days (due to frustration stress level) to get this piece fully assembled. there is a step-by-step construction guide showing the problems (with crash pictures) in set construction amazon rules say i can't post the link here but it shouldn't be too hard to find if you enter c3 batcave in a search engine the full write-up is in a c3 forum. i know many people may still purchase--it is after all batman but i would at least try to see if you can acquire the replacement parts before ordering as you will have much greater chance for success. or wait until you get the package if it says 7+ on the box you just may be in luck. in the alternative maybe you could use super-glue to the existing inadequate structural supports? or raid your kid's lego stash and use thicker more stable blocks than the ones supplied with this set ",negative

" i bought this carry case for my son's l-max. it works well for carrying the unit and all the games he has for it. i wouldn't advise dropping it on a hard surface of any sort. it is not nearly padded enough to be carrying a hand held gaming unit of any sort. my son likes to take his l-max to school with him for mornings before school begins. i place it in the carrying case and then place the carrying case inside of his backpack to give it some extra cushioning. if i had known how little padding there was in this particular carrying case i probably wouldn't have bought it. there is a carrying case out for the nintendo wii that is similar in style but much more padded. i almost purchased it but then thought that i should get something designed for the leapster l-max. if i had it to do over i would have purchased the case for the wii. it might have been a little big but the extra padding would have made up for it. overall it is not a bad purchase but for the money you should get something a little more protective. after all the leapster starts at $69.99 and the price goes up accordingly for the l-max ",negative

(want more? fork out more $$$ for more booster packs.) and finally it takes so long to load from the cd (and it has to load every level) that it must be a 1x drive. seriously slow. although my son still loves the idea of it and has not admitted he's disappointed he does comment on how slow it is and how he wishes he had other kids to trade the cards with so he could get more. apparently we were the only suckers to buy it around here. it hasn't been played but maybe 4 times in the one month since christmas. if you notice it to be on a huge discount it may be worth it. but remember you have to pay extra for more cards. personally i wish we'd bought a used gamecube with a few cartridges. that has way more staying power than the hyperscan will ",negative

" i just recently purchased the red variant of this figure and was excited and pleased to have both a nice looking action figure as well as the piece of apocalypse. but as i was setting him up trying to move his leg it just snapped off at the hip joint. hence the 2 star durability rating. i have never had this problem with the legends line before and was very disappointed especially since it was the variant figure. some superglue fixed the problem but at the cost of some articulation. he is on my shelf now and looks great but if you're giving the toy to younger children be cautious. like i said i have never had any problems like this with a marvel legends figure before so hopefully it was just a fluke. the figure is still well worth getting and in fact i am going to pick up the green version sometime in the near future ",negative
" while the kids love it it's a headache for parents. it takes forever to inflate even with an air compressor thanks to many individual air chambers. as other reviewers noted it's best not to leave it outside (the manufacturer recommends against it due to potential sun damage) but it's far too big to leave up inside the house. not worth the time involved to set it up and take it down. i gave ours away ",negative
" our daughter has had this product for quite some time and sad to say she hasnt touched it much at all. this product does get alot of attention but it is more so with reassembly. it does not swing it does not stay together. i am constantly putting the legs back on and setting it back up and placing it with my daughters lil corner of little mommy playthings. of all the items collected this one seems to be the one with the most problems. we do have a variety of brands varying in price from cheaper to more expensive. this one is by far the worst product we have yet purchased for her collection. we have very few dolls that actually fit in the swing and the ones that do are too small for it. it is also the smallest item my daughter has for her dolls that range in size. we will not purchase another of these as well as recommend others to not purchase one. if the price is too good to be true then you will only get what you paid for ",negative
" this thing is a waste of time effort and money. it falls apart the minute the child tries to swing the baby not to mention it is too small for a two tear old to play with ",negative
" dissapointed with this product! our daughter can not even play with it without it falling apart! small pieces that disconnect from swing not a good idea for childrens toys ",negative

" first the volvo wagon is supposed to be scaled for the midge series of barbie dolls slightly smaller than regular barbie. another annoyance it comes with a little pink roll-on suitcase full of microscopic fisher-price replica toys that have nothing to do with the volvo. i put all the tiny pieces together in the suitcase for my granddaughter and the suitcase wouldn't close. i looked on the box illustrations and sure enough they show a suitcase not closed. how could they design such a silly bunch of add-ons? i just got rid of all that teeny-tiny stuff that doesn't relate to the inherent play value of the car. any kid would prefer to put her/his own stuff into a little suitcase than this mishmash of silly product promo from fisher-price. would have been nice to have a choice of colors even approximately the real colors that the volvo wagon comes in. i just wanted my granddaughter to be able to play-like with grandma's white volvo wagon. how hard should that be? overall i'm disappointed with this toy. for 28$ shipping included i expected a better toy. not worth the money ",negative
" when i bought this toy i thought it was soooo cool. but it really doesn't do anything it's supposed to do! it just makes annoying crying and whining noises that do not sound real. even if i tickle its tummy it just whines and cries. do not i repeat do not buy this toy!!!! ",negative
" the idea behind this toy is great & ours has lived up to its durability claim. my husband did not complain about adding songs to it so it could not have been too bad. batteries: this eats through them like crazy - and we used duracell. volume: the idea of volume control is good but the highest volume is way too low. i can't even hear anything until i get it to the mid-setting. my 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones. we probably should not have bought this until next year maybe fisher price will have improved it by then ",negative
" first of all i think the concept is great however the safety bobber doesn't open and after about a dozen casts the reel fell apart. if you're looking for something that shoots buy a rocket rocket not this rocket fishing rod and save some money. shame on you roland martin for sponsoring such a piece of garbage. don't expect to catch fish with this it is simply a novelty item ",negative
" my son was so excited for this toy. it was all he asked for on his 8th birthday. we went out to the lake this week and then began our frustration. first there is no way to launch this 30 feet unless the wind gusts and the moon and planets are alligned. then the safety bobber is so safe it doesn't even open when it hits the water but does cause such a large ripple in the lake that all fish are gone for hours. my son set it down after a hour of frustration and had me trek to the car to grab is old trusty fishing rod that is not as colorful and plastic but does actually cast and catch fish. don't get me wrong i think the rod is a gret idea but the people who designed it did a very slipshoddy job and i would warn anyone about spending money on it.

" like many my age i grew up with legos. my wife bought this kit for me for christmas. i was excited. after a couple of days of work my excitement had turned to frustration and finally to anger. this kit is poorly designed and the instructions are not well thought out. first the death star is built on a base that you construct of legos. this base is not very sturdy. the instructions said to put a bunch of parts just on one side. left alone the structure would tip over because of the imbalance. much of the structure had such flimsy connections that the slightest thing would break connections. i don't mean the quality of the legos; those things are impossible to break. i mean the way in which various bars hinges etc were put together. in the end my wife and i probably spent 40 hours building something that would not hold together. i love legos but this kit gets nothing but ill will for me. for lack of a better phrase this kit sucks ",negative
" do not waste your money on this toy the battery is not available for this toy. learn from my mistake. don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!! no where in the product discription does it tell you that the 9.6 volt battery is not included all it says is that you will have to purchase a 9 volt battery for the remote. don't look for the tyco 9.6 volt battery in a store or on line because it will be out of stock. i have been trying to purchase one for 4 months ",negative
" bad enough that the toy is a scam that requires extra parts. but the surprise here is the complicity of amazon in this misleading packaging. this is probably why the product is unavailable suddenly and the battery charger nowhere to be found. they know they made a mistake. if only they would contact us each now for a full refund. i wish a rep from amazon could have spent the holiday week with my family as we searched from store to store for that charger. i wish he could have spent an afternoon of watching my child stare at the toy he waited for. ..his big gift ",negative

" don't buy this price increased version. i doesn't work any better than the $19.95 model. plus it uses twice the amount of batteries. the concept is great the graphics are great and that's the end of it. this just like the first plug and play ms pacman (which i also bought) and has a joy stick issue. if the manufacturer would take off the games that need the twisting action of the joy stick maybe this would actually be fun to play instead of frustrating. while playing ms pacman which is the only reason i bought these plug and plays ms pacman has a mind of her own turns corners on her own and runs into the ghosts on her own. it's impossible to use the joy stick without twisting it during play and then you're out of control. it's extremely frustrating. for as popular as pacman and ms pacman were in their day and still are these plug and plays would sell on that merit alone so take off the games needing the turning action of the joystick ",negative

" pros: very cool toy/model for a 12+ with extra time on their hands. cons: too many microscopic pieces to count. very little room for open play. requires extreme caution playing with it because the propeller and other pieces fall apart at the slightest breath. not appropriate for under 7 at least. first just let me say that my son loves the lego duplo blocks and spends hours creating all kinds of different designs with them. he has been begging for the big boy legos and i have been turning him down pointing out the recommended ages on the box (knowing that i would be picking up infinite numbers of tiny pieces throughout the house for the next 18+ years). the ages they put on the box seem to be purely arbitrary based on this particular toy. a well-meaning relative decided to bless him with this present on his 5th birthday. (i will be seeking revenge as soon as they have children.) i spent the next several hours constructing this nightmare which in and of itself defeats the purpose of a building toy in my opinion. i have no idea where they have the idea that this is appropriate for a 5-year-old given that it was a challenge for me to put this together. given the amount of microscopic pieces in this toy one has to wonder who designs these things and if they have children of their own. so much of it seems purely sadistic. when the helicopter was finally assembled (and i warned him that that was the one and only time i was putting it together) my son spent some time playing with it only to be constantly frustrated by the fact that pieces were constantly popping off particularly the propeller and this was with very gentle play. bottom line if you have a child under 10 they would probably have many more hours of play if you just bought a lot of inexpensively priced lego blocks (of various types) that they could make into all kinds of different designs. these expensively priced city lines and the like are really neat once built but then it's just like a very fragile model. once you've spent the time constructing it you really don't want to take it apart so i'm not really sure why you would buy this over a traditional model. i guess i miss the point. ",negative
" i helped my five-year old assemble this and like most lego directions it went together well...unfortunately it doesn't stay together...when he tries to play with it the tail section falls off or it breaks in the middle...not as easy to put back together once it's come apart...it's proven a real disappointment..

" this marble maze looks so fun and cute. however it's actually useless and incredibly frustrating. the pieces don't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them--much less when you try to roll a marble through them. also the configurations pictured on the box don't work at all. either our giraffe is missing a critical piece or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate. ugh i'm returning this immediately ",negative

" i bought this kitchen for my 18 mos. old and she really enjoys cooking and working in it. it is a nice compact size that doesn't take up too much space. she can work at all the different stations and not get frustrated. another bonus for me was that it came fully assembled and ready to use straight out of the box. my only complaint would be that the doors are somewhat difficult for my daugter to open but i know as she gets older it will become easier. i would definitely recommend this kitchen to anyone who in interested in purchasing one for their child ",positive

" my kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with renaissance paintings. they've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them. i realize this is not the typical situation. i was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck. it is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid's knowledge. i had hoped for a game like famous authors which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players. nonetheless the game is well presented. it's on the expensive side but the book alone is worth half the price. looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones? i recommend this ",positive
" i received this game as a gift and it really is a great! the book that comes with it would have been a perfect 'cliff notes' for the art history classes i had in school. my eight-year-old daughter won the first game we played and i'm re-learning lots of stuff i had forgotten. highly recommended ",positive

" we have enthusiastically played candy land with each of our three kids. it is easily the best starting point for introducing a child to board games. players take turns drawing from a deck and moving their pieces around the board. the cards have one or two squares of a particular color (such as red green yellow etc.) and players move pieces ahead on the path to the next matching spot of the same color. no counting or reading is required. there are also special cards that can move a player ahead or behind and they are indicated by picture of the spot on the board to which the player should move their piece. play continues until one player reaches the end. some of my observations: 1) most kids can probably start playing and enjoying this game before the recommended 36 months of age. if you have a child with the attention span and the desire to sit down for a 10-15 minute game i'm pretty confident they could enjoy it. 2) among the lessons our kids learned from candyland: taking turns recognizing colors and dealing with disappointment. luckily the games are quick enough that it is usually possible to play multiple games in one seting. this makes it possible to keep playing until each child has had at least one win. (very helpful for managing little egos) 3) for such a simple game it manages to perfectly balance the possibility of changes in fortune without seeming arbitrary. the game is literally in doubt until the last card is played (one of the special cards might send a player back to near the start). this is great for teaching that most valuable of lessons: never give up. 4) with most simple games it is almost impossible to get older kids to play after they reach a certin age. we have not found that to be as true with candy land. we've had games with an adult and kids ages 3 6 and 9 playing together and having fun. if you have more than one kid you know how hard this can be. as a parent of three i give this game my highest recommendation ",positive

" this game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations. the luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice. strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have. sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn. all in all this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it ",positive
" i always thought clue looked like a complicated game i'd never touch! that is until i played it at my friends house! now i'm a clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions! this game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time! i strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older ",positive
" this is an extremely fun and addictive game. you shuffle the cards and place three (room weapon person) in the secret envelope. in every room you go into you can make accusations. if someone has the card you accused (like the room) then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad. the game changes constantly so it never gets boring. the character pieces have teeny details like mr. green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. i gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really think. oh and good problem-solving skills too. and coordination (you have to add all the clues up to see who did it). all in all a terrific game. great for rainy days or playdates. and did i mention the weapons? very realistic. and cute ",positive
" this little motorcycle is cute. however it's very lightweight and is similar in quality to a ride-on toy that could be purchased for much less at any discount retailer. the stickers do seem to be of high quality and to date none have peeled off. the extreme shipping price added another $10 to the $19.99 price tag. this is definately not a $30 toy.

" i-dog is so fun to use! all you have to do is plug the included cable into your digital player's headphone port and i-dog will play your music through a tiny internal speaker. i-dog's face will light up with various patterns and colored lights depending on what type of music you play. his tail serves as a mute button but be careful because he doesn't like you touching too often! i-dog will get sad if you don't give him any music to listen to. if you don't have a digital player you can set i-dog by your boombox or other music device and he can hear that way. there are only two reasons why i didn't give i-dog 5 stars: (1) the internal speaker isn't very loud so you have to have your music player turned up quite high and (2) the battery cover on i-dog's back leg is really hard to get off. you will definitely need some kind of tiny screwdriver to get it off ",positive

" just wanted to let others know this info that i found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer about getting the table for a lot cheaper at costco ... i called costco and they carried the kidkraft art table with two stools back in january of 2006 and will no longer be carrying it. you can find it at walmart for $66 plus shipping just check the website. the table is not the same however -- the dimensions are different the sides of the tables is slightly different (on one side of the kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in between the two cups and the other side has a space where little legos can snap onto). the stools are also tiny compared to the ones that come with this table. overall it looks a little less substantial but since i haven't seen it in person i really can't give my opinion. hope that helps someone ",positive

" i bought this set for my son who loves to draw and paint. he absolutely loved this set. the colors are wonderful and the different types of pens paints and crayons make drawing alot more fun for him. the case is sturdy and great so he doesn't lose anything. the price can't be better for everything you get.

" i am so glad i bought this puzzle for my 3 year old! the pieces have the most beautiful pictures on them and the larger sized pieces are just right for toddler hands. this is one of those toys that you'll want to keep forever ",positive
" it is really expensive for what it is. i have to say my children love it esspecially since we can put it in the middle of the table and everyone can take what they need from it. i love that when we are done you can put everything back and stick it on a shelf. however for the supplies you get it is expensive. the tote itself is nice but not worth more than $5 add the supplies to it maybe i could see spending $10. however if you catch it on sale i would pick up a few they make great gifts ",positive
" i bought this for my 3 year old daughter. she loved it in the store and i thought it was cute. i also agree with the other reviewers that there should be instructions for the stickers but you don't need to be a genious to figure out where they go. i chose to not sharoen the pencil because she is 3 and i didn't think it was necessary. for twenty dollars it is a good buy. i know my daughter loves it and is having a lot of fun with it ",positive
" very interesting spoof of the original game. i found the first one boring after a few plays but this one still interests my kids and i after 10+ plays. it's a bit convoluted to put it together initially but well worth it ",positive
" i always thought clue looked like a complicated game i'd never touch! that is until i played it at my friends house! now i'm a clue fanatic trying to collect all the versions! this game can never get old because it's a different outcome every time! i strongly reccomend it to anyone 8 and older ",positive
" every child should have a chance to play this game at least once in their lifetime. the characters on the game board are so awesome too. queen frosting (that was her name... right?) is so pretty she was always my favorite character. all in all it's a great game and a great gift for nearly any child ",positive
" we had so much fun with this game. there are truth or dares and all sorts of fun questions! i definatly recommend this game if you are having a party or even just a few people who want to have a good time! totally worth buying this one ",positive
" i agree with the other reviewer that this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen. my daughter loved it when she was 1. now she's turned 2 and she's lost interest in it like many other baby toys. i had to get her a larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can cook with it ",positive
" this was a great buy from amazons sale rack at five dollars and 29 cents plus free shipping. my [...] just loves puzzles and we are certainly fond of melissa and doug products. we normally purchase them from tuesday morning or our local hobby store because they are usually cheaper. this puzzle has made my toddler happy. he fits it together then dumps it repeating the process several times a day. the drawing is realistic and there are no pegs so it gives a little more grown up feel to the piece.

" my 9 year old son just started to understand this game we bought it when he was 7. he would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships. he would say where his ships were. this game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are. it depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game.

" i thought that this would be toy my daughter would grow into and not be excited about at first. this was the first toy she opened at christmas at only 19 months and was not interested in any others for the rest of the week! she enjoyed collecting the fingers and and counting them. she also has grown in the last few months to putting the puzzle together herself although the fingers might not make it on the correct hand just yet. very durable love that it is a traditional wood toy that doesn't have flashing lights or needs batteries! she still loves it months later. the only downside to any toy like this is we have to collect the pieces after she has put them in various places around the house.

" this board is of excellent quality and is highly transportable but a little small for go players who play avidly. the stones are also small but they get the job done. why i bought this board was because i wanted to be able to take it with me without a huge board dragging me down. this fits what i want almost perfectly. thanks ",positive
" when my 25 year old daughter sat down to play wedgits with her younger siblings she declared that she wanted a set for christmas. she thinks it will be a great coffee table game for all her college friends. my friend got a set for her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and son-in- law monopolize them with their little competitions. these are wonderful for the imagination and with wedgits you will have a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the children very happy ",positive

" this was the best therapy game ever. my girls bought it for me a gift because i love board games. we mostly played it with their friends. i have played with my children several times and found out some very interesting views that they have about me. i decided to bring it to a family gathering. i have always been distant with my eight siblings. the game started out with the kids and my sisters ect. then when they saw i was ok with laughing at myself they asked the children to leave and just the sisters played. we had a total awakening of how we see each other. we have never been closer since that game our communication has been wonderful. this game is the best. we laughed so hard we ached the next day. we played till 2:00 a.m. our husbands kept calling us asking when we were going be home. we started our game at 9:00 p.m. and told them we'd just be an hour or two. lol i have been instructed to bring the game to this summers get-together ",positive

" it seems that just about every house in our subdivision has an electric ride-on toy. there are few barbie jeeps few polaris atvs one corvette and three gators and few others. my 4 year old daughter was the first gator owner. i must say it is expensive.. this thing is by far the most expensive toy my daughter has bar none. should you buy your 4 year old $300 ride-on toy? well... that's up to you. but she loves her gator. she had to give up on lot of other toys to get this one but she is extremely happy with it. sometimes i wish i was 40lbs so i can ride this thing. she can't care less about the barbie thing so this green utility machine was fine with her. the gator is slightly faster than others and the fat tires and truck bed makes the gator looks a lot more serious than the barbie jeep. the truck bed is really useful. although not recommended she hauled two kids on the bed. with 4 kids on the car it still zoomed around the street quite well. one time i loaded nail gun air compressor electric drill and jigsaw and panel saw all on the bed and asked my daughter to drive to the other side of the yard to fix the fence. i saw our neighbor hauling few bags of mulch on theirs. it made such a funnt scene.. little electric toys carrying real tools and stuff. very cute. enough of fun stuff. problem 1. battery location and the hassle to recharge this thing. you have to open the front grill and sometimes the latch can pinch your finger. it hurts. problem 2. the left front wheel fell off while my daughter was driving it. i tightened it again and never happened. problem 3. slipping tires. people complain about the tires having very low friction. they slip very easily on driveway and grass. but this is how it protects its gearbox so i don't really care but i heard they are expensive once they wear out. i think this is the best ride-on toy on the market today. if extra $[...] won't hurt you too much then do consider the gator. your children will not be disappointed. ",positive
" we got this toy for my son when he was 2 1/2 years old he is now 4 years old. it still runs like new. he drives it like a champ. we have used it to haul mulch to the back yard and some yard bricks. it never fails us and he think he is a big helper which he is. i am thinking of buying a 2nd one for my younger son now.

" i ought this for my daughter for her 1st birthday. she loves the bead maze at the top and she goes round and round the cube exploring all the different sides! so as the title would suggest the stickers on the cog wheels are starting to come off (after 1 week). this doesnt affect the functionality of the toy just the aesthetics. if you are not bothered by some bare cogwheels this is still a great toy! it stands 2 feet tall to the top of the maze and is the perfect height for little ones. the other 3 sides are: abc with pictures rotating blocks abacus sliding plastic pegs. the only side with stickers is the cog wheels so no worries about other sides losing stickers. if they had made the cog wheels out of wood or had the design painted or imprinted into the plastic this toy would be a 10 ",positive

" this toy was bought for my son (14 months) because he has an obsession with the phone. my son instantly loved this toy and has been a great subsitute when he is reaching for the phone and i'm on it. it is a great travel toy as well. being in the armed forces we are constantly on the move and he loves sitting in his car seat on the rides and playing with his phone. sure this toy gets a bit old after a bit but it's a small price to pay for your kids true happiness. my one gripe with this phone is that within two days of him playing with it he broke the center button that flips the features. we returned it to the store and have not been able to find it except online. i'm sure it was just a fluke flaw and am buying it again ",positive
" this is an awesome game. the fun thing about it is building it. its better than the rollercoasters because you dont just watch it going in circles. it actually does stunts. its also not so easy to. its very!!!!!!!!!!!!! durable. just keep it away from babies. you have to order it off the internet so dont go looking for it at stores. overall its an excellent toy ",positive
" i purchased the mat to use with it and it works great ",positive
" my son got this for his 5th birthday and he loves it! he likes to turn off the lights and give shows for the family. we have not listened to the cds yet but i am sure they are a great add-on. my son is fascinated by space adn this porjector was a cool way for him to learn even more. i don't know if they revamped the design or someting but we love it and have no complaints. in fact we are going to purchase some of the other packs available ",positive
" this game set it of amazing quality. every piece has so much detail it just looks good without doing anything! the dubloons are the best part and like others have said make the best clinking sound when you drop a pile into your hand. this game is definately worth buying.... if you come up with some new rules that make the game more interesting. the gameplay is very uninteresting boring and brainless. my wife never passes up an opportunity to tell me how boring it was and even her younger (12 year old) sister thought it was boring and had more fun playing with the pieces. my wife says i should have bought us settlers of catan instead of spending my money on this (before we got our own set... now we have one) but when i bought it i knew it would be just for the game pieces. i am brewing up some good rules to change the gameplay dramatically and make it much more interesting. she likes settlers so much.. maybe i will get some trade of spices into the game and whatnot. anyways if you are creative and have a good idea for a ship game then definately get this game set. it is high quality and beautiful. but if you don't have the interest to make your own game then pass this one up because you would most likely love to play any other game you own before this ",positive

" the story of hansel and gretel is more than a warning against children talking to strangers (or trying to eat their houses). the recurring image of the forest in german fairy tales is a supernatural world where interesting things happen while the fact the father of hansel and gretel is a woodcutter is significant because this was one of the lowliest occupations at that time. therefore what we have here is the triumph of the poor working class characters over the witch and her upper class pretentions (she stores not only treasure but food) which would make her death some sort of proto-marxist warning if you are ideologically inclined in that direction. in the original manuscript of the story of the siblings were referred to as little brother and little sister. the brothers grimm chose hansel because it was a common name in german fairy tales (their equivalent of john doe so to speak) and picked gretel for essentially the same reason (which makes her jane doe). gretel (or gretchen) is a form of the name margaret which in latin (margarita) means pearl. all that background makes it rather ironic that for its twisted fairy tale series mcfarlane toys has turned gretel into a german princess striking a pose that suggests getting lost in the woods is the least of her worries. this six-inch figure has tattoos a spiked collar around her neck and torn fish net stockings. there are more details for you to discover when you look over the figure carefully and while she is not exactly a princess of bondage gretel appears to be familiar with the neighborhood. she also has a mop and a pail and there is ample reason to think she knows how to use them (the mind reels at the possibilities for rewriting the grimms tale). twisted fairy tales is the fourth series of mcfarlane's monsters and the rest of the menagerie consists of not only gretel's tag team partner hansel but red riding hood peter peter pumpkin eater and little miss muffet. if you were aware about the probable origins of a lot of the classic fairy tales then you already knew that mother goose had a twisted sense of humor. with these figures mcfarlane toys certainly takes being twisted to the next level. even if you do not want the entire set there should be one of these figures that captures the jungian dark side of the tales that we were all raised on once upon a time that most appeals to you ",positive
" the wagon is great as expected. 5 stars for the wagon no stars for delivery. it arrived with a dent though and when we called they told us a replacement wouldn't be available until mid-february plus we'd have to figure out how to re-pack the thing which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent . . . so we gently banged it out and spray-painted the spot and the recipients probably won't care but it was a pain-in-the-butt and there didn't seem any way to deal with it that wouldn't have been too much trouble. ",positive
" i got a wagon like this when i was really small. now i am 14 and istill use it for getting grocries from the store. it is still in good condition except it is rusty because i used to fill it with water nd make my friends ride in it. it is fun to ride down the hill from the store too my home. it can go really fast and it's easy to steer. you have to be careful if you cross the road and go onto a curb with kids in it. one time my mom was pulling me and my sister to the store. when she went over the curb it tipped over and my sister scraped underneath her nose. it is a great toy and even though i'm too old for it i still like it a lot ",positive
" i had a radio flyer wagon just like this as a child and loved it which is why i wanted one for my daughter. we bought ours when our daughter was a year old and she loved being pulled around the neighborhood in it. now that she's four she loves pulling her one-year-old little brother around or posing for pictures with him in it. we use it for picnicing in the local park or setting up an impromptu lemonade stand on the front lawn. the wagon seems to keep popping up in our family photos from the labor day block party to halloween trick-or-treating. it's a &quot;classic&quot; for good reason--kids love it and never stop loving it ",positive
" my son received this as a christmas gift and thoroughly enjoys it. this is not a regular dvd. it is designed to go with the read with me dvd system (a separate remote control that works with it on your tv). a previous reviewer was not aware of this so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error ",positive

" i bought this for my son's second christmas; he was almost 2. it was a recommendation of one of my parenting magazines and i had to hunt it down 3 years ago. he loved pounding the balls and he even could match the color of the ball to the color of the hole! he still plays with it and i will be buying his baby brother one when he's big enough ",positive

" i have wanted to buy a musini for my son for a few years now but never found one in a retail store online or local. i recently gave in and bought one gently used on ebay for a fantastic price including the cartridge. my entire family loves it including my 2-year-old son. it was very easy to figure out how to use even without a manual. on the battery case are very clear easy to follow instructions on how to calibrate the sensitivity of your musini. within minutes we had found the perfect setting for our carpeted living room and we were all dancing. even my parents who came to visit one night were bopping to the musini! my dad couldn't keep his feet still insisting on drumming them on the floor constantly to keep the music going when my toddler had taken a seat to rest for a minute. i have found myself taking it out during my son's nap time to put near me while i do the mundane chores around the house. it is really addicting and keeps us all moving! i can't say enough good things about this toy. the music quality is absolutely wonderful and is clear and crisp and a joy to listen to. you also tend to feel like you are actually playing an instrument when you're dancing around or even sitting on the floor tapping your fingers. the songs are mostly familiar and well-loved songs that you will instantly recognize. i have also noticed that you can use the musini to up your child's physical activity. if you change the sensitivity so that they must jump or stomp hard you suddenly have an even greater outlet for energy and a great source of exercise! you can of course adjust the sensitivity so that a single finger tap across the room will register. it's up to you and i think it's fantastic! highly recommended ",positive

" we had a simpler and earlier quercetti marble run. this was an upgrade/add-on and well worth it. the motorized elevator keeps the action going. a five year old will need help setting up but can operate the final run easily. safe pieces easy construction and good directions. fun even for the adults ",positive
" gave this to my 6 year old for his birthday. i helped him to construct it from the clear (no reading) directions along with my 10-year old daughter. the pieces go together flawlessly - the engineering of the plastic is superb. the elevator works as designed and the battery pack (2xaa) connects via a short cord - very convenient. he has already spent many hours playing with it ",positive
" our three children who are now in their forties were young when we purchased a bozo bop bag for them. they loved it used it all the time and it held up beautifully through the years. now our daughter has a daughter of her own and we purchased one for her. same design same wonderful quality same use as forty years ago. bozo is a friend who likes to be punched so he can bounce back up. our 3 year old grand daughter loves him. she now has a baby sister 7 months old who will also be able to make use of bozo. for toddler activity and appropriate acting out i thoroughly recommend this product with no reservation. it's a bit pricey but worth 5 stars for sure ",positive
" i looked for years to get the bozo punching bag as it was a part of my youth. finally i located it and purchased it for my grandson 7. he loves it as does all of his family who use it to take out their frustrations. lol built very sturdy as he drags it around the backyard as well ",positive

" this figure of the great wayne gretzky is a must-have for those who collect hockey memorabilia. the figurine is life-like with gretzky's expression looking just as it did whenever he scored a goal. what i love most about this toy is that you can purchase gretzkys that wore different jerseys to represent the eras in hockey his playing career spanned. if you are like me and collect gretzky memorabilia (pictures cards jerseys etc) this is an artifact that will fit quite nicely in your collection.

" since i had always wanted a mad scientist lab when i was a girl and never got one my husband purchased this for my 4 1/2 yr old son and i to do together. overall it's been fun. everything but water has been included which is a plus. the lab comes with interlocking pieces which can be assembled in a variety of ways. i like this component because it helps children with problem solving creativity and motor skills. the kit also comes with recipie cards and its own measuring spoon and beaker. it's really taught my son to learn how to measure. however the recipie cards tend to generalize and direct you to refer to other recipie cards which my son would not be able to figure out without my help. the steps on the cards come with both words and pictures which was a plus but they omitted some details that probably only a grown up would catch. on the other hand the experiments or recipies go from simple gelatin molds of bugs to more complicated creatures that progressively build upon previous experiments. they also encourage creativity by giving further suggestions for mixing colors flavors. i was also pleasantly surprised at how well the experiments actually tasted for a toy kit. on the other hand if made as directed we found it difficult to actually fill the monster molds with the amounts directed on the recipie cards. overall this was a great gift because it got my son and i to spend some fun time together ",positive
" i found this hamper storage bin to be great the kids can see into the bins and the bins don't add weight to the unit so the kids can carry the bins easily to pick up toys. however the bins could be a little bigger because they tend to fall off the holding rods if you bump the unit. the hamper is great because my 3 year old son can fill up his hamper but he can't tip it over and spill dirty clothes on the floor but it is light weight and easy for him to help haul to the laundry if he wants to. good ite ",positive
" i looked everywhere for a plastic durable toybox seems so simple but unfortunately no one kept anything in stock to look at in person. i took a chance on this one because the price was right and i'm very pleased. i like the pockets on the front my son loves putting his books in & out. if i would change one thing it is the lid. it is lightweight as to not hurt little hands & fingers (which is good) but is never locked onto the toybox it lifts off very easily so sometimes just bumping it causes it to fall out of the shallow indentations it sits in. other than that we love it ",positive
" we got this toybox for our daughter when she turned one. we love that it doesn't have any sharp corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside. it still looks like new 6 month later so it is very durable. if your child likes to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them breaking it since the bottom is fabric. we also really like the pockets in front for storing smaller items- we always stick her favorite dolls and animals in there. we don't use the cover so that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us. highly recommend!

" i have been wanted a non-electronic non-paper sudoku game for some time. rubik's sudoku is a self contained single player game board. i can move it from room to room without the playing pieces moving from where i have placed them on the board. there is one extra piece for each number/color tile included. with the color coding it is easy to learn the strategy behind sudoku. i was not picking it up very fast when i tried the paper versions. after i progress through the 100 puzzles included with this game i'll use the game board and pieces with the sudoku magazine i have. for the cost i would recommend this over the more expensive wood versions. if cost is not an issue then you might go for one of the more durable all wood versions that amazon has ",positive

" my daughter has been riding for about 3 years now and she was so excited to see this christmas morning. of course that was one of the first things she wanted to play. her grandma and i played and i was surprised at the amount of things i have learned just from taking her to her lessons! i'm sure there is a way to alter the game so there are more questions like trivial persuit but that was my only problem with the game. there isn't questions asked every move. but otherwise it is an excellent game. i would definately recommend it ",positive

" i bought my girls ages 7 and 4 this product earlier this spring. it was easy to assemble but finding the right height at which to hang it was a fairly time consuming process. it has been up for 4 months now and has seen daily use. when our play group meets here the kids line up to have a turn over and over again. i would recommend this for children who are reasonably coordinated and who have enough upper body strength to hold themselves up by their hands. a very durable product and a fun physical activity ",positive

" our 2-year-old loves thomas the train so this was a great gift for her. she has other thomas items but they're limited to playtime. this however is not only good for playtime but safe enough for her to take to bed with her (she even kicked her elmo out to make room for thomas!). it's also small enough for her to be able to take on car rides. a great all around item to have if you've got a child that's really into thomas ",positive
" i was a bit afraid after reading the reviews but this game is a hit with kids all ages. it takes about 3 minutes to set up but it's not hard and the bees don't fall thru. we played more times than i can count this past week and everyone enjoyed. i bought it for my 5 year old but her cousins (ages 19 17 and 13yo) joined in the fun and actually asked to play. my husband and i also got a kick out of it! even our 3yo loved it but she is incredibly lucky and would just pull randomly at leaves and none dropped she's good! our child didn't get bored while we were setting it back up but everyone was sticking leaves and talking so i guess it depends on your children's patience or attention span. in a few words: we all loved it ",positive

" i chose this railway set over learning curve because i believe their prices are inflated and i was not disappointed with it. the set is well made overall with smooth well-fitting track and sturdy accessories. my son (3) and daughter (6) have played with the set for hours every day since we got it both with equal fascination. it fits perfectly with thomas accessories we already own. i have only three small caveats: 1) buy some sure track clips to use on elevated portions of the track. we use it on a smooth level surface (hardwood floor) but the clips really enhance the stability for active play. 2) the round turntable did not spin freely when we got it because the blue center piece was not perfectly round. we drilled out the rivet and removed the blue center piece sanded down the edges and replaced it. now it's very easy for my kids to operate. 3) the trains included have slightly wobbly wheels compared to thomas trains. but they are functional and my kids use the trains interchangeably. it's a great set and a real bargain ",positive
" i originally bought this for my husband an emt/ff. i wrote a poor review of company based upon my entire experience w/ this storefront and the other items i had purchased. i wasn't terribly pleased with the [...] pen but my husband took it to work and loved it. said it went off several times from pocket while driving..and the entire er loved it. overall it is fun and writes and does what it's supposed to: make you laugh ",positive
" i appreciate the previous reviews but we had already gotten the game by the time i read them. my family - ages 4 6 10 and three adults playing really enjoyed this game. we played until we had a winner (not too long)and then everyone remaining wanted to play to get a second place winner. just our opinion - but we had a good time ",positive
" i bought this car for my 4 1/2 year old son who absolutely loves the movie cars. he also loves those hot wheels cars. i got him this car and he really liked it. in fact all of my kids (ages 4-15) like it! it's a really cute toy. it's even great if you are a cars collector ",positive
" my daughters (ages 5 and 2 1/2) were given these dolls for christmas. they love them and play with them every day especially the 5-year-old. i think the littlest one may be a little too young to really enjoy her fully but she plays with her when her big sister plays with hers. i'm glad i didn't let some of the reviews discourage me from getting these. all the problems people are having with the limited english can be very easily remedied if they read the directions fully. first of all you must switch the doll from display mode by moving the little switch on her back. the doll comes in the mode used so that people can try her out in the store. in this mode she will only say one or two things in english. one you move the switch you just have to wake her up and hold the button util she's speaking english. from that point on she should speak english even after waking up. however if you turn her completely off via the back switch you will have to switch her back to english by holding the bracelet down. i really have not had a problem and certainly don't have to spend time interpreting what she's saying. that's why they make directions - it tells about the display mode right on the front ",positive
" i bought this doll on ebay for my daughter for christmas because it wasnt available in stores. my daughter who just turned 6 yrs old loves this doll. doll speaks both english and spanish. the only thing i dont like is that this baby keeps going to sleep after meals but if your child wants to keep it awake you can press the bracelet or put the bottle in the mouth. its a good thing if you dont want to run out of batteries soon or to give the doll some rest ",positive
" this game is fun for the family. it's very simple and can be played by young children learning to count. it's not overly exciting by itself but you can make it that way with your own spin on sound effects ",positive
" this set is perfect for my daughter's new toy oven (miele) that she received for christmas. the pots and pans are sized just right and the utensils are fit perfectly with the pots and pans. one of my utensils already broke apart but that happens. i have a 3 year old girl who loves to cook but she is 3 and is not always careful. not sure whether that utensil wasn't made well enough or it's a 3 year old's play but the rest of the set seems fine. i would recommend this and the miele oven ",positive
" i was happy to order this early so they wouldn't run out but i later saw the same set at a local store. there was only one left on the shelf so i'm glad i ordered them anyway. they are my youngest son's favorite cars to start off with every morning ",positive
" we got this when my kids turned 3 however could have gotten it when they turned 2. we play it every day. it tells you which player's turn it is it also counts the number of spaces you are suppose to go with you and then it says you're on the 'yellow' space as a double check. there are 2 modes and we can play on the difficult mode (the difference being with the easier mode you only have to know colors with the more difficult mode you have to know the alphabet). the characters are really cute to. best of all everyone is a winner - yeah! a concept that is difficult to teach a 2 or 3 year old but this games does a superb job. the computer chip knows what space you are on so it makes sure that everyone wins within 2 turns (that i've experienced) so those with little patience can wait it out ",positive
" i bought the bean bag toss as a christmas gift for my 22 month old son. he had played the bean bag toss the first time at the halloween carnival at the church. it was all he wanted to play that night. i wanted something that would be easy to pick up at the end of the day. at just three piecesit is simple to put together and take apart. although it says it is for 5 and older it would probably get old fast for a child that age ",positive
" this is a great game that is made very well. it is nice and solid wood construction with great bright colors. it will last us many years. i bought it for a small carnival style fundraising event that we needed games for children to play. it will surely be a hit! my daughter (8 years old) tried it out and really enjoyed playing with it. it has three bean bags of different weights making the game differing in difficulty. i would recommend this game to any one looking for entertainment for children. this game is best played on a table so that a child can stand and throw the bean bags ",positive
" my three year old son is just discovering thomas and from reading other reviews and speaking with veteran mothers of thomas fans i realized how important collecting the different characters is in order to reenact the scenes from the videos. this set made a nice addition to his growing collection and the price was nice too. the wooden trains are a bit exspensive but are well worth it in the long run due to the fact that they will be played with for years to come unlike most other toys that children outgrow or become bored with almost as soon as they recieve them ",positive
" me and my bf loves this plug n play game wheel of fortune we bought it at target store. thumb up for this one and plenty of words. ",positive
" muffet vs spider! this is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as muffet makes it a kick butt scene. again the turn is to the s&m pink & black leather bondage look similar to the spiked outfit of red riding hood. this is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it's a great display piece. the downfall from five stars is that when setup muffet is almost obscured by the spider. both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures ",positive
" i hate spiders (yes i admitt that i make my wife kill them) and so does miss muffet...or is she. as her outfit might suggest looks like miss muffet as a bit of a fetish going on need i say s&m and with that said being pinned (blindly i might add) by this monsterous spider may be more of a turn on then you might think. you'd expect to see miss muffet in a frilly dress and bonnet maybe blue dress to be exact but with her lether bondage in black and pink this 'twisted' point of view proves to be anything but expected. i say kudos to you mcfarlane for truly reimagining the fairy tale (nursury rhyme whatever) and giving us yet another piece of art ",positive

" my son is a huge fan of the thomas & friends diecast trains and building sets. despite the fact he had amassed a large portion of these toys an important character was missing from his collection: terrence the tractor. of course he was thrilled when this little vehicle showed up in his easter basket. no terrence is not a train but one of the tractors that plows the fields on the island of sodor. terrence is a wonderful character with his bright orange coat of paint and happy face. he has one magnet on his back end perfect for pulling trains (or having trains pull him). in all honesty we have not had any problems with terrence's treads coming off--they are designed to wrap tightly around the wheels when rolling so no matter how hard my three-year-old tugs on them they stay put. terrence is also a very durable toy--my son has dropped him stepped on him ran him into the other trains and terrence shows no signs of wear tear split wood or chipped paint. finally terrence is small enough to fit easily in my son's hands during play but can also be slipped into a coat pocket during a car trip. all in all terrence is a terrific vehicle and a perfect addition to a child's thomas & friends collection ",positive
" this large version of michael myers is a lot beter than the mcfarlane version released ever how many years ago. first the pose is better.second no blood stains! don't get me wrong michael myers is a movie killer but he never got bloody! that was my biggest complaint with the mcfarlane version. he does have slight oily looking stains on his coveralls but if you remember from the movie he killed a mechanic to get those coveralls. finally third and pretty cool the sound effect is diffrent. instead of laurie strode's whiny help me you get the halloween theme playing along with michael's breathing. remeber the end of the first movie after loomis shot him but the body was missing the closing shots were shown with the theme music accompanied by myers' breathing. if you got the neca boxed set of michael myers and loomis and liked it get this! if you got the mcfarlane version get this! if you just like halloween get this! you won't be disappointed! looks better in person than on the picture ",positive
" the fun surprises with all of the magical castle playsets were a hit with my child. she had a great time using her magic wands to see what would happen. with the bathroom playset having the vanity doors pop open and a step stool (i assume so dora could step up to the sink & brush her teeth) pops out was a very fun surprise. my 7 year old has already spent many hours making up princess stories with the castle. the whole set was a great buy ",positive
" we have several boxes of these melissa and doug bead sets b/c we just can't get enough of them! my three children (twin boys - one girl) love to sit and make necklaces over and over again! yes! my boys love this too!!! it's a great exercise for their fine motor skills! the patience they have all developed to sit and string these small beads together is wonderful! it's great practice for them as they create different patterns with each new necklace. i suggest getting a few boxes - especially if you have more than one child playing with them at the same time. our favorite set includes letters so they can each spell out their own name or other words. **not suggested for small children who will mistake them for pieces of candy.

" we bought this toy for our 1 year old son. it is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great. i agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well. my biggest compaint however is that when both lids are closed the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder. our son constantly tries to climb it like stairs. the other day he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle. my son fell over with it and crashed on his face. there are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon but they do not prevent it from falling over. my son is fine but this toy is very dangerous and i do not recommend it!

" i purchased this from amazon having only seen it in photographs. based on the online images i expected the top to be opaque pink and the bottom part to be see-thru pink so i could see what was inside. when it arrived the top was indeed the exact color as on amazon but the bottom was a pearlized lighter opaque pink. i don't have any problem with this in fact i may even like it better but it was just unexpected. overall the case is great. just as advertised it will hold 15 dolls in a standing position with plenty of space in the 2 compartments in the lid for all sorts of shoes and accessories. the doors on top are difficult to open and i know i will have to help my 4 year old with it at first until they soften up a bit but at least they won't be flying open spewing mini plastic platform shoes everywhere. as one previous reviewer noted there is a larger open space in the main compartment that isn't great for holding a lot. i plan on using either a ziploc bag in that space to maximize it or attaching a (pink!?!) piece of cardboard or thin plastic to extend the height of it. we'll then be able to fit massive amounts of clothes in there! my cart does say barbie on the lid but the markings are discrete and tastefully done. overall i like this cart. it's probably the best storage device for barbie that i've seen. it's cute fairly well-made and will hold a ton. i didn't give it 5 stars because of the issue with the interior storage the handle seems a bit flimsy the wheels are not great for carpet and it's a bit pricey ",positive
" i give this leap pad book 3 stars for fun because my children were not interested enough to even look at all the pages.they played with it a lot but did not get even half way through maybe that just means it is full of fun stuff to do but since my kids have not gone back to it i feel it does not hold their interest quite enough. educational 4 stars because some of it seemed a bit simple like the space page. 5 stars for durability because it is no more and no less durable then regular leap pad books. dont like the eraseable pen though. must cover it each and every time even between questions. if it's off more then 5 seconds it dries out.i peronally did not find it very easy to keep picking up and putting down pens. i tried using a pen in each hand and it dried out so i had to keep putting down the regular pen to cover up the eraseable pen. pretty annoying ",positive

" easy straightforward interface (for instance a button for each number) and navigation through cells. easy to tell which numbers start with the puzzle and which ones you entered. provides time-penalized hints in any cell. pauseable and saves your game between (auto-off) power sessions. most importantly this device lets you make pencil marks! i have checked out at least a dozen products and i have yet to come across an electronic sudoku that electronically lets me enter dots or xs to indicate which numbers might (not) be in a cell. it makes me wonder if the people ordered to design and implement these games actually play sudoku themselves. the closest i've seen let you enter multiple numbers in a cell and it blinks through them which i find cumbersome and patience-trying. sadly this thing doesn't do electronic marks either but their lower-cost solution involves a dry-erase pen that lets you make the marks right on the screen on top of little numbers printed in each cell's background. losing marks in travel is prevented by the recessed contours of the screen. why not 5 stars? just the fact that the marks aren't electronic there's no backlight and the shadows cast by the dry-erase marks can be a little disorienting. otherwise a well-done fun and addictive product ",positive

" i've been an amazon customer for years but this is the first time a product stood out enough for me to write a review. i bought this for my 8 yr. old daughter and i figured my 6 yr. old son could use it later. i was very hesitant because there aren't a lot of reviews and it's expensive. well we've had it a few days and my daughter has been playing more with secrets of the master magician: an apprentice's manual which i also bought at the same time (another great gift). my daughter is interested in this and it's easy for her to put things together. my son is obsessed with it! it's similar (for him) to the lego creatures he puts together. he needs a little help from time to time but he can certainly follow the very well laid out diagrams. so far they've created an fm radio a scifi noise maker a sound detecting space noise maker thingy a propeller that spins and flies into the air a seven segment display a volt meter connected to the solar cell. after connecting the solar cell i realized my son thought the solar cell would come on like a computer screen or tv! after explaining it and putting my hand over it; now they both know what a solar cell does. - there are 5 books of experiments. - each project has a nice simple color picture of how to connect all the components. - all components are clearly marked. - the diagrams are a top view. since the connections are layered on top of one another 2 and 3 deep it takes a little figuring as to what's on top and what's on bottom. it's easy for an adult. it's part of the puzzle for the kids. after we put a few together they both got it. - the pieces seem sturdy enough and snap together easily - there is great assortment of parts to create lots and lots of very interesting projects. - my kids love the projects. i've been very impressed. - it has a cable that you can connect to the microphone port of a pc sound card. i haven't played with this. there is software it looks like you can turn your pc into an oscilloscope. looks interesting. there's a whole book for these projects. i just saw the cover so it's likely that there's even more to it. my kids are learning a lot with this. while they are putting things together i can explain how these different parts work. there are lots of opportunities to take the project and modify it by replacing parts change a light out for the speaker etc. for example my son put the 7 segment led together. i wasn't impressed. i was hoping to put together a counter but it just connects each segment to ground to turn all the segments on. there are 750 projects so maybe there is a counter project. regardless my son was fascinated. he changed all the connections manually to count from 0 to 9. he changed the main power resistor to see it go brighter with a smaller resistor and dimmer with a bigger resistor. lots of implicit learning going on. i pointed to the microwave display and said see that's how it works!

" if you're not sure if your little one will really be into these train sets this one is a great one to try out. it's more fun when you get all the extra buildings but if it's an iffy situation then i highly recommend this set. we bought this set for our little one because he just wasn't too sure about these trains. however after he received it he found out that he liked them and well now we have a bunch of them! the $40 is not much to invest n a toy that they're not going to play with either! i just wish this set had more things with it besides just the track and the train. however you can get a little better deal if you buy the track separately from maxim who makes brio trains now and the train separately as well. this train will chew up the batteries pretty quickly unless you use duracell. energizer only makes it two days in this train but duracell makes it two-and-a-half weeks. other than that highly recommend this toy ",positive

" i bought this because as a kid my grandparents had one that i would play with constantly everytime i visited and at the age of 7 was certain i could solve it. i never did and eventually it broke and it wasn't until i was sitting at my work waiting for my computer to do something that i thought i needed something to do while i waited for my computer to unfreeze or for the network to come back online. so i bought a rubiks cube figured that it was a good portable puzzle thats easy to store and is only one piece. it came with a display stand so i keep it displayed next to my monitor and have co-workers come by and scramble it hoping that i won't be able to put it back but i always have. like i said its a puzzle but not with alot of pieces and its portable so if your taking the bus home you can kill time with it then put it back in your briefcase or backpack. i love it and haven't gotten sick of it yet ",positive
" one day i realized that my baby is now a toddler and his toys are all...well baby toys! i browsed the toy aisles for the perfect age apporpriate replacements hating to spend more money on more plastic yet desperate for anything that will engage him for at least 15 minutes and keep him still so i can put clothes away vacuum sometimes just sit and play. this does it! reliable duplo/lego quality. non frustrating because the pieces actually stay together. easy assembly. of course my little guy is 22 months so i still have to do the majority of the assembly. i did get this for him at age 19 months and by now he has caught on as to how to put the track together. he tries to put the cars together but still needs my help to lock the pieces in place. i am constantly amazed at how much toddlers pick up by watching grownups so keep putting this back together while your little one is present. luca does love to disassemble the track and it is a challange keeping it together however over the last month persistence has paid off and he has figured out how to re-assenmble his little messes. the assembly is easy enough for him to get it on his own! these chunky toys accomomodate busy little toddler hands perfectly. this particular set comes with everything necessary for your toddler to get to work. this set has just enough to busy your toddler without being overwhelming! this set has satisfied my little guy (although i did buy him the toby (he is just so cute) set too. my older boys take tae kwan do every night and this set is a staple in the karate bag. it definately keeps the younger .0brothers and sisters busy and off the mats. other add-ons are available but right now this set and the toby have been just enough! the price sems high for the seemingly few pieces. i am the first to admit it is difficult to commit to a 25$ purchase but as with lego/duplo products the quality and play/learning value add greatly to the plastic parts making it an excellent purchase! great grandparent gift! even a perfect toy to keep at grandparents house!

" our daughter got the pull and spin caterpillar for christmas (she was 9months at the time). at the time she wasn't able to pull it but loved to chase the caterpillar as it was being pulled. now at 12 months she is able to pull it herself and loves putting just about anything on the back of the caterpillar. the toy it self has a very cute face and when pulled the eyes and ears move up and down. the only problem with the caterpillar is the pull string. it is very small and thin allowing it to slip through little hands while trying to pull it. overall a wonderful toy not only for the balls that come with it but for anything else that your little puts on it ",positive

" my 6 yr old loves this game of war. the food chain comes to life in this game of who eats who. besides the plankton shrimp little fish big fish and shark there are also electric eel cards and ink out octopus cards for added excitement. the game is played like war but the instructions add a slap jack element. this is not my favorite part. we have limited the slap jack part to just the electric eel card which still annoys me and makes it difficult for a younger child to play with older children. the ink out card prevents anyone from winning that set of cards and gives the person with less shark cards a chance to win shark cards from the other person. this game can go on and on don't be afraid to adjust some rules to make this game more enjoyable for your little one and not so complicated. the cards are made well.

" my children (4 & 6)love this game. it is great because no reading is necessary. the game asks the questions and even repeats them when necessary. while my kids don't know all the topics covered they enjoy the game. the fact that the game makes sure they move the correct number of spaces is great too. i definitely recommend this game and i will probably buy the next level of it.

" truly wonderful! my 4 year old son hasn't quit playing this game since christmas ",positive
" i bought this for my son for christmas after he saw it advertised in a magazine. he has been playing with it almost non-stop since then. it is loud and somewhat intricate but easily masterable by small kids. it also connects with other matchbox sets and comes with a mat for layout. based on my boy's interest and use so far this rates 5 out of 5 ",positive
" my three kids have loved this tunnel since they were two(they are now 57 & 9) they still play with it alot. they do a variety of things with it including magic tricks where the child inside will magically disappear. it's great exercise too to be on your hands and knees. they also love to play tornado with it where one child gets inside standing up while the others throw stuffed animals into it meanwhile the child inside throws them back outlike a real tornado does ",positive
" this is a great toy for kids of any age. we bought it last year when my daughter was 2 1/2. she still plays with it. it folds up very nicely and no matter how many times her and my 6 year old son jump on the outside it still looks like new. at my son's 6th birthday party (13 boys 2 girls) the kids stood with it upright and pretended they were an alien worm while the other kids beat them with blow up swords. yes i was supervising but the tunnel took the beating and is still in great shape. even out cats crawl through it. there are not many toys that are this much fun and durable ",positive
" what more can you say? it's durable it's fun it folds so nicely and be put away! good buy ",positive
" i was skeptical about this one.. as i have learned that the cheaper the toy is.. the less my baby likes it. though he absolutely adores this floor mat. i got it for him when he was 2 months old. he is only 4 months old now but can't get enough of it. the little octopus does make sound when it spins.. but he can't reach it yet. though its hilarious to watch him try! he gets so frustrated and beats up the other toys but then smiles in the end when i go spin it for him. i give this 5 stars because the floormat itself is. i would give it 4 stars but that is based on my baby and all babies are different. the only problems we have with it which would make it 4 stars would be the fact that aside from the octopus there are no other sounds and there are no lights. my baby loves sounds and lights. so if you have one of those expect yours not to want to play as long on the mat in the beginning stages. ours plays for about 20-30 minutes then he wants to be moved to his swing so he can look in the mirror and hear the music. but you can get really good tummy time on this and it keeps them entertained and laying out straight (instead of scrunched up in a swing so often) so you can get a few things done around the house. oh and we have noticed that our baby will play on it longer if we go over and play with him every once in awhile. helping him reach the toys making the octopus spin etc. then we get another 20 minutes to do whatever. so all in all... its a great product... just be warned that the little mirror on one of the fish.. isn't a mirror. its one of those flashy material looking things and the baby can't see his reflection in it.. cause i cant even see mine in it. if the toys are hanging to low for your baby you can flip them over the top bar once and they will hang higher or move the baby on the mat a bit. ",positive
" i work at a daycare and have an 11 mo old and can promise this is a great toy! my baby loves it and she usually gets bored with toys fast. all of the babies like to open and close the door and crawl through. it also has a doorbell that rings and a light that turns on. it plays several different songs and really keeps the attention of older children as well as babies. i highly recommend ",positive
" my children enjoy this playouse. in the summer i had it in the backyard. in the winter it lives in the basement. i bough acrylic paints to color the interior. this will be their surprise when i put it outside in the summer. it will look like a new playhouse. buy this and enjoy playing with your children ",positive
" we just set up our playhouse and i'm very happy with it! it's large enough for a parent to sit inside it was easy to set up and my 2.5 year old son is loving his new playhouse! he really likes the basketball hoop/game side of the unit. i wish there were more electronic noises and interactive components on the walls of the playhouse but i still think it's a great value for the money ",positive
" based on the other reviews this grandmother decided to buy this particular playhouse for my grandson's first birthday present! i am not the least bit disappointed. colorful action packed activities everywhere sturdy easy to assemble cold weather friendly and perfect for the little boys in your life! there are a lot of girlie playhouses but this one is the answer for boys. my son put it together in about an hour and was ready for the birthday party guests. happy grandmother ",positive
" this update of the old big wheel style green machine is made to handle the height weight and wear and tear of big boys (and girls up to the latter 30s have even been caught on it) yet the seat is easily adjusted so that the average 5-year-old can reach its pedals. the main cool feature is the dual lever steering. just like with the original hollow model plastic version pulling on the steering levers in opposite directions sends the machine into a wicked spin-out that kids just can't get enough of. yet under the usage of some pretty crazy 6 9 and 12 year olds on a steep downhill driveway the machine has almost always remained three wheels on the ground. so first i am amazed at the staying play value of this toy. for two years now it has been the first toy out of the garage every time the door opens. and second i am amazed at its durability. the 9 year old who uses it reguarly is an evel kneivel who is notorious for breaking my children's toys left and right and so far it has held up without a squeak. this was a million times better value for our hundred spot than the darn motorized motorcycle we bought a couple years prior for twice that amount which only lasted a year before the gears stripped. definitely consider this for your 5-10 year old boy even if he already has a two-wheeler. it's a whole different kind of fun. ***** all the way ",positive
" my 21 month old daughter received baby pooh for christmas and plays with him every day. she loves diapering pooh when her baby brother gets a diaper change and bathes with him nightly. he comes with a duckie and bottle of his own. the high chair back does not stay attached to the chair but pooh still sits upright and has enjoyed many meals with my daughter. pooh is made from hard plastic and sadly his arm broke off when dropped by my husband this weekend. my daugher is handling the trauma ok but we are getting her an new pooh for her birthday because she loves him so much. i recommend it ",positive
" this train table is a nice size bigger than i expected. it went together easily and is sturdy enough for my grandson's thomas stuff. it seems to be made as well as what i saw at toys r us for double the price. ",positive
" i bought this for our grandson age 13 soon to be 14 and he was very pleased with it. he did say that it was a little more difficult to put together but he did it and was very pleased with himself and with the results. thank you for making this possible. the price was right ",positive
" my son received the smartville ice cream shop for his first bday. he played with it all the time. we bought him the rest of the set for christmas. this is definitely his favorite toy. he is 15 months now and he plays with this set almost all day long. this is one of the best things i could have bought for him. he understands how it works by placing the characters on the round spots. i feel it will be a great teaching tool for when he is ready to learn the alphabet and his numbers ",positive

",positive
" i bought this high chair for my daughter's second birthday because i love the look of it. the similar chair made by badger basket toys gets terrible reviews for being poorly constructed so i went with this one despite it having no reviews. i couldn't be happier. this high chair is solidly built and was easy to assemble. i love the white finish because it will be relatively neutral as my daughter's room may go through decorative changes in the coming years. i don't forsee her outgrowing this toy for quite a few years and it is sturdy enough to last. she has several dolls the largest being her 17 corolle lila who fits beautifully in the chair. i would guess that this chair could possibly handle up to a 20 doll. while it is solidly built i am obviously discouraging my daughter from sitting in the chair herself (i've caught her trying to several times) because no doll chair should be expected to be that sturdy! the only real negative is the joke of a chair pad. i actually just tossed it because it doesn't really add to the toy's play value anyway and would probably just be a nuisance. i highly recommend this high chair for the child in your life who enjoys taking care of babies. it's made me look to kidkraft for more toys and doll furniture ",positive
" my son has really enjoyed the play center. it was easy to assemble and it seems to be holding up well with several children playing on it at the same time ",positive

" i purchased this at my 10 year olds request for a birthday present. i was skeptical but since it was the only thing requested i bought it. we've had it 4 weeks. what a great pool toy! kids love it! we have a 22 foot above ground pool and it works fine. i have bought floats for upwards of $25 dollars so for the cost of the wave cruiser you can't go wrong. it seems to be well built and sturdy. i wouldn't hesitate to get on it. takes 8 d batteries that are in a water tight case. it will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids. overall great gift idea ",positive
" i bought this for my niece's 5th birthday and she loved it! my nephew (8) wouldn't leave her alone he wanted to ride it. my brother-in-law got on it and it actually moved him around. it is very durable thick plastic looks like it will last a while. for the price if it lasts this summer only it is worth it ",positive

" my daughter recv'd this from her grandmother for her third b/d and i think its alot cuter than in the picture. it has worked fine for my daughter she has figured out how to work it by herself and even has shown mommy how to turn it on once in awhile. she likes playing the cds with her name in them that her grandpa got her for her b/d. the only thing i did wrong was let my daughter keep it in her room w/o me checking up on her she went and poured some kind of liquid in the storage compartments so i had to take it away as punishment. i have forgotten about it until i seen this ad which now i think i will get it back out and let her play with it again. i have even played my cds on this while cleaning the kitchen and they sounded fine. my daughter has alot of the princess furniture in her room and this really matched and is very cute and we have had no problems with this item so far. (knock on wood). ",positive
" i bought this cd player for my daughter's 5th birthday not expecting it to last a month. to my surprise it's worked wonderfully. she figured out how to operate it pretty easily and she listens to it every night before bed. we've had it for 6 months now with no problems. my favorite feature is the compartment for the cd's. it keeps them from being left lying around and getting scratched.

" dond is a fun game and we've had some lively sessions playing it. there is an additional (we forget...we got rid of it!)...complicated thing that the game had and made it less fun to play. you also have to disregard the 'suggestion' regarding how to give an banker's offer...it doesn't work so you have to use your own judgement to jiggle it...actually this makes it even more fun! all-in-all...from 6 to 60 of we whom have played (if you follow the 'disregard' suggestions)...it's a 4-star fun.

" this was strickly a replacement for an old solver that i have had. would not want to be without one as i am an avid crossword puzzle solver. many thanks for the prompt service i was given by amazon ",positive
" the developers of this game did a great job coming up with questions designed to appeal to kids questions like: if you could star in a movie which movie would you choose? if you could eat only one food for the rest of your life what would it be? the questions range from simple to a bit more complex so that kids who like challenges as well as those who don't will enjoy the game. another thing: although you can follow the rules and play this strictly as a board game we used it while we were just sitting around the table having a casual chat. sometimes the kids asked the question sometimes the adults did...but we all learned more about one another...a lot more...and many of the questions got us talking about family history memories etc. lots of fun! it'd be great to take the questions along on a trip or while eating at a restaurant since they are surefire conversation starters but not so personal that anyone's personal boundaries will be invaded. plus there are no right or wrong answers and any information provided is strictly voluntary revealing as much or as little as the respondent wants. one caveat: you will eventually go through all the questions so this game won't last forever...unless you are able to find new people to participate. if so it be used for years. in terms of fostering family closeness without any threatening or off-limits questions (in short everyone has to play nicely together) this is great!

" imaginext dinosaurs' t-rex is quite simply fun to play with. the dinosaur not only is a great toy with a lever underneath that reacts with the dino biting and yelping out a loud roar. it comes with a catapult with its respective stones (2) that the caveman (also included with accessories) can operate to save himself from the deadly bite of the dino. my 3-year old picked it up since he got it and he hasn't let go ",positive
" my little boy is a certified dino-phile to the point where he's had to teach me to pronounce several dinosaur names (ever tried saying edmontonsaurus three times fast?). but like any kid his favorite remains the t-rex tyrant lizard king. when it comes to his numerous dinosaur toys this is the most durable by far. although we've had the same problems getting this to stand at times as mentioned by another reviewer that hasn't diminished my son's enjoyment. to top it off he's come up with fun new uses for the toy too. that catapult is very good at aiming at our family cat much to my son's delight ",positive

" my son has played with these from 6 months old and still likes them occasionally (18 months now). the small car is nice for babies to shake. they don't do much but they are cute ",positive
" this is a fun toy just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels. you can ask which one is biggest what color is this car ask about the numbers on the cars etc... that is why i think it is educational to that respect. my son still has this and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along ",positive
" i got this for my 2 year old for christmas. it was a nice present he enjoys it. 2 things though it only came with 75 smaller balls so i had to purchase another 100 from somewhere else and the picture is misleading as to how big the item actually is. it could fit 2 toddlers in the pit itself and that would be max and that is two 2-3 year olds. it is comparable though to other ball pits in size and he seems to enjoy the hoop and putting the ball through the hole in big bird's ice cream cone so i feel it was worth the money especially since i didn't pay for shipping ",positive
" i got this for the price $4.99. i put it together 2 days ago and my 4 year old daughter has spent almost every waking hour playing with it. the first thing she asks me in the morning: will you play mermadia with me mommy? pretty please? the parts come off easily but do not fall off. my daughter is a little rough on her toys but since the pieces of this are easily taken apart and put back together it is great for her. she loves it.

" my [...] really likes this train puzzle. he knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it. it goes straight across and is over 10 feet long. there is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter. he will say q quail or n nut when he is putting the piece on. the pieces are easy to attach thick and very sturdy. the pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off. this would make a really nice gift for a 2-4 year old. the box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in.

" yasmin one of the super-stylin' bratz rock angelz is in my possession! so i'm sorry my reviews go in to every little detail(as one customer complained) but that's how i do it! so if you haven't bought a ticket to info-town either get the heck outta here or buy one by reading this review. here goes! first off yasmin has blonde streaks flowing through her dark chestnut hair. just like the other rock angelz(cloe jade sasha) yasmin's hair is awesome quality;smooth great duraility etc. that feature makes her great for younger kids because her hair can get messed up many times then smoothen out. yasmin has the liveliest color eyes of the rock angelz; emerald green. this works as both a strikingly gorgeous feature and hot highlight to the doll. her lip color pink really stands out on the doll. and of course as most other yasmin's do she has the warm cocoa skin color. she has dark blush and sparkles above her eyes.i absolutely adore her chocker. it is too cute! i'd definately say that her jacket has a 70's-80's rocker look to it. it's definately the best piece of clothing on this doll. just beware that it's difficult to fasten the velcro in the back. the velcro on my yasmin doll's jacket is practically coming off! underneath her jacket yasmin sports an undershirt labled 'rock angelz' with the ever-so-famous red glitter included. her jeans have no rips or anything. they're just jeans with white stitching red glitter a chain half-belt and little frayed bits at the hem. now don't get the wrong idea! just because this doll has a chain leather frays and a belly-jewel(so not a tatoo!) don't go thinking oh no! this doll portrays an image of bad things for our 'little' girls! she's just a cute rock star singing inspiring songs and wearing totally appropiate clothing. now of course if you still think this doll is innappropiate it's not my place to order you to buty this doll. i just wanted to epress my opinion;this doll is safe. anyway her black guitar is in the same mold as cloe's red one and oriana's purplish one. it's a little difficult to position her guitar correctly but not thouroughly impossible. her second outfit consists of sparkly mini and rockin concert tee. yasmin's ankle boots match with both outfits. and i love the fact that both outfits are mix-n-matchable! it rocks! literally! her accessories include:glasses 2 sets of earrings cell-phone-necklace bracelets star brush lipstick microphone/microphone stand and totally-collectible displaying stand! you've outta have a rockin' time with this rockin doll! she's 100% worth the price($19.99)! fortunately i got her for christmas. in my opinion she's appropiate and meets the standards of all ages(notice i stressed on the 'all'). you're lucky if you get her! great job mgae! chelsea&yasmin(50% my scene 50% bratz)over & out!!!!! p.s.-end the war!!! -#1 peacekeeper(hannah) 12 year old fan of my scene bratz barbie and polly ",positive
" this set was one of the most fun builds i've done with lego in a long time. as an adult fan of lego i highly recommend this set for its minifigures and part selection. they are excellent additions to any castle or general builder. as a builder the final construction is impressive in size (18+ inches long) functionality (the rotisserie chicken is quite amusing) and playability (the sea serpent's posability and the incredible catapult alone are stunning). the catapult was my favorite part. after seeing the necrotic firing action of the lego exo-force mobile defense tank's disk launcher; the rapid-fire long-range viking catapult is astonishingly fun to play with. the lone drawback in this set is the fragility of the ship's hull. it should be assembled on a hard surface (i tried to build it on carpet) and slid about on the floor not carried (it will fold in half in the air). a few extra plate elements to reinforce the hull joints would probably improve this set ",positive
" the children in our after school program love this puzzle. the colors are beautiful and they are learning about different sea creatures at the same time ",positive
" our daughter received this puzzle for her 3rd birthday. she's a puzzle nut! this became an instant favorite and had to be left together for all to see. the picture sheet in it labels all the sea creatures and it becomes a great way to discuss the different levels of life in the ocean. the coloring is beautiful - mom and dad enjoy it as well. it is extrememly well built sturdy and can really be wiped off with a damp cloth. the only negative as another viewer pointed out is the darker bottom pictures. harder for young ones to distinguish designs and not as visually appealing. ",positive
" i bought this set for my son prior to reading the other reviews online but before i tried to set it up. i will admit in reading the reviews about how difficult some people thought it was to put together that they must be exaggerating...we'll apparently they were not. i tried for 10 minutes and was covered in soap and nearly hurt myself trying to get the first two pieces together...so at that point i gave up and waited for my husbands help. the two of us spent nearly an hour banging the thing together with every tool we had(after we washed off all the soap b/c that just made getting the pieces to stay together impossible)and once we had the center base up i pushed it and it fell completely apart. we got it back together but there was no way i felt it was sturdy enought to let my child anywhere near it. so in desperation i called the toysrus store where i got it and spoke w/ the store manager. she assured me that this was not how it was supposed to be and that i should bring it back. i wasnt thrilled about that b/c it wasnt the easiest thing to get home in the first place...but what choice did i have. i asked her if they would set the next one up for me to make sure it worked b/c i wasn't about to go through this again. when i arrived at the store it was all set up and completely sturdy...exactly what i had wanted it to be when i had purchased it. unfortunatly due to its size we had to take it back apart to get it home but once we did my husband had it back together in about 10-15 minutes with just a little banging from a rubber mallett...just like some of the other reviewers had said. so the morale of the story is...if its miserable to put together then its probably defective and should go back...but once its together properly its great....now if my son would just show some interest in the darn thing all would be good with the world!

" my son has been using this table for the last 3 months and absolutely loves it. he also has the leapfrog table but gets bored with just one. this table is on the opposite side of our (toy-filled) living room and he will go over to this for a change of pace. he loves elmo and likes to hang on to his head and also mouth it. he likes to use the phone which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on everything :) - and also the little bowl under cookie monster. so why four stars and not five? i do wish the base had a bit more weight to it but he can easily pull up on it without getting the whole toy over although we've had a couple of near tips. also the toy is a little less educational than i feel it could be since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his arm...so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger but his arm could press the pig...and off elmo goes oinking and singing about pigs. still a great toy with lots of entertainment value and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs. i bought it on sale and it was worth the money ",positive
" my son got this toy for his first birthday. he's now 18 months and still loves it! when he first got it he immediately began to dance to the music. you can press certain body parts on ernie and then he sings about them (i.e. eyes mouth ears).my son can now identify his ears mouth and eyes on himself. great toy ",positive
" if you don't have this i feel bad 4 ",positive
" at first it was confusing but after you get it it is sooo much fun. and it's great for keeping your brothers out of the room ",positive
" this is fun. not easy for 5 and under but great for the rest of us. (7 - 65). gave us alot of laughs ",positive
" bought this item for mt son and he just loves it. he plays with it all the time from the time he gets home from school until dinner time and from after dinner until bed time ",positive
" i love the loop to hang elmo up to dry and my now 14 month old enjoys drawing with the soap crayons and chewing on them unfortunately. not her favorite toy but enjoyed ",positive
" my son is a college student in boston and excitedly brought this board game home on one of his breaks. you've got to play this game! he said. it had been years since anyone could even so much as coax me over to a table where a board game was being played. but i wanted to spend time with my son so i consented to learn it. turns out it was amazing! my husband 13-year-old son the bringer-of-this-new-addiction and myself must have played it 20 times in the 3 weeks he was home. the board is different every time you play it so nothing is predictable rolls of the die dictate one's success trading and strategies can get intense and the more you play it the more you definitely like it. alas! i've settled into catan mode and no longer need to beg him to bring it home from school. i bought my own house copy plus the expansion so we can get visitors hooked on it too. we play it all the time. cross my heart this is fun. as my son said you've got to play this game! ",positive
" this is a great puzzle! my son is 2 1/2 and wants to put it together almost every day! it is amazing to watch him because every time we sit down on the kitchen floor to do this together he can do it more and more on his own! and when we are done he is so proud of himself i love it! i am online right now looking for more just like it ",positive
" my 3 year old daughter got this puzzle for christmas and she simply adores it. this is her fourth melissa & doug puzzle and i have to say she loves them all. as soon as she is done with one she puts it away and runs for another one. keep making wonderful puzzles melissa & doug! ",positive
" i read some of the reviews posted on this site before i bought this doll i saw it on ebay but was afaird because of some the comments that was posted about the doll and thought i should buy it directly in case i needed to return it but i had no problems at all other then the ubc cord the direction said to turn the cord one way when actually it is the other way other then that i had no problem downloading anything and i can't wait to give this to my daughter for easter ",positive
" my almost 5 year old daughter loves this toy. it is easy for her to control. my 8 year old thinks it is boring. i don't think it has any educational value. the controller has a long pointed antenna with a plastic rounded end so the kids have to be careful not to poke each other with it. ",positive
" i am very pleased with this play food. it is very realistic looking and a great size - not too big and not too small like some of the cheaper sets. definitely recommended and well worth the money ",positive
" i bought these for my nephew as a birthday present and he absolutely loved it. he has a number of other sets bu was very excited with the content in this one. they were exactly what he wanted ",positive
" well the space is limated but i learned how to deal with it. the set comes with four parts rainforestchamber bug chamber aquarium and ant colony. the aquarium comes with triop eggs or you can put a goldfish in. then we have ant colony which the air holes are a bit to big. finally we have rain and bug chamber which to me are the best of all the four. the rain forest chamber can hold a small lizard or frog but since i bought this during winter i will have to wait till spring to catch a lizard. and we all know what you put in a bug chamber. over all i rate this four stars due to small space. p.s there a bug catcher in it as well ",positive

" i purchased this house for my in home day care. so we have lots of toddlers playing with it! they love it! the only complaint i have is that the door falls off easily if the child pushes it instead of pulls it. but the kids all fit in there and even bring chairs. even the one year old loves it! he likes to play peek a boo with the shutters. lots of fun and well worth the money ",positive
" this playset is great - my son loves it. you do have to be careful with the open sides - it is very easy to fall off. my only complaint was puting it together. the instructions are horrible and have no words - only pictures. the parts are hard to tell apart (the color-coded bolt caps all look the same in the instructions) and the pieces are hard to handle. give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get a couple of friends to help. also a power screwdriver should be a required tool to get the screws into the plastic ",positive
" this is a single player game. set up the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream truck out of traffic. the puzzles start easy and progress slowly so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting frustrated. by the end the puzzles are a challenging even for adults who have not played before. both kids love it- ages 4 and 9. we helped the four-year-old learn the tricks by just asking whoes in that cars way? then whoes in the trucks way? until she reached the car that could be moved and work her way backwards ",positive
" i bought this game based on the reviews on amazon and i am not disappointed. even my three year old enjoys this game and is capable of understanding the concept. the beginner puzzles are right up his alley and the expert puzzles are challenging enough for me. ",positive
" when i got this house i was very impressed.easy to put together.bigger than i thought it would be and it is very realistic looking.my daughter enjoys this doll house ",positive
" i've bought this toy for my daugther ( she's 6 ) and she loves it it's a good toy to use alone to share with friends or even with her parents ( myself ). it's a good option to the computer she also carries this toy with her stuff when she goes outside ",positive
" not only is the 90's game fun and enjoyable to play but the questions and answers bring back lasting memories of movies sports tv shows and meaningful events from the decade. correctly answering questions by relating them to personal memories and experiences allows all players to relive their experiences from the 90's. whether you were a student young adult or parent during the 90's this game is sure to invoke sentimental feelings. i highly recommend it for groups of friends and families ",positive
" i thought this product was very unique. it's not as advanced as ipods which is great for younger kids. although the only thing i didn't like was that it was a bit too small ",positive
" my 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it. he plays with it just about everyday. everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too. they all love trying to make baskets. the flaws are that it is loud and i wish the baseball and football did more or made noise. they don't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises. overall it's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained! ",positive
" my son loves this toy. it is the perfect height for my 14 month old (he got it when he was 12 months and it was great then too). he can play with it sitting or standing. he loves to make baskets and i can teach him numbers as the scoreboard keeps his score. he loves to spin the football and he is starting to gain enough coordination to hit the ball with the bat. he uses the bat it came with to hit other balls around the house. this toy is a family favorite ",positive
" amazon[.com] recommended this game for me based on the fact that i love the game set. unfortunately xactika bears a strong resemblance to 10 to 1 a game played with a normal deck of cards. if you already know how to play 10 to 1 xactika may seem derivative. after trying xactika once or twice we threw it in the drawer and just played 10 to 1 instead ",positive
" bought this for my boy who just turned 11. let's just say that he totally loved it and it was the first present he played with. two blinking lights on weapon. one light on helmet which makes the eyes glow. a little pricier than other bionicles but worth it. not too hard to put together just make sure you put all of the tiny pieces in a bowl or some such thing so you don't lose them while assembling the guy. the folks at lego are geniuses sure it's a franchise but they're doing a great job keeping it interesting ",positive
" i can't put it any better than the others before me have. i did a lot of research before purchasing this train and am so glad i decided to spend a little bit more money for a ton more quality. this is truly an heirloom train set that will be around longer than i will be (and i'm only 35). the other reviewers are also correct in advising that you shop around before purchasing this train set. the prices vary wildly. yes it hurts a little to spend this kind of money on a train set when you know there are others out there. however the others are cheaper for a reason... they're junk. you simply can't do better than this set ",positive
" i bought this game for my mom for christmas and we played it...right now it is in my game closet because i introduced this game to my poker friends and now we have pit night instead of poker night. we can not stop laughing when we play this game. we bring this to all get-togethers and everyone loves it.i had to buy my mom a new pit game because i take it all the time. this game is soooo much fun the more people you play with the more fun it is!!! get this game!!

" my girls love the sandbox! the only thing my husband and i don't like is that you cannot move it once the sand is in it. we thought we'd be able to but the walls are just flimsy enough that you can't. otherwise a great purchase ",positive
" i bought this sand box for my son's 1st birthday. he has had the sand box for a month and loves it. it looks really nice in our yard and the top has kept out rain and bugs. i was going to go with a cheaper sand box but now i'm glad i spent the money. this is a very good product! ",positive
" this game is so much fun!!! i do think that maybe it could use a few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels. in other words... if you are a huge star wars fan like me then you will love this game!!! it will keep you occupied for at least an hour a day if you are determined to beat a certain level. another thing i think it could use is maybe a game-save function or something... anyway great gaming experience!!! one and a half thumbs up!!!

" this is an excellent gaming system containing five acrade classics ms. pac man which plays as close to the arcade as you can get pole position which the joystick turns as a stearing wheel again close to acrade action mappy where you are a mouse trying to get a cat on the loose in a museum (much like original mario brothers) galaga-an updated space invaders type game with more difficult ships to hit and finally xevious where you are commander of a ship blowing up attaching enemies over land and see (plays like tiger heli for nintendo or other games like this). i use this on my old call room tv with mono av jacks available works great passes the time with family friendly games. these games are much better than some of the new expensive games. check this out you will be pleasently surprised and for around 6-12 dollars good deal. runs on 4 aa batteries then plug and play ",positive
" my son got this for christma when he was 10 months old. from day one he loves to push it around the house. he's 13 months old now and he can get on to ride it. his friends love it also. ",positive
" someone gave these to us when my son was 9 months old. he loved holding them and it has been fun watching him learn to color and develop his hand-eye coordination. he is now 22 months old and we've just used them up and i had to buy the crayola tub crayons because i couldn't find these at toys r us. the crayola crayons are thinner (which doesn't hold up as well to toddler abuse) and have more colors but i like these better because they come with the ducky sponge to wash the crayon off the walls (my son loves that part too). these crayons are a surefire way to get my son into the bathtub ",positive
" the nephews loved it. we sent it to them along with other gifts for christmas. turns out the twin 8 year olds found this to be their favorite gift. the light up part was pretty cool but they did have some trouble bouncing the ball. when the lights went out the fun really happened. everything went well even when it turned into tackle-basketball. not their mom's favorite sport but no harm... no foul. ",positive
" this hoop is tight but wene you shoot it makes a ton of noise. if your planing on buying this be aware of a lot noise. also the hoop and the net sometimes come off ",positive
" this eeyore is so much fun. i gave it a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose but if mom and dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach baby to keep them together i think there is also something to be learned with this plus the fact that he is so darn cute and the little voice is sweet and soothing. good night baby. just precious. baby quickly learns that eeyore only works with the butterfly rattle. i thought the ears would be easy to break but they have taken a lickin' from my grandson and still work. nana ka ",positive
" my 2 year old daughter (and our 4 & 6 year old neighbors) love this toy! i had it up during my daughter's second birthday party and all the kids loved it! it holds up very well and i have only had to refill it once (and that was only because one of the kids managed to pull out the plug). some of the balls are not 100% inflated but they still roll just fine and my daughter has the best time with this. it is up in the living room and not outside so that keeps it from getting any other holes. i would recommend this for any kids around 4 or under. the one thing to keep in mind; the kids may be afraid of it at first; my daughter was terrified of it the first day but by the second she loved it and now she spends a lot of time in there ",positive
" sooo cute. santa gave my 7 y.o. daughter the dog and cat versions of this game. she and i have already spent several hours playing with her pets. unlike the earlier pets there is more to do than just care for your pet. there are games activities and interactions with pet friends. there is a whole village of homes and places to visit. you collect stickers throughout your adventures. for instance there are 29 stickers available for making friends. it is represented by a heart sticker. everytime you collect a sticker you are taken to your sticker book and it indicates how many stickers are available and how many you have obtained. there are three exterior buttons for use to play with groom and feed your pet. when your pet ignores you it means it is time for grooming playing or eating. sometimes your pet will suddenly disappear and then reappear at their potty mat having left a little undesirable. my daughter thinks that is hilarious. kids! the only drawback is that the screen does not light up for play while travelling after dark. maybe they'll improve upon that in the next versions ",positive
" the game pieces are very good quality. i found the cards to be challenging. the game was well worth the money. ",positive
" my 2yr old got this one and another imaginext dinosaur for christmas and this one is by far his favorite. he loves attaching the cart to the mammoth and moving them around. the reason why i give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy. when you think it's pushed down all the way you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise. also like the last reviewer i think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean. but overall the toy is fun and very durable ",positive
" these coins are nice and heavy... they have a good feeling when you hold them or keep them in the pouch. my son uses them like jack sparrow does in the movie so he doesn't die in our play battles. however they seemed rather expensive after buying them and having them shipped. it would be cheaper to use silver dollars or other real us currency that is large and heavy ",positive
" my 6 & 8 year olds sons received this toy for christmas. they are huge pokemon fans so just the fact that it has pokemon pictures on it made the toy worth it. fortunately it also happens to be fun to play. 2 to 4 players try to allow the fewest balls possible past their own paddles. the fewest points wins. each player has their own scorekeeper for up to 5 games. setting up the game after every round gets a little tedious however it's not so bad if everyone helps. the 2 best things for me are that i don't mind playing (unlike the actual pokemon cards which are a boring nightmare for me!) and it doesn't require batteries!! my 3 year old daughter likes to play too although she loses every time. we just don't tell her. if your kids like pokemon this is a good toy ",positive
" my 4 year old son loves all things rescue hero! his grandparents got the macc for him almost a year ago now. i run an in home day careso i watch not only my son but 2 other 5 year old boys and my youngest son 13 mo and a 10 mo old boy! they all love it! this thing has stood up to all of their adventures! one of the kids i watch was thrilled when he got the same macc for his birthday from his parents! he had just went on and on about it and they couldn't resist. it is very large but we already had the firetruck police car helecoptor and about 30 rescue heroes soin the words of my son we just had to get this too! i highly recommend this toy for all ages! great imaginary play ",positive
" this toy was an instant success with my son who is six. he figured out how to put together the track in minutes. unlike other construction toys skyrail is not limited to one or two designs. my son can create endless configurations including loop-the-loops that really work. this toy is also easy to disassemble. the track and connectors seem a little flimsy but so far -- after many many uses -- none of the pieces has broken ",positive
" when i was a little girl i stood along beside the table and watched the adults play. this was how i learned how to play the game. i have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above (90's style). unfortunately they have changed the style of the cards on us and i would like to purchase the 90's style. if any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that i can buy some. i really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me ",positive
" just as promised. our son loves the wiggles plate bowl and cup! perfect ",positive
" as usual this is another quality product from power wheels. the fit and finish is perfect and the overall quality is excellent. the only upgrade i can advise is to buy the power wheels 12v quick charger for the battery ",positive
" we bought our youngest son the pirate ship seven years ago when he was four. he is now eleven and is asking for this new updated ship. he has played with the old one for years outside in the pool inside along with the big king castle and countless other sets that we have. yes playmobil. is delicate and young children can be taught how to play with it there are alot of small pieces but like lego it will and does encourage a child's imagination rather than stifle it. we have castles western forts city sets boats all of it! it does take time to put together but some of the best memories are of me and my boys putting together some of these intricate playmobil sets the day after christmas! when you buy toys for your kids don't look at a toy and say what does it do rather look at a toy and ask what can my child do with this toy? playmobil has been one of the toys that my three boys have stayed with along with legos well past christmas much more than anything else. i am keeping all of our collections for our grandchildren. ",positive
" i purchased this pirate ship for my son's fourth birthday. this is by far the most popular toy in our house! my 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter also love this toy. there are so many items that come with the ship - from canon balls swords treasure chest full of goodies food animals and even jewelery for the pirates - they are never bored. my four year old plays on his own or with his friends and when all three are home they all play together. definitely worth the investment for the amount of joy this toy has brought to our home! ",positive
" my 6-year-old got this for christmas and he and his 4-year-old brother love it! they enjoy doing the battles and coming up with different monster combinations. it teaches strategy since they have to figure out which combinations work best. my kids also like to just play with the figures by themselves like action figures. a piece of advice though: this game only comes with 2 figures so you really must buy additional figures or it won't be much fun since the point is to create varying combinations. therein lies the problem - or at least my problem! i can't find the extra figures for this thing! luckily they were available around christmas so i got some then but now i can't find them in stock anywhere. also i have not had any durability problems although i had some sound quality problems on the 2nd day. fortunately it turned out that all i needed was new batteries. you really need alkalines for this game. overall it's what my boys think though and they adore this!!! ",positive
" not only will this be a fun gift for our 5 year old grandson it will be a fun gift for our 65 year old brother-in-law! quite realistic looking! it works great on smooth surfaces but doesn't do well on carpet. our dogs got a big kick out of it ",positive
" there are always problems with an any type of bed even an inflatable one. i am actually 21 but i don't have a credit card so i had to use the kid review instead. this bed is great. of course there are problems but they don't outweigh the good that the bed has. it is great to sleep on you can carry it on trips you can have it on another bed that is in one place or on the floor. i do admit it is somewhat hard to set up but it is worth the effort for the sleep is unparralleled. i sleep on it every night and i have had no problems with it at all. i recomend this bed to be for ages 5 to adult because of the gap it has between the side and the mattress. what is the most important thing of all is this: is the person you bought it for happy with it ",positive
" we love the accessories this item comes with but the doll itself is... we have mixed feelings about her. my daughter 4 loves her hair because it's so different from all her other barbies but she hates her feet. her feet are way too big even bigger than ken's (my daughter tried making her wear ken's shoes but it didn't work). another thing we love and hate about her is that her hands can move like pregnant midge (good) and she has a bigger body than most barbie dolls (bad because she can't use the other doll's clothes) ",positive
" i originally bought this monkey on vacation. i showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it. how could i not buy it for him doing that? it was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies. i eventually ordered a 2nd one from amazon for my parents house. so now i don't have to drag it from house to house. as he gets older he is liking it more and more ",positive
" my 5 year old daughter got this monkey when she was little and has slept with it every night since. my 1 year old daughter loved her big sister's monkey so we had to get her one of her own. she loves it and sleeps with her monkey every night now ",positive
" i got this for my 15 month son. he really loves it! he doesn't use it as a ride-on yet (more fun will await!) but he pushes the car from the back handle everywhere inside & out. there are alot of buttons which make sounds and some have the car talk back. the oil change sounds are his fav. he also enjoys the toy phone(when you put it in the slot it rings and the car answers!) there is also a small storage section under the seat.. the only thing i wish it did have was a horn sound instead of one of the many car's sayings. for the price it is a great interactive toy!! and for a boy who usually is not big on his toys for very long this still captures his attention months afterward!.oh and this toy can take a beating! no complaints whatsoever! a great find ",positive
" i run an afterschool program. this game is a big hit with the 3rd through 5th graders. they play it so much i bought an extra game in the tin. they can't get enough of it ",positive

" i bought this for my children's room which has an outer space theme. the planets are nicely done and look great. no they don't glow in the dark all night long... but who wants their kids room lit up all night anyways?!?! they certainly glow long enough for both of my boys to fall asleep! we have a round ceiling light which i put triangular rays around which is now our sun. i'm giving this 4 stars only because i agree about the sticker stars... yeah... they kinda stink. but the plastic glow-in-the-dark stars are easy to find (i've even seen them in pharmacy's) and inexpensive. we put up 2 packages of the plastic ones and added the sticker stars from the package. it gives the effect of stars which are closer and farther away!! ",positive
" the 3-d solar system is great. i rated it 5 stars because i knew there was no sun so this product was exactly what i expected. easy to hang up glows well my 6 year old son is very happy with it! a sun would be nice but still well worth the money ",positive
" this is the ultimate in home laser tag fun. it has great range and accuracy for hours of exciting but harmless fun. get your kids away from the tv games and into the real (figuratively speaking) thing. if you have two kids make sure you but at least 4 guns. once you receive them you'll experience the need for the two extra guns. everyone who sees them will want to play. great toy thanks amazon.

" i just got the laser tag master blaster a few days ago and i love it. i've had my eye on it ever since i got the deluxe for my b-day back in september. i was looking on amazon so frequently for the price to drop that i got tired of watching so i stopped for a few months. then spring came and i got into playing laser tag again with my little brother. i was suddenly filled with an urge to buy the ltmb. i looked back on amazon and...boom! 60 percent off! 20 bucks! i told my mom and dad about it and they said that i could get one. so the next day we began the ordering process on amazon through toys r us. we checked the shipping charges and...bam! 15 greens! so we just figured on our next trip into town we could just go to toys r us and see if it would be the same price. it was (minus the 15 bones for s&h). so we picked up a few and went home. after reading the instructions a million times and doing a few tests i finally figured out how they work. i also found out that they are very much like the deluxe except for the shoulder stock the sights the fully automatic feature the 3 shot burst the shot range the text messages and who could ever forget the rocket. let me explain the laser tag master blaster to you: this large tagger is much better for a very large playing field. the deluxe and the irt-2x models are better for smaller areas. the ltmb's laser has a shot range of up to one thousand feet. the laser has three different shot types: the single (fire one shot) the 3-burst (fire a burst of 3 shots no overheatage) and the fully automatic (fire non-stop). you can also send text messages (up to 10 characters long) to your teammates and opponents. retreat...behind you...gotcha...ouch! the rocket is awesome. just load pump and launch simple as that. with just twenty pumps the rocket can sail over forty feet blasting everyone in a 15 to 20 foot radius. there is a lot more to the ltmb but it would take to long to type so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself.

" this product was highly recommended by a school teacher in the uk as a great teaching tool. it was well received as a gift by the children and their parents. an excellent math teaching tool that the children love. it is portable user friendly and has something for those on many different levels so much so that one father an engineer loves to play the game by himself when travelling and is equally enjoyable to his 7 year old son as well as a game that they can play together. math whiz is a tool that creates a friendly math experience which can be used for many years as the upgrading levels will remain a challenge ",positive
" i bought this for my nephew's first birthday and my sister told me that he loves it. when he gets up from a sleep it is the first thing he wants to play with and with him being at the stage where he is trying to stand up; it is a great motivator to encourage him to stand. your kids will love this toy and the sounds and lights will keep your child amused for hours ",positive
" ...and they are working out great with our thomas layouts. melissa & doug products continue to impress me with their high quality and typically provide great educational value. these are educational and your children will learn things like police station fire station hospital school town hall grocery store and post office. there are several different shapes too including squares rectangles triangle and the various signs. the buildings and most of the roof pieces only have the building design on one side. the trees ambulance fire truck and mail truck are large and double sided. the various street signs and passenger cars are a little small and as the box states ages 3+ and up i would consider these smaller pieces a choking hazard. the larger pieces are enjoyed by both my 1 yr old and my 3 yr old. the rectangles are the largest piece in the set and measure 4 3/4 by 2 1/4 approx. squares are roughly 2 1/4 x 2 1/4. these blocks are not as heavy as i expected but still nicely made and bright colorful additions to playsets like thomas/brio train sets. if your children don't insist on the real thing this is a great way to save some money and still buy a quality product. the only drawback is the wooden storage box doesn't come with a sliding plexi cover like the melissa & doug pizza set or beading set does. that would be really nice for storage and secure those little pieces that we don't use ",positive
" this game is very easy to learn. each of the 16 playing pieces has 4 attributes height (tall & short) color (white and brown) shape (circle & square) and hollow/solid. the goal is to get 4 of the same attributes in a row (for example you could have 1 tall white circle 1 short white circle 1 tall brown circle and 1 short brown circle in a row and that would be a winning set because they are all circles even though they vary with respect to the other attributes). the catch is that your opponent picks the piece you have to place on the game board. this game is similar to set in that you are trying to make winning patterns across several attributes. it is different because you are also trying to block your opponent from making winning patterns. i do wish this game were less expensive so that more people can enjoy it. not everyone can drop $30 for a game. it is a beautifully made wooden game but it would be just as much fun if it were made of something inexpensive and priced under $10. nevertheless it is a game worth owning. and for trivia buffs this game was futuristic enough to appear in an episode of star trek voyager :) ",positive
" this game is very exciting for my son he is five i am teaching him to read his blends and this is a great reinforcer. i enjoy watching him do the math (one with the coins) as well as watching him make words. ",positive
" it is fun! and most importantly educational. it has a game where you have to put the exact amount of money in the game slot. my kids like that part. they are 6 and 7 and ask me all the time if they can play their spongebob game we are a two leapster family but they have to share their cartridges. next year my youngest will want one too i am sure as she wants to play theirsbut she is just too little yet another year she will be 4 so will check into getting her one of her own then..

" i don't know why poor scrat got so many bad reviews. my kids absolutely love this toy. they laugh hysterically every time and they're 4 1/2 and 7. he does have a tendency to fall down and doesn't scoot very well. but the laugh factor alone makes this well worth the money. ",positive
" ok this toy does not deserve 5 stars but the other reviews were far too harsh. the first 30 minutes of my chihuahua terrified by this thing were worth the price. as a stuffed animal it's very cute but not too cuddly because it's hard plastic under the fur. i love scrat in the movie and the sounds this thing makes are quite funny at first but the do get boring soon unless you have a family pet to terrorize like i do. here's another trick. put scrat on a pillow with your hadn behind him so you can make him move and wiggle his tail without being seen then have someone bring in the family pet. when i lunged at the dog's feet he screamed as being run through a meet grinder. this may sound cruel but i assure you the dog was not hurt and now enjoys showing scrat who's the boss whenever we turn him on ",positive

" my three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection. we didn't use it as a game. you can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties. each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them. yes the frosting won't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play! box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue. would buy this again. great for kids with imaginations ",positive

" i wrote some reviews of lila doll saying she is my favorite but this one is extremly pretty. her face is so pretty and all her clothes and cute. i say diffrent i say that lila is better than polly! lila also comes with a cute horse and carrige. wow how can you think spending 25 dollars on polly will be better when you can spent less than 10 dollars on lila and get a real cute and worth-the-money doll ",positive
" most old skool fans are angry he's not a vw beetle anymore. i kinda never liked beetles anyway so im happy with the new unlicenced thing. it looks like a mix of a mini and a peugeot. he transforms better than most the picture does'nt do him justice it makes him look stiff. actually for how bulky he is he's amazingly bendable i particularly like that his door/shields are'nt attached to his arm their on a cuffling that rotates so they wont be too awkward like many of the others with door/shields. the jetski jetpack adds an unneeded extra flair to an already awesome robo mode. and as an extra retro touch it has a tempurture sensitive decal on his chest/top of the car that must be held for a minute before it will reveal the autobot logo [just like his original 80s version]. i do wish he had come with some sort of weapon but i have a few other transformers from this same generation that don't really need both that they came with. what's even more awesome for me is that i bought this at the grocery store as one of the very few toys they had in thier christmas section for $10 if your looking for just any one good transformer bumblebee is a good choice. if you have optimus this one looks great standing beside him. transformer fans don't delay pick this one up! i can't wait to see movie's camaro bumblebee in july ",positive

" even though i'm convinced that all monitors work differently in different locations this model has treated us well. we got this monitor (with dual receivers) for my first daughter 3 1/2 years ago and it was always clear & crisp. reception was perfect in the basement in the frontyard in the backyard...even at the neighbor's house. one of the receivers konked out after about 2 years but we survived with only one. the second receiver finally stopped working last week & after doing waaaaayyyy too much internet research i decided to go with the same trusty inexpensive monitor and it works great! i've never slept with a monitor in our room (because our babies stay with us for a long time) so i don't know about nighttime quirks. i keep the monitor in our kitchen area to listen for the little one waking up from naps....and to spy on the girls when they play upstairs without me. :) baby #3 is on the way & i'm sure this monitor will last another 3 years until we don't need it anymore. so $40 over the course of 3 children isn't bad!

" my husband and i travel a lot and someone told us about this on one of our last cruises.. we actually watched 2 people playing it as well. so my husband actually remembered the name of this game and got this for me for a christmas gift. surprised me!! we plan on taking it with us on all our trips. we will be able to use it on cruises on planes wherever we may have to play the waiting game. we know its good for 2 people on up!!! it seemed like a fun game ",positive

" bought this one recently for my eight year old (and myself) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it. more challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games. i highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing thinking spatially understanding the consequences of a move or moves and introducing the concept of strategy ",positive
" my six month old grandson loves these toys! they are perfect for the teether and he loves the colors and noise. they hold his attention for much longer than some of his other toys. they are easy for him to hold and shake. i would buy them again in a minute. ",positive
" my son and i thoroughly enjoyed assembling and learning about how robots work. this kit may be frustrating for one adult or child to assemble. the screws require more 'adult strength' (he would start them and i would finish) and some of the instructions might need at least 3 hands to hold and assemble. but hey that is why it was so enjoyable - we did it together! it is fun now to watch him play with it and tell everyone 'my dad and i built this' ",positive

" this is my daughters first real baby doll. she is almost 2 and i have never seen her love another toy like this one. she loves to give the baby kisses and feed her with the bottle it comes with and i bought an extra outfit so she can change the baby for bed. this doll is really pretty compared to other baby dolls i have seen lately. the skin is a very soft nice feeling plastic with a cloth torso and smells like sweet baby powder! i was pleased when i was able to wipe off dirt that was on the dolls hand really easily. i love all the accessories that you can get for the little mommy dolls too. i highly recommend this one ",positive
" we recieved this bed as a hand-me-down from a friend's child who used it until he was eight (would not give it up sooner). my son recieved the bed at two-years-old and is now four. this bed is durable! the bed we have is twelve years old and looks brand new. it is so easy to wipe clean. my son feels that his bed is special and just adores it. he sees regular beds other places and feels so proud that his bed is a blue race car. i have a feeling he'll want to stay in this bed until his feet are hanging off the end. five stars ",positive

" i purchased this as a christmas gift for my 1 year old nephew. very pleased with the online price through toys-r-us and amazon.com it was $50.00 less than in a retail store! very prompt shipping had to be put together but not difficult with common household tools. very nice quality wagon top of the line and well worth the money. rubber tires give a more comfortable ride for small children. i also purchased the pad set. fits perfectly looks great nad comfy ride but be sure to purchase the pad set for the model #29 all-terrain cargo wagon (bp-29) as other pad sets will not fit! very nice onverall. don't hesitate to buy!

" this elmo item is pretty cool. if ur child is an elmo fan then im sure you know how annoying these elmo doll/ toys can be.. oh jeez the voice is so loud and it echoes.!!! however this one is far less annoying than the rest because he hums when you plug his mouth -- im srry i meant ta say when you give him his pacifier (lol)-- you just hear an adorable hum sound. overall this is a cool gift. theres is an off button i only wish there was a lower volume button for early morning play ",positive

" this wagon was easy to put together. we use it frequently when picnicking outdoors and going to the park. it is big enough for my 2 year old to lie down and take a nap. it was also large enough to hold our lunch cooler and my daughter. it is very easy to pull around and is very durable ",positive
" we absolutely love this wagon! my 2yr old will ride as long as i want to walk stop detour whatever...she's glued! it is huge & on the heavy side. but also huge(you can carry so much/many children)w/ great quality & durability. i can easily see us w/ this wagon for years to come & would suggest it to anyone comparing.

" i purchased the parents magazine version first and my one year old son didn't play with it much but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this hasbro toy i purchased it and he has been playing with it ever since. the buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it with both hands and press buttons at the same time. he also enjoys teething on the keys. i highly recommend this product for mothers who want to hold on to their own keys ",positive

" this mcqueen is different than the regular mcqueen - slightly darker maroon with a white swoosh on both sides - it is supposed to be the mcqueen that appears after the radiator springs team fixes him up...my son was slightly disappointed though because the wheels were not white. i found out there was yet another mcqueen with the whitewall tires. go figure ",positive
" i say that because the paint on these cars chips very easily. the hamm car was already chipped sealed in the package. my son's matchbox cars which get tossed into their basket quite regularly don't seem to chip near as easy as the cars ones do. never-the-less kids don't care. though my son (who is only 3-1/2) is wondering why they didn't make a red ramone or the announcer cars (bob and darryl)?? also for collectors the sarge and fillmore are shown on the back of the card as being sold as individual items but on the back of the hamm card they are not shown. i have as of yet see them sold individually on the supercharged card ",positive

" the v4 the newest american tamagotchi is much like its previous japanese counterparts the entama and uratama. this tamagotchi goes to school interviews for jobs and then has a career. each career has its own game so there are many more games on this tama than the v3. there is also a mail icon that flashes when your tama gets mail.

" i read the reviews before buying this product and i do agree that it is messy with the markers suitable for children that are a little older. it is fun and very cute but a little messy to wash off. i just buy a pack of baby wipes at the dollar store and let the kids clean off the screen with them and then throw them out. it works wonderfully and the problem is solved since the included sponge is not very helpful. i would purchase this again especially for the price ",positive
" anything leappad is great . its one of the best things to come from the computer toy area for kids yet. my son is ahead of his class in reading with the help of leappad. at 6 he reads at a midrange grade 1 student and is progressing quickly. i highly recommend this and any other leap pad book and toy . most schools have dropped phonics from the classrooms and leappad has brought it back in a fun form your little one will love..

" i would recommend this game to any and everyone completely. i would have to say if there are choppy portions on your dvd player then it might be time to buy a newer dvd player. ours was flawless ran so smoothly and it's sooo much fun. most fun with multiple people but still fun with a few. i would only hope that in the future they put a few more games and also maybe full motion video instead of pictures of products. never got tired of the game and like i said i recommend it to everyone. thanks b. wolf west chester p ",positive
" the game itself is actully pretty good. you can go through the entire price is right game or you can just go to each section. like if you just wanted to do the pricing games there's that option or you can do the showcase showdown etc... there are times that the graphics of the game lag which is kind of odd since to me since i wasn't playing it on a computer but on my dvd player. the pricing games are 'random' but you do tend to get some of the same games more than other games. you can technically play this game by yourself but it's obviously going to be more fun the more people you have ",positive
" my daughter got this for her 6th birthday. she absolutely loves it as does her 3 year old sister. one of them is using it all the time. the 3 different tops on the wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old as she can't switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else switch the tops for her. my 6 year old has caught onto all of the dance moves and is able to do them along with the dvd. my 3 year old can't do them all but she has a great time just doing what she can. both of my girls love cinderella so they put on their dress up cinderella dresses whenever they do the dvd. i wish there was a way to order just an extra mat though so they could do the dvd together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on the mat ",positive
" this is a toy that my son always wants to play with and we've had this dinosaur for quite a while now. usually we buy our son a toy that he pleads for (he likes it soooooo much) and it looks like fun but then it ends up in the back of his closet after a few days of playing with it. this brontosaurus makes a booming sound with his feet when you pull a trigger underneath which both my sons love (4 & 2) and the included figures are great. this toy stands up to the brutual tug of war that accompanies our two small boys and it is quite the bargain at the price. i highly recommend all of the dinosaurs and cavemen in this series. not only does it keep my sons busy (oh yeah) but it also helps built their imagination as i hear them tell each other all these stories about their dinosaurs. imaginext has even come out with new dinosaurs in this line which can be found at target or other stores (i have found that tru has a limited selection).

" it was the most popular gift on his first birthday. he loved pushing it sitting on it and moving the small animal figures. lots of different kinds of fun for him ",positive
" this is a nice toy for kids to ride on. my daughter loves the little horn. there are some little figurines that go inside the seat which activate the music. that does not work well at all. there are also little toy holders for the figuerines but those never get used either. it's a cute riding toy but a lot of the features don't work well. worth the buy if a family is really into the john deere theme ",positive
" this is a great doll--we gave it to our 2-year-old daughter last week and she now carries her everywhere feeds her reads to her puts her to bed covers her with a blanket and obsessively pats her on the back and tush. she's quite cuddly and soft; you'll want to hold her yourself. you might expect from the pictures that the arms and legs would be hard plastic like the head but in fact they are very soft and pliable and the trunk of the body is all cloth like a pillow with a bean-bag tushie. the headband is removable but actually stays on there pretty well. the eyes don't have those stupid eyelids you usually see on baby dolls the ones that open and shut when you lift the doll and that always seem to stop working properly after a couple of weeks. we'll see how maria holds up to the kind of punishment our daughter can mete out but she seems pretty durable. what a great purchase! ",positive
" i agree that the denver reviwer is totally out to lunch. this doll greatly resembles my daughter's friend jenny liu. jeeny was born in taiwan. chinese people don't look any one way and to expect them to is racist like saying they all look alike. the hair ornaments are plastic but they do look good . the dress looks redder when you display her out of the box.fabric quality is better than average for mattel. her hair is also much nicer and has more style than mattel had been giving us. i think this doll bodes well for better things to come in this doll series.

" the big bubbler is the greatest bubble wand----we have had consistently huge bubbles with the top-of-the-line/expensive bubble solution as well as the cheapest $1.99 jugs. the only thing that didn't work at all for us was straight dish detergent (hey we were desperate). my youngest toddler will chase the bubbles endlessly and even a neighbor's preteen son couldn't resist chasing the large bubbles across our yard. i also like that i am playing with the kids when i make the bubbles for them vs. simply turning on a battery-operated machine and then standing back. if i had to gripe it would only be to say that i wish the top of the wand (the end that holds the bubble solution) could be stood on end. it is hard for the little ones to keep the top from spilling while waving the wand; it is also tough for them to get the wand back into the top to get more bubble solution. we also go through a lot of solution---i plan to buy a few large jugs of it to have it on hand. but this seems like a minor inconvenience given how much fun we have all had watching the bubbles dance all over our yard ",positive
" i am confused by the poor reviews of this product. my daughter received this toy from the easter bunny this year and the whole family plus grandparents/aunts/uncles etc. have had a ball with it. it creates huge bubbles round or long that float in the air for quite a bit of time. i do agree that the solution runs out very quickly and it is too hard for a three year old to work...but for the price i have to say this toy is well worth it! we also made our own solution (granny's recipe) and it worked...very messy and sudsy though. i would recommend this product to anyone who loves bubbles ",positive
" my 8 yr old grandson wanted this for christmas but the price was over $100 so when i saw it for under $15 on amazon i got it for his birhtday in february. he and his 9 yr old brother love it! i also purchased one booster pack at the same time. then i found another game and booster pack at target for a very reasonable price. so he got the game system two games and two booster pack of cards all for under $50.00! both he and i were happy! (the only reason i give this a 4 is because the games are a bit hard to come by ",positive
" i bought this game for my 7 year old last winter - because he loved the book so much. he quickly mastered the game which requires you to earn state cards by recognizing certain items about each state such as the color of the card whether the capital starts with a certain letter or if the state nickname has a person's name embedded in it. all his friends liked the game when they came over so i ended up buying and giving at least 6 more as birthday presents for his friends and for a niece and nephew. but more than that this game has spawned a further interest in geography in my son. he began playing with a wooden puzzle of the usa as a result of the information on the game cards. in doing so he taught himself most of the capitals (which are also on the game cards) and the shapes of the various states. he continues to want to learn more about us geography. i highly recommend the book and game for ages 5 and up.

" my granddaughter loves the buckets. they are large and easy for little hands to pick up. they make great hats and are great for putting things in as well as for the coordination of putting them on top of each other. the colors are bright and the plastic is sturdy. a great gift for little ones and older ones as well.

" while nothing beats wood blocks (in my opinon) we had these first and they are fun! we like that they are flexible and easy for little hands to manipulate and not painful if they fall on you! the only downside is that they are large and storing them in the bag is like putting together a puzzle-they just fit. storing them in a toy box fills the box with wasted space; so we stack them in 4 rows beside the toy box. it's worth the hassle if you have space for them and don't mind stacking them up and teaching your little one to ",positive
" after assembling a dora's talking cash register that scans the wrong items a dora's talking backpack that is just plain dumb- this is the toy that scored this christmas! this toy is easy for my 3 year old to maneuver the pony in and out of the walker and actually works like you would expect. plus the pony is fun to play with out of the walker. my daughter doesn't even question why it only talks in the walker. so what if it doesn't! it will be fun to sleep with because it is soft and has pajamas on. i would recommend this toy- very cute and fun!

" we love this game. we were first introduced to it at our children's preschool where it fast became a favorite at free choice time. the children engaged in it delightfully and playfully. everyone has fun. the game board is durable and can be constructed differently over and over again -- this works out so great because with all the repeated play ours gets the kids are not memorizing the spot the item was. i worried a little that it might be too competitive and those that were better at it might leave those not as quick at hunting feeling discouraged but have not ever found that to be the case when we have the game out at home or at the school. the board is brightly colored the items are fascinatingly fun to search for. it is a challenge even for us big kids. i would recommend it highly for a fun family activity game ",positive

" this is a good toy for a toddler not a baby. i've used this toy in two different setting (first as a nanny and then as a mom) and both times the babies were terrified of it. it's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old. the balls fly everywhere and you've got to run about after them to keep it going; unless of course you've got a toddler then they can run about after the balls (which seems to be half the fun for them). good toy but not until maybe 14 months.

" i purchased both of the mega bloks pyrates ships and have built two other mega bloks vessals before namely the man-o-war models from the dragons line and they wer both more difficult to construct than this one so if you want a challege try finding them instead. the first thing i noticed when i opened it up was the lack of pieces in the set almost the entire ship simply snaps together a ten-year-old could do it. there isn't a lot of rigging like in the playmobil series that will keep coming undone either. all in all it can be assembled in 30 min to an hour. the finished products are full of detail and mega bloks has gotten better at it each time anyone who follows their dragons line will know what i mean. i'll post a review of the phantom next and i caint wait to get the privateer ship blue beard's avenger it looked massive at toy fair. with the pirates of the caribbean 2 and 3 films coming out this line is sure to be a hit ",positive
" my 14 mo old son just got his go kart today. he loves it. he loves pushing the button and making it go. he hasn't figured out the steering yet but we have a long straight entry way to our home so no need to steer yet. my 4 yr old daughter also loves it and fits into it just fine (about 40 in tall and 35 lbs). she received the razor go kart herself and loves it but that one is outside only. they have had the best time today playing with the pw go kart. i agree with other reviewers that holding down the button is hard for little ones but they figure out ways to get around it. (the razor go-kart also has a thumb throttle control) we got the lil quad 4 wheeler for my daughter when she was one and would still ride it if she didn't have the big 4-wheeler. now both kids can ride their 4-wheelers together or their go karts. thanks santa for 2 great gifts ",positive

" being a preschool teacher i use these all of the time. i have found that taking the sheets out individually clipping them to the easels clip to be the best way to work with them. even if you don't have an easel these are wonderful for children of all ages. large unlined sheets of paper encourage children to be creative and to express themselves in a completely original way. for infants toddlers and preschoolers i will often tape the sheets to the table and let them color/paint/glue to their hearts delight ",positive

" i bought this for christmas for my three children ages 4 (twins) and 18 mos. although the younger child doesn't really get the games we play with it the older ones do and we all have a great time. my goal was to get them to be active during the winter (less tv time) and this works for about 30 minutes. i only wish we had a bigger house so i could have gotten the bigger parachute. i can't wait to play with it outside when it gets warm ",positive

" these are really cute and a great alternative to the standard numbers and letters version of these foam tub toys. my 2 and 3-year old sons enjoy playing with them. no complaints here ",positive
" i bought this set for my 3.5 year old. we have had a great time putting it together on several occasions in the last couple of weeks. once put together my son imagines adventures on it with the included soldiers. i am not very mechanically inclined but the instructions are excellent well-illustrated and clear and i had no problem with them. (my only quibble is that the orange sticks in the manual are a different shade of color from the ones in our set and took a moment to identify.) at first my son just wanted to put together the foam walls but the second time around he wanted to help constructing the walls of the castle. by imitating me he was able to make duplicate versions of some simple structures rather well. he also figured out how to make the soldiers all by himself with their arms legs helmets swords and shields. through doing the set i also was able to explain that you have to build the foundation first before you can put in the walls and floors and the third time we made the castle he was repeating this point to me! the drawbridge is really fun and well-done. it raises and lowers very smoothly. this particular set is really only designed to make the castle so it's not really meant for making many different things like the other superstruct sets. but this was our first one and i have no regrets. assembly time was about 30 minutes the first time but after you do it once it seems closer to 15 minutes. the pieces are high-quality fit very well and are generally a joy to handle and see. the castle looks great once assembled and will impress any adults or kids who see it ",positive
" i bought this wireless weather station as a gift. the recipient loves it. for the price he is really enjoying it. the only things he would change are: -interface to computer so that data could be tracked -display of actual barometric pressure value these two features are available on more expensive models so i imagine in the future we will be upgrading ",positive

" both my 3-year old daughter and my 5-year old son (to his father's chagrin) love playing with and endlessly dressing dora. her outfits are darling and my children enjoy mixing and matching (or not-so-matching in some cases) the clothes too. we are looking forward to adding new outfits as well as the armoire and bed - dora needs a place to sleep! dora is well made and sturdy and her clothing has even been through the wash and no harm done. and i have to admit ... i've been known to dress dora a time or two myself. we have the same problem with the shoes not staying on well but it doesn't seem to bother my little ones at all ",positive
" this product was exactly what i was looking for. i recieved it in a timely manner and the merchant communicated kindly and proactively with me about the shipment. thanks ",positive
" bought this for our girls 2 and 4. huge hit even before the batteries were put in the blow dryer. this set is great for several reasons and i'll try to list the top few. first the dryer actually has a little fan in it that whirrs loudly enough to seem real but not so loud as to disturb the cat when she is getting her fur done. (uncommon for a kid's toy) also the nail polish and eyeshadow are both made to open and use but no mess. and once you have removed the inner packing materials the bag is large enough for headband and tiara storage. a must for today's princess. the one thing i will caution you about is the curling iron. if your child has longer hair like my girls do it can get tangled when hair is being curled. fortunately the curler has no moving parts so tangles are discovered long before any permanent damage is done. all in all a pretty sturdy little set for $15. great for practice make-overs and such but probably not for experienced princesses as there is no actual make-up involved just imagination. perfect for my house! no glittery door handles or perfumed pets! ",positive
" why do some people call bratz dolls 'sluts/slutz'? are you guys mad? they are just dolls. they are made of plastics. so what they wear short mini skirt? they just dolls. if you hated mini skirt soooo much well don't wear them. i saw many teenage celebs wear mini skirts. they are just dolls okay? no need to argue if they wear short mini skirts. anyway about this doll i am totally adore her. she is very pretty and very rockstar material (i don't know how 2 spell.i don't care about her having tatoos. lot of celeb got tatoos and she's a rockstar material.

" fly through spanish is some of the best software for the fly pen available. you can write a word in english and hear the spanish translation or write a spanish word and hear the english translation. the translator will also spell out translations for you (my only complaint is that the translations are spelled a bit too quickly especially if you're trying to write them down). the cartridge even comes with some games to help you learn spanish words. fly through spanish also comes with a booklet that has verb conjugation charts and ideas for games you can play. i was very impressed with the verb charts. they actually includes all the tenses and a chart of irregular verbs. fly through spanish is a great tool for learning and practicing spanish words. please keep in mind that this software will not teach you spanish but it is a wondeful and downright fun addition to a class or self-study program. i hope that leapfrog releases more languages especially french ",positive
" any game that gets my husband dressed up in a tiara and earrings while playing a board game with his girls is a great game! it's simple to play for anyone over age 3 (unless the child is orally fixated- there are smaller pieces so use your better judgment!) is fast enough to hold a child's (and adult's!) interest and let's everyone relax and not worry about rules- we really enjoy it and are wearing it out pretty quickly. it has been a great gift for other friends as well as it's not too well-known.

" santa claus brought this game for my daughter for christmas and she loves it! it doesn't take terribly long to play so it's a great game to hold the attention of a nearly 5-year-old. we've even talked dad and big brother into playing and there's a (playful) fight over who has the crown. the perfect gift for little girls. thank you santa ",positive
" my daughter is almost 3 and she loves her trampoline. she is very curious about how santa got it down the chimney though! not easy to put together but could be if directions were clearer. great product great price ",positive
" this is a well engineered product; i cannot call it a toy because it is much much more than that. after building just one of the sample setups i was able to put down the manual and start creatively designing and building my own. my daughter (3.5 years old) loves it. she really likes placing a marble on the run when i tell her its time to test it and i let her identify the error. the only marbles that have fallen off the track are due to construction errors by myself. after 1 day (and several of our own setups) we already find ourselves wanting more pieces. i suggest buying the largest set from the get go if you have an engineering type mind or just enjoy puzzles. nice feature to note : the coloring of the blocks is logical; each color has its own unique function(s).

" the quality and workmanship of this item was very good. i gave it to my grandson for x-mas. it was almost identical to the one his father had at his age. thanks for a quality product ",positive
" my toddler (22 months) loves this doll. there's something about his wide open mouth and little round nose that enchants her. she actually threw over elmo for ernie. i never thought i'd see the day. ernie is carried all around with her and the nose gets lots of kisses. great toy for girl or boy fan of sesame street ",positive
" i played this when i was young so i thought my 2 1/2 year old would enjoy it too. she got to pick which color she wanted to be and we counted how many ants to get into the pants. it took a little practice but she got plenty of ants in and had soooo much fun. we really had a great time ",positive
" after i read the reviews on this toy i wanted to cancel my order. thankfully i didn't because my kids love it. i have two boys 5 & 9 and they love bowling with this toy. my kids have played with it since we got it in feburary. in the reviews people said the toy broke soon after playing with it. my kids play with it all the time and we have not had any problems. everything still works great; the pins the sound and the ball return. ",positive
" i am quite fond of this character. sure he is a horribly evil dictator who wouldn't give a second thought to breaking you in half if you looked at him wrong but you have to understand where he's coming from. as the hulk bruce banner focused his rage against evil to help humanity. then there is a world-wide nuclear holocaust the world is a wasteland and as the hulk bruce sucks up a lot of the radiation. fusing his mind to the hulk's i think he has a right to be a little screwed up and angry. this highly possible figure comes with a spiky crown thing and the appropriate comic book. he may not make a great center piece but the figure is good looking none-the-less ",positive
" this is the only figure in the apocalypse series that dose not have a variant figure. kinda makes you wish it were the sentinel series and if you can find them most of them are variants that you might actually want. i was fortunate enough to hit wal-mart at a time when the shelves must have been just stocked because the racks were full and all five variants were right there in front. needless to say i bought all 5. but maestro as far as i know has had one appearance in the entire marvel universe so what variant is even possible. despite some protests that this is another hulk figure this is not some namby pamby rehashed hulk with screaming action fist pounding and slightly purplier pants that we've seen a dozen times before but an almost entirely all new figure. one reviewer said the body was based on the smart hulk figure but i wasn't lucky enough to snag one so i don't have a basis of comparrison. however he is well muscled warty and weathered alot like he looks in the included issue of captain marvel. and if your wondering just what exactly to do with him fear not captain marvel is to be released in series xv near the end of this year. then he can go a few rounds with your maestro. now ml where's our legends 2099 spidey? (he was also in that cm comic.) he is a good figure could be a little bigger like more on scale with juggernaut from series vi but he does come with the apocalypse piece whcich is a great figure in and of itself ",positive
" the maestro the evil future intelligent world conquering version of the hulk comes with one arm and arm tube of the mighty apocalypse. apocalypse being the kick butt 14 giant figure you can build if you buy the six figures in this series. maestro hulk has great paint and body sculpt with tons of detail and his muscles are so huge it looks like his skin may burst. his beard is scuplted and painted well and he comes with his crazy pointy hat that fits well on his bald head. he is a touch shorter than i'd like and this plus the swelled size of his arms and hands and his funny clothes do make him look dwarf like but once you get used to it it grows on you. overall a really cool figure and someone to take on the first appearance grey hulk from the galactus series. talk about alpha and omega ",positive
" we looked everywhere for this float after borrowing one while swimming at the lake with our 11 month old. the nice thing about it is that it provides a safe and comfortable ride while allowing the child to be right in the water and splash around. we can swim right alongside and spin him around or swim underneath to come and suprise him from the other side. we don't have to worry much about the water being too deep because the float is so stable. i would say the only drawback is that while it inflates fairly easily squeezing all the air out and collapsing the float can take a few tries. i would recommend this product to anyone with an older baby who wants to take their child for a float in calm water ",positive
" my one-year-old son had a great time playing with these blocks ... he loved the colors and shapes. he really enjoyed knocking down my block creations. we had such a good time playing with the blocks that i decided to go on-line to buy him some. i was shocked at the price. i cannot believe [what] these blocks cost ... for thirty-two foam blocks?!?!?!?! forget it. it's too bad that these blocks are cost restrictive; they're great fun but not worth the price ",positive

" this is one of the most fun games i've every played. there are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question. i find the questions (and answers) are quite educational too i've learned a lot from these questions. a group of family members played at christmas (6 of us) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question (a bluff). we even let our 5 year old nephew play and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs. try it it is loads of fun. i recommend a group of at least 4 though ",positive
" i was so glad when my little sister got this game for her birthday! unfortunaty our version wasn't like the version i had when i was young. for some reason the people stand didn't open or close very well. so while for some you could smack down others you had to jiggle and wiggle to get to lay flat. not only that but when we would start a new game you're soppose to be able to just flip the board over and all the stands would flip out. well for the red board they didn't flip so well in fact only a few would flip up with out help. that could have been my fault when i put the pieces together. the game was still fun althought it was hard teaching my six year old sister not to exclaim out loud that she's glad of who she got because she likes her hat. although i didn't have a problem with her picking her person instead of doing it randomly(like you're soppose too) i still love this game and forever will. ",positive

" i recently bought these 4 little dora dolls for my 4 yr old's birthday. she really loves them. she plays with them all the time. it is a nice collection to her dora stash! ",positive
" this was my 3rd bionicle and my 1st rahkshi. so far all i need for the green bionicles is lewa the toa nuva of air it is sold out every where. well any way each rahkshi has a staff with speacial powers rahkshi lerahk's staff can poison anything at touch ",positive
" i've been consistently impressed by the bionicle toys from lego and the rahkshi are no exception. wish i was young enough to actually play with this stuff. sigh. anyway rahkshi take the bionicle can-sold figures to new a new level of articulation. in total joints are found at the neck shoulder wrist hip knee and ankle and the crank on the back swivels the entire arm assembly from side to side so you can whack things with the staff-like weapon each of the rahkshi weilds. then there's the opening case on the back so you can flip spooky little rubber leech/slug things through the air. each one of these things appears to come with a miniature cd full of quicktime promotional stuff for the toys game web site etc. the voice is a bit melodramatic but it's still kind of neat. i like the 360-degree rotating model of the toy you just bought...sort of redundant since you can look at the one in real life but nifty all the same. one thing that mildly disappointed me is that the rahkshi's weapon isn't really an independanly existing object - which is to say that the bar held between the hands is only attached to the hands not the heads of the weapon. this isn't a really big deal except that it means you can't have the figure hold the weapon in only one hand. this could be rectified with 2 small technic pieces of course but it does mean you'd have to add extra bits to the set from somewhere else. overall a very cool build-it-yourself action figure that could either be set to stand looming on your monitor at work or actually played with. educational value is limited to following instructions and demonstration of structural principles as in any lego set. durability seems good so far - lego is pretty sturdy stuff ",positive
" two grandsons (4 years and 6 years)have truly enjoyed this cartridge. recommend it highly! ",positive
" my niece is about to be two and she loves school buses so i thought this would be worth a try. she loved it... hours of fun and if you are patient you could fold it back up and put it back in the box ",positive
" bought for 2 year old twins... it held up with about 5 kids in it and even an adult at the birthday party. the only thing that doesn't appear to be the greatest is the detachable steering wheel because with my kids it would end up missing in no time. definitely a great gift. ",positive
" this is the greatest thing i was worried because some of the reviews said it was not made good and it was easily torn. not only has it lived up to my 3 year old but we set it up outside and all the kids come and play it has not torn. it sparks great imagination. all her friends go to school now this allows her to pretend with them that she is going also. and best of all we can store it anywhere when we are done she has even learned to close it up and put it away. i highly recommend this bus to all!! ",positive
" i got this game for my then nearly 4-year-old daughter and a year later she still enjoys playing it. the game is very simple and does not require reading. all the parts and pieces are high quality. it's a good opportunity to work with numbers and measuring plus the game goes fast so you can play it quickly if needed or multiple rounds if you have the time/inclination. the object is to create the tallest character by mixing/matching 5 parts (feet legs body head and hat). the character pieces are brightly colored and fun and include: ballerina doctor fireman/woman policeman/woman cowboy/cowgirl and a clown. a roll of the die determines which part you select. the die has both pictures and words--except for the wild side which is printed in red. after the characters are assembled each player measures with the included ruler (you can choose centimeters or inches) to see whose character is the tallest. it's a sliding ruler with a base so the kids can actually fit their character inside and line up the top with the corresponding number on the ruler. i wouldn't recommend this game for kids beyond 5--it may be a little too simple. but for 3/4/5's it's a great game ",positive
" i first became aware of eat it through an article in the washington post. my family enjoyed playing the game so much that we invited the creators of eat it to appear at an event in our local community. it is a game that truly the whole family can have fun playing together. my seven year old daughter emma was thrilled to learn that one of the questions asked in the game was about a candy bar that was called fat emma and was hoping that it was still being sold(it isn't). great game ",positive
" it's a nice pool..a pain in the ass to blow up without a pump but oh well. lol it's a good tuy over all to have and holds a lot of water. it's just hard to dump it all out once you're finished..that drain hole should be on the side and not on the bottom of the pool ",positive
" i think that this was a great item - something unique from what i can usually find around here. my daughter loved it. like any other polly items lots of little pieces but overall very nice. i was a bit miffed when i found out that the photo booth really doesn't take photos. i guess i should have thought about that a bit more. overall it's just fine ",positive
" i love the luke fx lightsaber more than any other one because it is made nicely it is light and it has a good glow in the dark that makes it look real. i would not even dream of fighting with it i would think it would break in a few days of fighting. there is not much to say except it is the best fx next to the darth vader and it looks cool in the dark. it is so bright it lights up a whole room when the lights are off ",positive

" santa brought this for my 5 year old daughter for christmas and she loves it. she takes it in the car with her with her baby doll and belts it in with the seat belt. one of the things i love about it is it isn't too heavy for her to carry. she can carry it with her baby doll in it without any trouble. it is also very sturdy. she has even sat in it herself and it didn't break. i would recommend this doll carrier. it is great for little people who enjoy pretending to be mommy and daddy ",positive
" you know the family games that you regret buying especially when you see your child coming at you with it on a rainy day saying will you play this with me? well rat-a-tat-cat is not one of these. it's simple enough to learn but there is enough challenge in it to keep even an adult guessing. rat-a-tat-cat was a gift to our family but when my youngest daughter (age 4 or 5 at the time) got the hang of it it became her favourite and here's why: 1)though she was just learning numbers she could understand the game 2)the guessing part of the game put her on equal par with adults to her delight. 3)even for a busy adult it's easy enough to sit down and play this game and actually can be relaxing. 4) if a guest came over my daughter was able to explain the game rules to the guest and soon she'd have even teenage guys sitting cross-legged on the floor trying to get rid of the rats. good ice-breaker. simply put rats are bad cats are good. high points ~ you don't want them. the higher the number on the card the more rat-power in the drawing. zero is the best with rats gone and a cat installed as a happy statue of liberty. the drawings are whimsical & clever. the reason it's a success as a game for all ages is because though it appears simple there is the element of not knowing what your cards are and even if you peek (with permission) opponents can take your best away from you. so if you don't mind losing to a kid and making that kid's day as well as having a laugh go ahead and get this game. my daughter is older now and we still play it. she's also learned to be a good loser :- ",positive

" i just found this car at toysrus for $3.49; plus others in this series. i came online to amazon to see if i could find characters not available at the store and i was blown away by these prices--$29.99???? you've got to be kidding me! i bought the toy cars for my five year old son to play with--the only reason i can see toys being priced this high is they must be trying to catch collectors. i'm glad i could find what i did at a local store; i definitely would not pay these high prices... i would have been very happy to buy others in the series from amazon but at these prices i am definitely not going to!

" my daughter received this loom as a gift for her 6th birthday. even though the box says for ages 7 and up and even though she's not the most nimble-fingered kid she has no trouble using this loom with just a little help. the materials seem to be high quality and it comes with a good amount of thick colorful yarn. the loom has been keeping my daughter happily occupied for long periods of time. she enjoys watching me knit but doesn't have the dexterity yet to knit herself so she's thrilled to be able to weave herself scarves and the like ",positive
" when it first came out almost 20 years ago i saw this game at a bookstore and bought it to take on a christmas skiing vacation with my family. unfortunately my mother ended up having emergency gallbladder surgery instead. we didn't have gifts that year but we did made it to colorado and spent hours by the fire laughing until our ribs ached playing this crazy game. it doesn't matter if you can draw it's how fast you can put something down that halfway suggests the word they give you and how ridiculous everyone's scribblings usually look. i've played it with an artist. he couldn't even draw a nose and chin in the 20 seconds he had so his artistic standards took a dramatic tumble. if my spirits need a boost i play this game. buy it. you'll love it ",positive
" this game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it. his little sister who is two also loves this game. this game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues. it is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept. there are no complex rules to learn so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game. as each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match. best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the tv turned off ",positive

" we recently played bonkers at our game club. as we read the instructions we were hoping going bonkers would be fun and it was. bonkers is a game based on asking players questions. the questions are not trivia and knowledge-based questions but instead word-based questions. for instance a question might ask you to come up with words that end in bell. during your turn you have 30 seconds to go bonkers trying to blurt out answers like: barbell; dumbbell; doorbell cowbell etc. your goal would be to find as many answers as possible in order to hit any or all of the four answers provided on the game card. for every answer you hit you win scoring chips. that was just one category of questions called add ons - where you find words that begin or end with a certain word. the other categories are: what the blank - where you find words to complete the blank; rhyme time - where you find as many rhymes as possible in order to match those provided on the game card; and letter perfect - where you would find words which begin or end with certain letters. the game play is interesting because there is some strategy thrown in. at the beginning of the round one player (the card reader) peeks at the question and answers on game card and decides how many scoring chips each answer is worth. so in the example above the card reader might allocate 5 scoring chips to the answer cowbell four chips to barbell three chips to dumbell and two chips to doorbell. this is done by placing the chips on the gameboard under target answer a; b c or d. the object is for the card reader to decide on which answers are hardest and place the most scoring chips on the hardest answer. this is because if the players do not hit some or any of the answers provided on the game card the card reader will win the scoring chips leftover and advance on the board. however if the players hit all or any of the answers on the game card they win the scoring chips for the correct answers provided. i really like the strategy part of the game it adds a good deal of spice. bonkers provided for an entertaining evening. we will play again!

" i love this playpen!! durable plastic can be extended to larger size (or shortened if going someplace that is not as large). only problem is that my baby loves to wander. she is not thrilled when mommy cages her up in order to protect her while i make dinner and cannot watch her as closely as necessary. crib toys can be safely attached on the sides (did that with her aquarium toy which she loves and it soothes her). occasionally plays with music buttons and phone but nothing else seems to interest her. i just put her other toys in for her to play with ",positive

" we use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1- and 2-year old children. it's intended for children a little older and i can see why as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps. however my 2-year-old can use it by herself and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys. i had to hold it in place for my 1-year-old but when doing so it also allowed him to color. i would recommend it especially for children 3 and up.

" i have read other reviews here that this table is too high for 2 and 3 year olds. maybe so but it is wonderful for 4-5 year olds! those in between stages kids who want to have a small table of their own but need something a bit taller and more sturdy than those made for toddlers. my son (almost 5) and his big sister (7) can both sit together and eat a snack at this table. it is very sturdy! the small drawer is great for crayons or stickers to be put out of the way at snack time. the surface of the table is just the right size for imaginative play with puzzles or action figures. the unique oval shape of the table takes up less room while still providing a good sized table top surface space. my son had outgrown 2 child size table and chair sets by age 4- most are actually buit for toddlers- this table is actually for kids and it has been a big hit at our home. guess who's getting the matching lifestyle kitchen for christmas ",positive
" the only draw back of this toy as others have said is the arms are stiff and make it hard to hug.. other than that this toy is simply adorable the motorized sound of movements are hardly noticable.. and the sounds it makes are truly neat. my daughter got this over a year ago (she is 7 now) and she still loves this bear and we have not had any problems with any broken limbs.

" ever since my son was 10 months old he just had to check out the vacuum whenever it was out. so we decided to get him a toy vacuum for his birthday. since we use a canister vacuum i wanted to get him a canister vacuum as well and this was pretty much the only one out there. he just loves it and since he is under 3 (the recommended age) i took the long gray pole out of the vacuum so its just his size. (the head fits fine straight onto the hose.) he knows how to turn it on & off but mostly likes dragging it around. he also likes taking the two attachments out. and i love how this vacuum has no real suction because then it would not be safe for my little one. the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because he loves this toy so much that he wants to drag it everywhere. and that can be a pain- (to the car in the highchair on the changing table etc.) so i've had to hide it sometimes. :) but i am very happy with this vacuum ",positive

" my 9 year old son loves dragon mountain. he wasn't able to assemble it alone; eventhough he's typically very good at assembling most other toys. it took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it...but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together ",positive
" we are loving this set! very cool dragons a fun environment for characters to explore and fight in. extra fun from several moving features - rasing/lowering cauldron tramcar on sloped tracks erupting mountain top opening dragon mouth flapping dragon wings firing cannon. a little challenging to build but the instructions are fairly clear. assembly took an adult about 3 relaxed hours. a few sections come apart after some play but they are pretty easy to put back together. so far no pieces have broken. most important this is a lot of fun to play with. over the past two days our set has been getting non-stop play from a 9 year old boy and 6 year old girl. a great toy for two kids to play with together and the boy says a single child could also spend hours happily playing by himself. we wouldn't have paid the full retail price for this but at $35 (amazon discounted price) i think this is appropriate value.

" this is a great toy that lets childrens' minds grow. both my 7 and 5 year old love to play with this toy. the magnetic base is so strong that you can build the metal peices ontop of each other to make a big sculpture. i would highly recommend this ",positive
" previous reviews listed the lack of volume control as a negative point. in a panic i ran to check the three i have purchased for christmas gifts 2002. all three have volume controls now! don't let reviews on a previous model keep you from purchasing these products. friends have these and my girls begged for their own. as a home-schooling mom i prefer to buy toys that are both fun and educational - leap frog is my best source ",positive
" the game of memory is a great equalizer because little children are just as apt to remember where they saw the hidden images as older children or adults. this makes it great game for the whole family to play together. the images from the &quot;i spy&quot; book illustrations are bright and creative. they don't match exactly- for instance there might be two images of cats but borrowed from different photographs in the i spy books. so there is a bit more visual variety to spice things up. this is a much more attractive memory game than most and would make an ideal gift for a child or family ",positive
" i just purchased this redesigned at-st from a local retail store. for the basic price of $20 for 244 pieces this set is well worth the price. i purchased the original at-st years ago and this model far surpasses that one in all ways. it's larger much more stable and has a unique pivoting mechanism which rotates the cab. it was very difficult to get the original at-st to stand upright without falling over; the 7657 is extremely stable. the original at-st had chewbacca at the controls which was pretty cool. however not as cool as the at-st driver that has a new helmet and blaster. the only drawback is that his minifig head is flesh colored instead of traditional lego yellow. it took about 20 minutes to put the model together. it wasn't very challenging but interesting to see how the rotating mechanism was put together. i would highly recommend purchasing this set. for the low price of $20 for such a detailed and complete set it's well worth the price. you won't be disappointed ",positive
" i bought this toy because amamzon's price was a great bargin compared to other stores. i would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way. there is a lot more room for more logs. 115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front. i ended up buying additional logs (not lincoln logs) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence ",positive
" i was very happy with the lincoln logs i ordered for my three year old grandson. he has been enjoying them. they seem to be more complicated than they were when my son was his age which was about 35 years ago or close to it. then it was only one small log cabin but this set is a western building. my grandson has still been able to build something that he likes. thank you for making it available ",positive
" i recently bought this read with me dvd system after much hesitation from other reviews. it was on sale at toy r' us for $18 so i decided that i would go ahead and try it. i took the advice of one of the reviewers and waited until my daughter went to bed to program it. to be honest it took me longer to get it out of the package than to program it. the system was programmed in less than 5 minutes and i have a pioneer dvd player that is over 5 years old. the only thing i would suggest besides waiting until you child is asleep is not to lay the dvd control perfectly flat or it will be lower than the eye on the read with me dvd system. my daughter absolutely loved it! the reason i gave it 4 out of 5 is because wish they had a few more dvd available in stores. ",positive
" ok so my son got it for christmas and here it is june and i just hooked it up. it took me all of 5 mintutes not even that to program it. the first try #4 wouldnt take so what i did is i put the toy remote on one thigh and the remote on the other so that there were almost touching and so that the eyes were right on top of each other. and it took straight away. its really fun for my 4 year old my 10 year old got bored. my only suggestion is that there needs to be a bigger choice of games. they are so similar that my 4 year old changes games quite a bit. i am actually having trouble finding games for it now. its great and if they are going to be in front of the tv might as well be learning. he also hase vsmile which is a little bit better if you can afford the 60$ for the game unit and 20$ for the games. (grandma and grandpa got ours for us with games) so it wasnt bad for us. read with me dvd is good though i really enjoy playing it and listening to the stories ",positive
" my children are 7 5 and 20 months and they all love it. the baby is especially fascinated by it and was able to make the top spin by herself after her brothers coached her a bit. the humming sound is much less annoying the many of their battery operated toys with voices and electronic noises ",positive
" my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors i like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen! it has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile. it was a little difficult at first for my son to handle since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast. the colors are pretty cool the faster it spins the more colors come out (primary + yellow/orange colors). i like that it holds his interest. a [...] could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow! ",positive
" this is a perfect game that you can enjoy with the whole family! it is very fun and great for little ones too! i own this game and my family enjoys it very much. this is a great mystery game where you spy to find out each pearson's idenity. i love this game and i think you would too ",positive
" if you love the unpredictable then catch 22 is for you. this game has plenty of social interaction and combines skill with luck in the pursuit of 22 gold tokens. just when i thought i was about to win the game my boyfriend landed on my game piece and stole all of my tokens. boy that did not make me happy at all. the key to this game is to use your blocker cubes wisely. the cubes are used to either block an opponents way or safeguard your path to the money. once you use the cubes you can only retrieve them by landing on a 'collect blocker' square. you can collect any blocker cube placed on the board including your opponent's cubes. i made lots of money selling blocker cubes back to my opponents. we were so addicted to this game that we played it all night long. i highly recommend it but be prepared to either win big or lose your shirt!

" i especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms. my only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen. it has a contrast adjustment but it not very helpful. it also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either. a great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast.

" my 4 year old son got some early christmas money from his grandparents. so we went and bought this toy at target (and paid 30.09 for it) he loves it... his favorite part was that you can take the whole thing apart and put it together different each time. my only concern was that the snow monster needs camera batteries or cell phone batteries??? what are those??

" many people are not time oriented. i have used this both in the classroom and at home. it allows the children a visual clue to how much time has gone past. i tell them they have 30 minutes to complete something. i set green for 20 yellow for 7 and red for 3. i don't have to say anything else. this eliminates waiting time once they realize that at red they need to be picking up and getting ready for the next lesson ",positive
" my three year old takes a rest instead of a nap which means he stays in his room for a quiet time so mommy has some sanity. he can't tell time so he would come out every 5 minutes to see if rest time was over. in order to keep him in there for an hour i purchased this clock so he can see and hear when his time was up. it works perfectly and he isn't anxious about when his time is up. he understood the concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up. i set the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on out. no more is it time yet?. i get my full hour of sanity uninterupted!

" we all love this toy. what i like about it is that it's easy to use even for my almost three yr old it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious it's sturdy (will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard) it looks good not cheap and it's pretty wallet friendly as far as price goes. this has been the big hit this christmas. even more so than tekno puppy ",positive
" my 11 yr old son got these moon shoes at christmas and he plays with them a lot. he has adhd and sensory integrative dysfunction and the bouncing really soothes him and gets him refocused. i don't think he ever expected to bounce very high; he seems to be happy enough with the bounce he gets. when he wants to play with them in the house i send him downstairs to jump around on the concrete floor to save wear and tear on my hardwoods. the downside for us has been that the bands have started snapping very frequently. at the rate he's going he'll run out of bands long before he outgrows wanting to play with the toy. so if anyone hears of a way to get more bands please speak up ",positive
" my 8-year old wanted a pirate ship for christmas which was a dilemma because all i could find were ships for toddlers or lego-related ships. this one is fully assembled (phew!) and when he opened the box he jumped for joy. the 4 action figures have the sinister look an 8-yr old could appreciate. the cannon really shoots and the hoist loads and unloads treasures. my son found enough small removable parts on the ship (a parrot tools anchor lamps) to keep him occupied for hours. the whole ship is hard or molded plastic including the sails. i'm fairly confident it will hold up in many future battles. i'm very happy with this ship but i wouldn't recommend it to a toddler or a child who looses small objects ",positive

" this review is not about the toy but about the service you can expect to receive from amazon.com. if you are buying this as a gift only do so if you have months to wait even if the item is listed as available. amazon.com will allow you to pay your money under the guise of sending your items and then days later inform you of a delay in shipping and then a week later inform you the item has just shipped and can take up to an additional 10 days for delivery. despite the site's claims that the item would ship in 24hrs and be delivered in 3-5 days. mind you they're sending it via ups or american home.... honestly there are other retailers out there who are more reliable than amazon.com and i strongly recommend using them - unless you're okay disappointing the little girl in your life. i know i hate having to tell my neice that the gift i promised her still won't be there - even though her birthday has passed by almost a week at this poin ",positive

" our whole family loves this game. i like this version because it includes the history and rules of the game on the inside cover. i also like that you can close the cover and not lose the dice. the construction is a little flimsy and there is not enough felt on the board which makes the dice rolling a little noisy. we added a piece of felt on top of the board and it is much better ",positive
" these days classic game shows aren't really as popular as reality shows like survivor and american idol. however with the surprise summer show game show marathon in cbs many clssics had the opportunity to breathe a glimpse of new life like press your luck match game and card sharks. another classic which was revised let's make a deal. with monty hall's benchmark into pop culture revisted many have wondered whether the classic game of trading will ever come back onto television again. thankfully those who easily own dvd actually don't have to wait for the show to return. they can just trade in the comforts of their own living room. the let's make a deal dvd game recaptures the classic trading that monty hall made popular from the 70's and 80's into a great fun game. in this game monty hall puts traders to the test where you can trade your chances for big nostalgic prizes like classic cars from datsun and cadillac to trips and fur coats from dicker & dicker of beverly hills. on top of that there are classic quick deals to play for extra cash. for example if you have a pair of scissors monty will give you $700. also there are the classic booby prizes zonks!!! although they are fun to receive you get absolutely nothing to show for it. there is also the anticipation of getting the big deal for big bucks. unlike dvd editions of shows like family feud and the price is right the game really delivers a great job from monty and each of the great concepts from the classic game show. the mastering really thrives with classic clips of carol merill and deal's announcer jay stewart on each of the prizes. although i just wish there could've been more games to play i am absolutely impressed with the way let's make a deal was put into a dvd game. if you haven't seen this classic game show monty hall hosted you have to buy this great game. i absolutely recommend this and that is definitely not a zonk! price: b 1/2- dvd mastering: a- fun & enjoyment: b 1/2+ overall: b ",positive

" i bought my seven and ten year old daughters moon shoes for christmas. i had read all the reviews so i immediately instructed the girls to always wear their bicycle helmets when playing with their moon shoes. yes they can be dangerous but with a few precautions i think the kids will have more fun be safer and the parents will have peace of mind. 1. don't let the kids start jumping right away hold their hand or have them put their hand on your shoulder as they practice walking in them. 2. once they've achieved the ability to balance have them practice bouncing in place just a little bit. this will help them learn to balance as they move and learn how the moon shoes respond to the way they move. 3. set ground rules no bouncing when there is a lot of debris around no bouncing while holding objects always wear helmet no bouncing near each other and if you feel or hear any of the rubber bands break while bouncing sit down immediately and take off the shoes. my kids spent the first half hour/45 minutes getting use to their moon shoes. they now can bounce around with stability and confidence ",positive

" this was a hit for both of our kids. they had so much fun making their very own unique soccer ball. we have already used it for our indoor soccer league and it was a hit!! for all you soccer moms and dads this is a wonderful gift for your child. ",positive
" i thought this would be a great gift for my child since she is an avid soccer player and very creative. the markers provided were not any different than ones that we use for crafts. i hope that her design will stay on the ball after playing with it ",positive
" great!!! it is the perfect place to store all those wooden puzzles we all have for our toddlers! the puzzles slide right in on the small metal rods...very easy to remove puzzles! i also like the fact that is made of a lovely natural wood! we have this in our living room and it is quite attractive ",positive
" my son got this game as a gift. i brought it into my junior high classroom to use on a game day. the kids love this game and request it over and over. many other teachers have asked to borrow it for their classes. it is a great vocabulary builder. i also made my own cards with letters of the alphabet on them. i use these when we are studying parts of speech -- they have to come up with a noun (adjective verb etc) that begins with that letter. this is a great game and a good way to make a rather dull subject more interesting ",positive
" my 3 3/4 yr old got these for christmas and he loves them. plays with them almost every day. we bought both dinosaur kits and they are fun to combine together. my son loves to not only put together the proper dinosaurs but make up his own creatures as well. a fun way for dinosaur loving kids to engage in some creative think outside the box play ",positive
" we played this game with 3 couples and all of us enjoyed in very much we laughed the whole time it was a very enjoyed game for all ",positive
" the little mermaid pop-up castle was sold out everywhere this past holiday season selling at $34.99. i found it on amazon for $26.47 and free shipping! my daugher 3 yrs old just loves it. the accessories are very tiny like the tea pot and tea cups. tiny like your pinky fingernail. we all love it! easy to put together but i think it folds up i don't know how though ",positive
" pefect addition to any little mermaid collection. very durable plastic not too many little pieces. clothes for dolls could be easier to take on/off ",positive
" apparently she has loaded this stroller down with dolls purses etc and has not let it out of her sight since it was delivered (on time incidentially!) ",positive
" we bought this pool toy for our daughter and she was thrilled!!! but after being on this toy one time we now call him the bucking bull. good luck staying on the silly thing. now my child sits and hangs on to the handles and we pull her around the pool on it. my husband and i cannot stay on this thing either. every now and then we bail on with sheer determination only to be off in a matter of seconds ",positive
" i have been having such a good time with this marshmellow shooter! i recommend it to anyone. plus you can aim at someone and they can eat what the ammo! thinking of giving these to me employees as christmas gifts! ",positive
" this item is sooooo cute! garfield is dressed in his jammies and is clutching pookie in his left arm. we highly recommend ty goodnight garfield especially if you are a garfield fan ",positive
" the remote on this car has nice big buttons that are easy for my two year old to use. one button makes the car go forward and one turns it around. the third just makes reving engine & squealing tire sounds. not very realistic but convincing enough for a toddler. this car has been tossed around and dropped yet still looks and works great. it is a very durable toy that is simple to use. it is a great first remote control car. ",positive
" this doll is absolutely breathtaking. i bought her for my gift closet but i think i'll keep her for myself! the price was only $5.29 during the special toys r us sale plus free shipping. couldn't ask for a better deal or a prettier collectible doll ",positive
" excellent! my 2 yrs. old grandson is loving it. i purchased a storage case for his melissa & doug puzzles and it helps keep them organized and neat. much appreciated by mom & dad ",positive
" we learned about these blocks years ago when my now 13 year old was in pre-school. i was amazed at how these seemingly simple pieces of wood so totally enraptured these little kids! kapla are 'blocks' that are all exactly the same size. at first glance they seem boring. but once you start playing with them they are so much more. they can be made into all kinds of structures and can even be raised higher than one can reach without falling!! when our 'surprise blessing' turned 2 i pulled them out for him. he enjoyed them (though at 3 he likes them much more) but what surprised me is that my older two (15 and 13) love playing with them as well!! in fact we all do!! i know it seems like a lot of money to spend on these but they are more than worth it! ",positive
" my daughter thinks these are the most adorable fairies. they adorn every possible accessory she and her friends can attach them to. you never know who will have which charms as they are always swapping them. i would say that you get an amazing bang for your buck with these. they are the in thing right now with her 4th grade friends ",positive
" this thing is great. anything you can put on top of it to hold it down will stage it up to go off. it will blow up and not hurt anyone but scare them...funny funny funny!!!! you can use fairly light objects you can use trip cords and you can use trip cord like devices too and probably much more that i have never thought of... good luck good fun and good hunting! sam kochel... p.s. hope this was a helpful review ",positive
" i bought this for my grandson for christmas he was 8 months old. this has been the best learning toy for him along with entertainment. he has learned how the shapes work and took this on soon. it has also helped him in walking. it is entertaining for me to watch him play with this toy he has to push the button and play the music before he pushes it. i would actually buy one more for him to have at home with mom and dad. this is well worth the money ",positive
" awesome music and interaction... fun storage compartment under seat and blocks that fit into the sides and play wonderful songs. gets the kiddo very involved. transitions well from indoor toy to riding outside ",positive
" we love this game. it seems to be the most fun with 5 or 6 people although my husband and i also enjoyed the 2-person version. we do not usually use the board. we just use a scorepad to keep track of points. once you catch on to the game it's not too hard to come up with answers. highly recommended ",positive
" legos duplos ello.. they don't hold a candle to the kid knex in the series. unbelieveable how much our 6 year old daughter plays with these and our 3 yo son too. these have a good feel for kids too. bright. easy to use. we have all in set now. bring on some more ",positive
" i received this for my 3 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it. the price is great right now especially with free shipping. she loves to dress the doll and use all the accessories. more than worth the low price...i'm going to stock up on a few more for misc. gifts. the package is large and comes with a lot of accessories ",positive
" my son is a very active 2 yr old and very hard on toys and these are great. thick plastic construction. easy enough for him to hook them up himself. we have 2 different kinds and they are both super ",positive
" unavailable for some time the sky high suspension bridge is back. once you have the ramps to get the track up there it really stands out as a part of the railroad. assembly was required but routine; the directions were quite adequate. there are no stickers to wiggle into place ",positive
" my niece couldn't put this down after she opened it. she had lots of fun doing tricks for her relatives at christmas. the components of the set are very good quality. i patted myself on the back for discovering this winner gift ",positive
" i've had this high chair for a year now and i love it. my daughter plays with it every day and it's worn great. it still looks as good as the day we put it together. i love that it's wood rather than cheap plastic and it's a pretty white with pink gingham which i think is adorable. the material has held up great and still looks perfect. the wood is sturdy with no cracks. it fits all my daughter's dolls including her large cabbage patch doll. if i were going to change anything i'd like a little bar in the front of the seat that would prevent the babies from slipping through (like real high chairs). for the most part her babies stay put but sometimes they slip down and out. it's not a big problem though. our friends bought the same one a year ago for their daughter and feel the same way about it. we love the badger basket product line! i highly recommend this product ",positive
" another nice product from playdough. worth the ten bucks or so.. we just bought this from amazon. this would make a cute birthday present for a young child say 2 to 8? hard to give an age as i myself like to sit with my son and play! enough play dough for the price and the bucket is really handy for storage. i would buy this again as a gift ",positive
" i bought my harvey toy a while ago and i was quite pleased. it's actually very durable like everyone else has said. the crane doesn't break off no matter how often you play with it or how hard you may accidentaly step on it. i think the only way to break it off is via steam roller. anyway highly recommended for any thomas collector ",positive
" this is an attractive toy for infants and toddlers. the music and lights are nice. ",positive
" this is the best of the leappad books i have seen. my four-year old has spent hours on it. it's very interactive and covers a lot of ground for that age. highly recommended ",positive
" fun for kids age 4 -40. bought it as a gag for my college age son... he loved it for pranks but also let young nieces and nephews play with it. kept them laughing for a long time. ",positive
" being the first ravensburger puzzle i have ever owned it is without a doubt the best quality and the best detailed puzzle i have ever worked with. the quality of the product is shown throughout from the sturdy container practically sediment free packaging the exact cuttings of the each puzzle piece (not a single one was still attached to another puzzle piece and there were only one or two frayed cut spots in the whole set) and the high quality graphic printing. the puzzle itself is made difficult primarily by the use of similar colors throughout. the puzzle pieces are otherwise the standard cut type. the resulting artwork is something that we've decided to actually frame and hang in my office which we have never done over the years (puzzles can be very calming to work on after a long week of long and stressful work hours - especially when working on them with others). the puzzle cuts are so well done that it is not entirely easy for someone to tell that it is a puzzle from general glancing unless they get up close (within 2 feet) and look at the detail. i will definitely buy more ravensburger puzzles and hope that they come out with even more puzzles of this type (old world maps) and same quality ",positive
" an excellent project for your child's school report. we purchased the velociraptor kit for our 8 year old daughter not knowing what to expect. after opening the package my wife came up with the clever idea of pouring melted chocolate chips into the dinosaur molds instead of using the plaster mix that comes with the kit. we experimented with white chocolate chips and created realistic looking dinosaur bones! we buried these edible bones in ground up oreo cookies. what a thrill to see our daughter's 2nd grade class excavate these delectible prehistoric fossils! we can't wait to purchase other kits in the eyewitness series ",positive
" when the toa and all the first bionicles came out it was very simple and straigthforward. bad guys were different from the toa and everyone knew they were bad. now with the pirahka we have villians claiming to be toa! and the matoran believe them! one of the things i really love about zaktan is his weapon. it looks really cool and can change. also the little ball launcher (i forget what it's called) is a lot of fun (i shot my brother with it x3) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome! though the rubber part is sligthy annoying it doesn't really get in the way ",positive
" as a brilliant but ruthless leader of the piraka zaktan thinks that working together is the way to find the ultimate treasure the mask of life! all the piraka have two tools. yes 2. each one has a zamor spheres which are small marbles that each one can shoot but in real life they would be the size of basketballs. zaktan's three-pronged blade is capable of cutting through metal. nothing will get in his way or it will be severely punished................ ",positive
" i bought the little tikes adjust and jam basketball set for my grandson's 4th birthday. it is perfect for his age group. the height can be raised or lowered and comes with 2 small size basketballs. he loves it ",positive
" i think this toy is just too cute. it is a bit pricey though. i would not suggest you purchase this toy for a young toddler...maybe a 2 1/2 to 3 year old. my daughter likes throwing it on the ground and screaming with delight (she is one and a half). she really likes it and carries it around the house. she is a little too young to respect it properly and i fear it may not last long. it is really cute if you have real stainless steal appliances in your home. i bought this because my daughter has taken a keen interest in my microwave and i have trouble keeping her away from it. this toy has solved that problem. one minus is that it came with no instructions on how to get the table to rotate. you have to play with the buttons a little and then you will see how it operates. my daughter can not systematically make the turn table rotate...for her it happens randomly. she enjoys opening the doors pushing the buttons seeing the light come on and hiding her real dinner in there (so parents beware!). someone suggested it is a tiny unit...and so it is but all the other toy microwaves i looked at were very similar in size ",positive
" i bought this doll w/ brunette hair for my 4 year old. it's so soft and realistic looking floppy like a real newborn perfect weight for little ones to cradle. i'd been looking for a 'baby' doll w/ long hair - some of the other co's make them too heavy not conducive for real play. this doll is also washable a big plus. the hair is soft and very brushable the face is sweet and the eyes open and close properly. a little pricier than your average doll but you can see the difference in the skin texture and facial features. overall a very nice doll high quality hopefully will be played w/ for many years. ",positive
" this toy is fantastic. although i have the english speaking toy it still has a similar sounding italian accent to the toy. if you enjoyed the films i highly recommend these toys!!! is it possible to buy an italian speaking luigi ",positive
" i bought this item for my husband for xmas and he loved it but once they were all put together they would fall apart fairly easy but other then that they are great i highly recomend this especialy for a husband or son ",positive
" i bought this for a present for my 2 yr old daughter and she likes it and can turn the handle ",positive
" my 3 yr old grandson loves this. he can manage it ok. good gift ",positive
" satisfied with the overall quality of the product. also with the purchase process ",positive
" my son loves this instrument but i think he likes another saxophone that plays tunes when you press buttons better. this one relies on the child to blow and press the keys like a real instrument but doesn't sound like a saxophone ",positive
" we saw this online and really wanted it but decided to wait because of the reviews. well today we went to an outlet store that sells new stuff at huge discount prices and it was only 10.00 my son has already ridden the heck out of it with no problems and he loves it. we havent had to replace a fuse and it just the right size for my 1 and a half year old. its a really great little bike but for the workmanship of it i definitly wouldnt pay 50 dollars for it maybe 30-35 most. we just got blessed with a really great deal:) so if ya want this for your kids its great for the smaller rider and just the right speed for him to control. hope this helps someone: ",positive
" my family of seven kids four daughters/sons-in-law have owned this game for 2 years. we love playing it and it is one of the few games that everyone enjoys. it is one of our favorite games and that is saying a lot since we own dozens of games. our youngest was 12 when we bought the game and she often wins ",positive
" i've been thrilled with the car so far. super fast and super cheap at this price. it could be a little more responsive when turning but otherwise great. lasted about 25mins with long fast runs using a generic 9.6v pack by newbright. as other person said works better on packed surfaces vs loose dirt and grass. i bought it to bring back memories of my old tyco turbo hopper from childhood...and it did a great job at that. ",positive
" my son likes this item. the cars also fit his train set from imaginarium. the only thing i didn't like about putting this together was the elevator. very tight fit and doesn't like to go up or down easily. but everyone likes playing with it from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds ",positive
" we purchased a starter piece set for my girl when she was 3 years old. she absolutely loved it because it was easy to use and build. she had a hard time with the legos type blocks because it was more frustrating for her to pull them apart. we then expanded to this 35 piece and she is able to be even more creative. it is an excellent lerning toy. not as simple as it seems ",positive
" this doll rocks! i love her hair it's a dark reddish color and it's curled into seperate locks. and her dress is gorgeous! it's a powder pink color with long sleeves and at the hands it has a big ball of white feathers. the necklece she has is very pretty and so is her crown. shes quite durable and would make a great addition to any collection or toy chest ",positive
" my daughter is one and a half and she's had these blocks for about a year now but only now is she really playing with them and identifying the little pictures. some pictures are a little obscure but all the basic animals and objects seem to be covered. i'm very pleased with how smooth the blocks are and how well they are holding up. i feel they will really help my daughter to learn her letters both in upper and lower case. my only problem is with the tray. it only holds the blocks if you keep it completely flat (as if a toddler can transport anything while keeping it level). i also don't like its sharp edges. my daughter went through a phase where she liked dumping the blocks out and then waving the tray around. now the tray is stored out of reach and the blocks are stored in a small plastic bin ",positive
" my 6 year-old daughter got this for christmas and spent more than an hour coloring the pieces. the ink dries quickly and seems to stick pretty well. we have rinsed the tea set a couple of times and never noticed ink washing away. ",positive
" the wooden corral is so simple it encourages hours of imaginative play. it is just the right size for my child's horses to play in and can be easily set up anywhere. yet it is very compact when folded for storage. ",positive
" i give puppytunes as a gift to all my friends that have a new baby. puppytunes is always their (the baby's) favorite toy! : ",positive
" murdoch is a mighty engine with ten drive wheels. he was brought to the island to help with the heavy workload and pull freight on the main line. as shy as he is strong murdoch can often be found seeking peace and quiet. this wooden train is a 2 piece set joined with magnets. my son loves playing with this mustard-yellow engine on his wooden tracks. very sturdy construction and a great addition to the thomas line ",positive
" this is like a real fish the the tub. our little one loves it ",positive
" i got this puppy first on accident trying to get a love and licks puppy. this puppy far outshines love and licks. it actually works without much effort. nose gets magically cold and it wags its tail without much effort. great first puppy toy for a child ",positive
" this action figure is sitting on my desk at home. he's my little computer buddy. it's really not bad at all although the plastic hair doesn't allow his head to move very much. when i'm writing and i get to a point where i need to back off a bit i pick him up and change the pose or threaten my daughter with the masamune or she and i set him up for a couple of humourous pics. it's great. all hail sephi!! (and you can just hear it why the heck are you calling me that? well why not? it's weird and it's not right! but sephi....) hahahaha. can't wait to get cloud too. then things in my house will be interesting ",positive
" the shout about line of dvd games are a great way of getting people together. we play teams (at least 3-5 people on each) and it is always a noisy and fun crowd. ",positive
" this is a fabulous little brio bridge. my kids (6 3 & 2 yrs) all love this as part of their train track. it is a sturdy piece which gets used daily. my kids love that they can drive the train onto the bridge and then push the button that collapses the bridge and have the train (mostly this is diesel 10) fall down. it's a reenactment of the viaduct scene from thomas and the magic railroad movie ",positive
" strawberry shortcake is a princess!!!!! and she is being pulled in a carriage by her prince who is on a horse. they are both sooooo cute!!!!!!! this is one of the cutest ss dolls i have ever seen! this is a definite must-have for me and for all ss doll lovers! buy her now!!!!!!! 5 very big very bright & bold stars!!!!!! this is the best!!!!!!!!

" i probably play over a hundred games of solitaire a night. i have a hard time sleeping but this game after playing as many as i do makes me go to sleep. i haven't read a book in over two months which to me is remarkable because i have read at night ever since junior high. i am now 62 and playing solitaire. thank goodness for it ",positive
" this is a great puppet theater sound stage restaurant play house etc... my daughter was 4 when she received this from santa. he only wished he had found it sooner! my daughter continues to love it and will now be sharing it with her younger sister. many hours of pretend have been spent inside and outside this theater. we especially love it because it is large enough inside for two or more children. all the others we researched were too small for our needs. the colors are so vibrant and fun we get tons of compliments from all our company. all the kids gravitate towards it ",positive
" i love this puzzle! it is fun and challenging. i believe that it is a good puzle for anyone who wants a challenge. however i find that there is one problem with it. there are no dimensions to tell you how big the puzzle is after you put it togrther!!! i would appreciate it if dimensions were added to the box. i am sure that anyone else who purchases this puzzle would appreciate it to so that they know if they are going to have to purchase a puzzle mat as well if they order this puzzle. if you like puzzles that are not your everyday puzzle i would recommend that you purchase this puzzle because it would make a worthy addition to any puzzle collection ",positive
" i love this doll i only saw her in the store and when i did i fell in love with her i cant wait to get her! but i do think its a bit pricey but its worth the money ",positive
" i understand the people who install car seats who feel this item isn't needed and distrust its lack of crash testing but my infant car seats are hand-me-downs without latch. my car has latch but does not seem to have the kind of seat belts that stay tight. my car seat doesn't just get a little loose... you can move it 4 or 5 inches side to side if you try. it may be that a car seat tech could train me to do a better job with the locking clip but i can't get it to stop this. and one of the seats was given to me without a locking clip at all. i have no problem tightening the seat belt enough - it just won't stay that way. this product allows me to tighten the car seat enough to meet the one inch spec. nothing else has. so it definitely adds to my baby's safety. finally- to the car seat techs- with the number of these that have been sold it doesn't appear that anyone has come forward to say that it failed in a crash. just because it hasn't been crash-tested does not mean it is unsafe. and there is absolutely nothing wrong with aftermarket goods as a rule tho manufacturers will always tell you otherwise ",positive
" i love bratz especially ice champions! i want vinessa and the big ice rink with maribelthe new girl. i'm searching for the new bratz so if anyone knows any other ones except for rodeo soryadiamondz sharidian this doll and maribel please comment this. i want this girl she's so pretty! i like how her hair is done and the outfit ",positive
" i purchased this item when my daughter was one year old and it was amazing! my daughter was always a good sleeper but when she began teething at around 9-10 months old she began refusing to stay in her crib each night. i was out of ideas and my husband and i had tried just about every method we read about without success. finally i found the tomy star bright light and it was like a miracle worker! the first night i used it my daughter put herself to sleep in her crib by staring at the ceiling. each night her sleeping became better and better. now we only run it once for 10 minutes and she falls asleep. it is a much better approach then allowing your child to cry it out. she actually enjoys going to sleep now and looks forward to watching the light show before she falls asleep. ",positive
" grandchildren just about wore it out putting it together so many times... ",positive
" we bought this puzzle for my then 2 year old as he had mastered the barn puzzle (which is also amazing). there are monkeys tigers butterflies and numerous other jungle animals. i had to look up several of the animals as i was not sure of what they were. this was a good educational experience for both me and my son. this puzzle is durable as are all of the m&d floor puzzles. it has been stepped on and thrown across the room by a highly rambunctions child. i have had this puzzle for over a year and it looks great. i rotate this puzzle with the other melissa and doug floor puzzzles that we have. i recommend any of their floor puzzles as they are great quality and have easy to handle pieces for kids. they are a great opportunity to teach about different subjects and teach new words to children ",positive
" i bought this for my 4 1/2 yr old daughter for xmas and she was extremely impressed along with myself. it's exactly like the real thing just smaller! very durable colorful and fun! it's great to use with the zapf creation dolls that tend to weigh more than a smaller baby doll b/c the car seat is so sturdy. unlike most car seats this doesn't collapse and fold up whenever you actually try to carry it by the handle! it is definately worth the price ",positive
" you might be disappointed if you were expecting the exact same thing as the original 1984 optimus prime toy (or wanted a trailer for the truck) but this is an updated version of the original character as opposed to a remake and is superior in many ways. it is durable detailed well-articulated and fun especially with the truck parts forming weapons for the robot. i'd recommend it for kids and nostalgic adults alike ",positive
" this product is not the best ever created as the roxxi doll that comes with it is not the prettiest of bratz dolls. she has huge black and red streaks in her hair as well as an oddly-shaped head. however one gets used to her and can even find her pretty. the stage itself is a great product but plugging it in to your stereo is more confusing than you might think. this playset comes with a microphone that is different from the regular rock angelz microphone as it is gray and of a different style. also included is a faux-snakeskin chair roxxi a guitar and a few accessories like bottled water and make up compacts. the stage itself is rather nice and i strongly suggest the instrumentz if you buy this. however be warned that it is not the best of bratz products despite its appeal. it's rather nice though. : ",positive
" i love this nativity even though it i think it is pricey. there are no other ones like it. they are fisher price little people so you know they will hold up forever! there aren't any other plastic nativity sets out there. get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable. it is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year. i even take this to church when i teach my 3and4yr old class about jesus birth. they love it ",positive
" my niece was learning about the birth of christ at school when i got her this nativity set. she was so happy and it was so easy for me to continue teaching her about the birth of christ and christmas. thanks - i was very satisfied with this item and so was my niece ",positive
" my 5 and 7 year olds have gotten a lot of use out of this toy. it is a strong microphone and seems to be made very well. they love to pretend to be rock stars! my only complaint about the toy is there is no volume control.... so you only get one level...loud. i would recommend it for any child that likes to sing ",positive
" i don't understand why they are so offensive to people. i am christian and i lvoe all three midnight dance dolls. i think they are more 'phantom of the opera' than 'sadistic satinist'. meygan is my favorite but yasmin is still beautiful. these dolls are gourgeous ",positive

" damn! i just got the yostick and took it to the local gym and streets to demo some new tricks. at first i had some doubts about the durability of it but after some heavy duty urban testing it's still mad tricking. in other words i've been trying pretty hard to break it. for it's price the yostick is incredible fun. in an age of pricey video-games $10.99 is not a high price for something that provides exercise fun and an introduction to the movement and breathing rhythms of martial arts. a value-priced training tool not a toy at all. the movement required by the yostick will help martial arts beginners have fun while learning precise hand-eye controls. the ends are fitted with rubber tips making it a joy to trick directly off the ground. looking forward to collecting other models. enjoy it ",positive

" my friends and i all in college are major movie buffs so when another friend told me about the game i was eager to try it. some parts are tough but with the team setup of the game it seems to even out. favourite rounds were still crazy: a round where scenes are built piece by piece a word association round: 6 clues are provided and the idea is to name the movie and the quotes round of course! the hardest rounds were the matching and the trivia rounds. still we had great fun. its better if the teams are evenly matched then its more fun. the main objection i have is that in the 8 rounds many of the movies are dated and overused. there are great ones though...rain man cast away!! also this game is linear in progression there is no variation in the order of the questions. scoring uses the honour system. there are 3 games each lasting around 45 minutes at the very fastest its the same as the cost of a regular dvd and is much more fun with lots of people. i have bought this for several people and some of my friends have as well. recently i played a game where a 12 year old and an 82 year old were playing so don't worry about the age thing both enjoyed it. really i recommend it ",positive

" i bought this for my son for christmas which at the time he was only 14 months old. the age says from 18 months. the problem is he can't hold the button down to make it go so i have to walk around the train and hold the button for him. we had a playgroup over and there were kids that were over 2 years old and they couldn't hold the button down either. overall my son loves it but its not age appropriate for him. also this toy is cheaper at toys-r-us. i got ours when it was on sale for $[...]. after christmas they had them on sale half off for $[...] ",positive

" as with all the leap frog products this ones a lot of fun. packed full of learning surprises. i have always felt that making learning fun and easy cuts down on the fact that it's 'work'. the birthday surprise is fun and full of rhyming words that make little one want to learn. i have a hard time giving any leapfrog products anything but a 5 star rating because of the quality in all their products. learning last a lifetime so get them started with fun friends from leap frog.

" this case is nice and tough it holds all the accessories for the fp3 player securely. i gave it 4 stars because i think things like fp3 players need a home and it serves that purpose great. it matches with the player and is built to withstand kids. i did take a star off my rating because as it does have a smallish loop to hold it by it should really have a handle. little hands need something easy to hold on to and the little loop does not suffice for any purpose i could see ",positive
" my three children are huge fans of melissa and doug puzzles and with as many as we own we sure needed a way to store them neatly. being an organization freak myself i was in search of the perfect storage case. not only did it need to hold many puzzles but it needed to be made well and look nice too. melissa and doug to the rescue - once again! we purchased the same storage case in natural and it's been a life saver in our toy room - it makes it easy for them to put the puzzles away without them losing pieces anymore. you might find it hard to spend $30 on an empty storage case so i suggest looking for the storage case that comes with six puzzles for $60 instead. more for your money! in our case we own so many puzzles that we didn't need anymore and especially duplicates of what we already have ",positive
" i bought this bed for my two year old because he got too big for his crib. he moves around a lot in his sleep so i wanted a safe first bed for him. he absolutely loves this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was before. the only problem was that the mattress and box spring we bought were too high so we just use the mattress for now. eventually we'll put the box spring back in.

" our 3 children have had hours of fun with this toy during the 2+ years we've had it in our home. true the food is long gone (cardboard boxes - toddlers - no surprise there). we've also needed lash the front piece on with some string (again it's not constructed to be a bumper car but toddlers don't often keep their play inside the box). the simple design means that when they twist it beyond reason it's flexible enough for me to pop it back into alignment. it's small enough to be comfortable for the 2 year old to push(for hours) and close enough to the real thing to remain interesting for a 5-6 year old. it's gender neutral forgiving enough to go down a flight of stairs (repeatedly) without breaking light enough to not squish whatever's at the bottom.... and sometimes they do even use it to play grocery ",positive
" i bought two of these trucks for my twin boys when they were 16 months old. they loved it so much and the bubbles come out the front for added fun. the music and lots of buttons to push a storage under the seat and a fire helmet makes this a fabulous toy. my boys are now 27 months and have not stopped playing with this truck!! its great buy it buy it!

" i just transformed it for the first time into a truck. it was challenging but doable. probably one of the coolest toys ever but i was an 80's child. as someone else mentioned the grill in front does not quite align with the cab windows when it's all set but other than that it's great. tremendous amount of detail (moveable leg vents head mouth individual fingers/thumb poseable light behind matrix datacom interface working shocks on the wheels and accessories). it's quite tall and heavy for a toy- very impressive. if a piece snaps off from forcing it the wrong way it is designed to snap back on. i never got to own a transformer as a teen but my lost childhood is now officially redeemed. this will adorn my office cube as a conversation piece ",positive

" i bought this house for my daughter who will be 3 in 2 month's. i did a lot of research and was torn between the twin town house and this one the loving family sweet sound's house. at first i almost went with the my first doll house by fisher price but was told by a friend she would proberly grow out of that fast and she was right. this house the sweet sound's is a perfect size for her and i know she will get quite a few year's out of it. yes the furniture is impossible to find. after reading the review's i didn't look for it much knowing i would never find it. i ended up buying her the twin town's bathroom and a few pieces from the my first doll house by fisher price. the pieces work perfect together and are chunkier for her and not so many tiny pieces. they work great with the doll's that come with it too. i did also purchase one doll set from twin town house. the house does make some sound's with just the pieces that come with it they are cute and my daughter doesn't know any better that it would make more if we could of found the correct sweet sounds furniture. she's happy with the way it is. i decided against the twin town because i agreed with some reviewers after looking at it that the room's were too tiny. yes you get more room's but my daughter i know would get so frusterated with alway's knocking the furniture over in those tiny room's. this house has big room's. it fold's up easy in half but not so good when it is filled with furniture. we leave it open anyway's so that is not a big deal. it was easy put together but the sticker's took about and hour to put on. also a note make sure and put the battery in before you fill it with furniture i put the battery in last and ended up spilling the furniture everywhere. also i didn't see any one mention the front door. i am not really sure why but it doesn't open from the outside only from the inside. you can open it from the outside but you have to pull it very hard and really aren't supose to open it that way. why not be able to open it both way's??? i guess their thinking is so if you are moving it so the door doesn't swing open but they could of put a little latch on it so you could of closed it shut when you wanted. also i am not sure what room is supose to be the bathroom. i think it is either the bedroom or above that which i thought was the kid's playroom. i ended up putting the bathroom in the right side of the bathroom. all in all i think is is a great doll house and i would recommend it ",positive
" this emperor penguin puppet is a real hit with my 5 year old. we almost never use it as a puppet but rather as a plush toy/pal. this penguin looks round and pregnant but to my kid this penguin is a perfect friend. he has pretty much outgrown all of his plush toys but for some reason this one has a place in his heart and in his imagination ",positive
" i have an infant in-home daycare and needed a quad stoller for my four babies. when i first found these connectors no one could tell me if they would connect two tandem double strollers together. i asked every store in town almost (some didn't even know what they were!). i just decided to buy them and hoped that they would work. so i went out and bought two kolcraft lil' limo strollers not knowing of course if it would work or not. i'm happy to say that they seem to work really well! i did have to buy a second set though so i have five connectors on mine(couldn't find room for the sixth one). just lock the two inner front wheels so they can't turn and you're off! it is a little hard to turn corners(just take them at a wide angle) but otherwise it works great! i ended up spending just under [price] for the total cost of it much less buying an actual quad stroller. i hope this info will be helpful to someone else also. good luck ",positive
" i just got the whole set of geotrax and really think they look great and way cheaper than thomas however the round housecan only hold one train at a time so it derails the train if you have more than one locomotive. they really need to add the reverse as well so they kids and me ( mom ) lol can really make use of all the options. however overall i really love this toy but yes i had to convert my office room into the geotrax room. be ready to do this if not stick to the basic set up. its very hard though since it all is so coo ",positive
" i was very pleased when this toy finally arrived. the blue devil is removable and semi-posable (his arms move). he is the same size as the simpson figures from the playmates line of toys so i feel like he was made with collectors of those figures in mind. the homer donut-eating action doesn't always work correctly--the mouth and donuts aren't correctly synchronized so sometimes the donuts miss his mouth--but that does not detract from the fun ",positive

" i played atmosfear the harbingers on vhs in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay. then i saw this dvd update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down. here's my judgement: 1) the mechanics have been simplified. this has it's pros and cons. it could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components. 2) the gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the dvd update. 3) it is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed. one reviewer seemed to think the game was boring. i'll guess instead that the people he parties with don't have the attention span for board games. too bad for them. atmosfear - the dvd board game get's a b+ from me ",positive
" this is a well thought of game. a game where the players play along with the dvd as the gatemaster gives you commands rewards or punishiments while they are playing the game. players can also watch the rules and the setup instructions on the dvd. six keys of six different types will be laid out on some of the spaces as your goal is to get one of each type and rush to the center before 49 minutes is up. if neither player wins in 49 minutes the gate master has defeated you. in the beginning you write down your fears and reveal them at the end which is always fun. the board has six territories. each character owns a territory which has a set of the same keys. you can pick up a key by landing on the key space having a card telling you to gate master telling you to or winning a duel. a duel is when you land on a battle space and 2 players wager a key for a dice roll to see who gets both. there are two types of cards... time and fate. land on a skull head and get a fate card which allows you to do something in a certain situation. a time card you get if you land on a clock. a time card allows you to do something if you play it in the exact second it tells you to. sometimes the gate master will give you the power to banish someone. when there is reward there is also punisment. if you land on the cursed key you have to pick it up and whenever you have it you cannot win. if you are landed into a black hole you cannot participate until you are freed. also you can lose keys. during the game the gate master says stop! frequently and the players will have to lisen to what he says or be punished. all in all it is one of the best games out there and well worth the money. ",positive
" the 1st version of this game was a fun and exiting game for my family. but we soon got bored of the same video over and over. we could not believe it when we saw a new version of the game out we rushed out to buy it and found this version not the same and not as complicated or as fun as the first they should have just released the first version of the game with new dvd setup it was a waste of money ",positive
" this toy is wonderful for several reasons. for one thing it's really the only shape sorter your child will ever need. it has very basic shape sorting (with cut out holes in the sides and one door that can be opened for any shape block to go in) plus pretty complex shape sorting when you open various locks. the toy also helps teach colors and animals and the locks develop fine motor skills even further. overall this toy is very well made. it's real wood dove tailed together. it could of course fall over but if your child is the 18 months or older that is recommended for this toy he or she probably isn't small enough for it to hurt. the locks on this toy are a little more chintzy. they wobble which makes locking or unlocking some of them more difficult...but you could look at this as just another learning tool. my biggest concern is that the blocks are relatively small; they could squeeze through a toilet paper tube. this means they are a potential choking hazard so you'll want to supervise when your child uses this toy. all that said my 20 month old loves this toy and plays with it more than anything else she has ",positive
" as a mother of 5 this toy has proven to be one of my favorites of all time. my son received it for christmas (at age 2 months) and it has been wonderful. we place it in his bed at naps and at night and he goes to sleep watching and listening to it. when he wakes up it is there for him to play with. as he has grown (he is now 7 months) he has become increasingly more interested in the sounds and textures of the toy and now puts the corners in his mouth which has helped with teething. i have been impressed with the sound quality (it is not annoying like most musical children's toys) and i will be anxious to see if it causes my son to love music on a different level. love this toy!

" my six month old enjoys this. it can keep him occupied for 10-15 minutes at a time and the music is quite pleasant and soft. good toy ",positive
" i bought this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she loves it! the music quality is great and she really enjoys the lights. it has a very sweet face and she smiles and talks to it a lot. i got it on clearance which is good because as cute as it is i don't think it is worth the original price. i would definately recommend it if you can get it on sale ",positive

" it is a very nice product. i bought if for my 1 year old grandbaby to take to nursery with him. i put in pictures of the family so he could look at them with his teachers. my daughter says it very useful and he is adapting to his nursery quicker. ",positive
" this is a super fun toy that my daughter has had now for over a year. if you can find it anywhere i would highly recommend it. it plays pre-programmed songs plus your child can also be her own musician and even record her music for playback. the microphone is nice for aspiring american idols (like my daughter!) and it really is pretty. we did lose the dancing cinderella with prince charming but while we had it is was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played. it also does a pretty light show. i cannot give this toy enough stars as it is a really wonderful toy for 3-6 year old girls ",positive
" i got this yesterday for my daughters (3 & 6 years old) and they like it very much...let's see how long that lasts. the space is kind of cramped but both of them fit in there with a few dolls so i wouldn't complain about that. setting it up was pretty easy and although it has almost no stability (it gets toppled every couple of minutes or so) that doesn't seem to take away the fun from it. however there were a couple of surprises for me: a) the product i got is very different from the picture in the advertisement. it is still shaped like a castle and has the disney princesses and all but it is just different. i am not complaining my girls like it a lot. b) as i said before setting it up was fairly easy (just keep your face away as you take it out of the box for it will spring out on you very fast) but trying to disassemble it and putting it away is a completely different story. for that you have to remove 4 rods (which were not so easy to insert in the first place) and then you have to fold the thing away twisting it in a way that only experienced snake handlers would be expected of being able to do so (i don't care how easy it should be according to the instructions). i tried it for about 20 minutes until i gave up. and if you don't keep the box this thing came in just forget about storing it folded it would be like trying to keep a jack in the box compressed without the box. think about it. so if you don't mind adding this to the permanent decor of your house go for it your girls will probably like it.

" my 2 year old daughter recently recieved this as a present from her grandparents. she loves the disney princesses and was ver excited. i was happy to see how easy it was to put up and take down she plays with it in her room almost everyday and i love the fact that we can take it down before she goes to sleep. overall we are very pleased with this tent although it would be nice if it was a bit bigger so that i could play in there with her ",positive

" we bought my son a couple of starfighters the tri-fighter the at-rt and the wheel bike. he loves the starfighters and likes the at-rt a little. he rarely plays with the wheel bike. i think the starfighters are just simpler sturdier and easier to play with. the wheel bike (and to a smaller extent the at-rt) are more complicated and thus less fun for a 5-year old. we run around having mock dog-fights with the starfighters but poor old general grievous sits in the toy box. overall probably good for older kids who can more expertly manipulate the legs and other stuff but not all that fun for the younger guys ",positive
" these blocks are so great! they've gone through their different stages of growth. they learned to reach for them peek inside grasp them toss them around and now stacking them to make towers. my triplets are 20 mos and have had them for about a year. love them all ",positive
" all of the peek a blocks are fun. although each set has a different 'theme' they are very similar and enjoyable to play with. these blocks are great fun. each block has something interesting inside it. in our house these have been played with by boys and pretty roughly at times. the windows to see inside are still clear and not one of these blocks have broken. so i would say they are sturdy and hold up well to normal play. on the ends of each block is a texture. within each block is something interesting. and many blocks have an activity associated with it- push a button to make a noise twist a knob to make something turn around etc. the one thing i would warn is that these blocks do not stack well particularly in tall towers. so if you are thinking of buying these for tower building i'd consider a different set of blocks. otherwise these are excellent toys. they provide a basis for communication and vocubulary building with your child. they are sturdy and encourage language eye hand coordination and so on. if you enjoy toys that are fairly quiet do more than have a push button to make a noise foster independent creative play and exploration of the world this is an excellent toy. enjoy.

" my daughter has trouble concentrating in school. i got this for her birthday and her grades instantly improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a noticable improvement in all areas of her work. the best thing about it is that i don't have to tell her to use it because she loves it. i told her it's just like having a laptop because she always wanted a computer of her own. this is as close as i'm willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her age plus it's a minute fraction of the price of a personal laptop. for children who don't have a hard time in school this may not be for them but for my daughter it is a whole lot of what i needed to help me help her learn. i just wish i could find an adapter.

" in boggle players compete against one another and a 3-minute hourglass to find word combinations across randomly distibuted letter cubes on a 4x4 grid. the game develops pattern recognition skills and because most possible words are only three or four letters long astute younger players can play adults without too much of s handicap. tactics learned playing boggle translate well into success at scrabble and other word games while the clock management skills help with chess and test taking. boggle is lightweight and makes a good travel game though you might want to bring a zipper-lock sandwich bag to avoid losing the letter cubes. as an added plus the game can be played solitaire with minimal dropoff in entertainment value. if you enjoy boggle you might want to seek out big boggle which uses a 5-by-5 grid (56% more cubes). words and time limit are both longer.

" i received this ty pig as a baby shower gift. my son discovered it when he was 18 months old and it's his dearest companion besides his night-night. piggy must go for car rides eat with him get jammies on and go to the dr. to have his temperature checked. we love piggy because when he's covered with milky cheerios we can just throw him in the washer and dryer. he's good as new in about an hour. who wouldn't love that? it's also a great toy for allergy sufferers because it can be thoroughly cleaned regularly to remove dust mites. we love it and my son loves it. now we ordered a spare piggy so that there is a piggy substitute when piggy is bathing. enjoy your toddler ",positive

" i just bought this doll @ toys r us and i was also able to purchase the hilary duff shopping sisters doll which is supposed to include her sister haylie duff which isn't available yet. i have the two other hilary dolls the first of which was released in 2002 or 2003 and it was a lizzie mcguire doll which doesn't look much like hilary at all. then there was the hilary dolls released by playmates which had a more slight resemblance than the first doll. now mattel has made a doll of hilary duff and it is by far the most visibly accurate doll i've seen. and the clothes and accessories are really cute too. i think a lot of girls would love this doll and possibly older fans too. i'm just waiting for the haylie duff doll to debut early next year and her doll also bears a striking resemblance. the dolls are available @ toys r us kb toys wal-mart all under $20.00.

" this pony has proved (along with the princess promenade) to be one of the most popular of the my little pony's we have bought. it comes with a pink skirt a pink crown and high heel shoes. the most popular item was the dressing table with revolving mirror and after several months it still hasn't broken despite harsh treatemnt. the pony is white with silver strands through the mane and tail. it was very pretty but the rough treatment really does make the mane matted very quickly. also think about getting white pony's very seriously for younger children while the coloured ones can be drawn on with pen and the stains wiped off and at least partly concealed - on white ponys it is impossible to hide. for the younger ones (3 year olds) it is hard to get them not to at first. desert rose was very pretty but is now a bit stained and sorry looking. never the less she is integral in my children's games still which is nice. one of the more popular ponies we have bought. generally very hard wearing including the accessories the only item which has been broken is the crown which didn't last - it was too thin and got badly bent early on ",positive

" my son received this toy for his first birthday! i will be purchasing it as gifts for all my friends!! he loves pushing the button and listening the the music. i was wondering if he would be able to figure out the gears but he has caught on very quickly and loves to take the gears off and put them back on. he also enjoys stacking the gears up and watching them go around! i like that it has a handle so he can carry it around with him. it keeps him involved for up to 20 minutes at a time! it is very durable as he carries it around has chewed on the gears (which are made of strong plastic and cannot be marred by chewing on them). my three year old also likes to play with it! her play is a little sofisticated with it as she tries to figure out which gears have to be put where (as in do they have to be next to the middle spinning one) placed to make them spin and how many can be stacked and they still turn. my one wish is that playskool would include a few extra gears. we have them everyhwere in our house and cannot always find them all. it would be great if they had a place where you could purchase extra ones for replacements and/or to have extras for stacking. this is an awesome toy that the kids love can learn from and is very durable! it is a must have!

" this is one of the few toys it seems which has remained fundamentally unchanged since we were children. the push-stick is shaped a little differently (i remember a thin blue broom stick with an orange or red handle) but otherwise it is the same. no electronic sounds or flashing lights have been added - although you can get it that way too if you want. personally i think these things detract from the imagination building aspects of certain toys. i'm not saying we have no talking or musical or flashing toys but it dismays me when these things are added to the classics (think little people farm etc). what i love about this toy is it can be anything. it's a sweeper! it's a carpet cleaner! it's a mop! it never fails to crack me up when my son comes running after me with his corn popper when i am cleaning. it's a lawnmower! so many jobs around the house or yard can be copied with the corn popper. and if mom or dad isn't up to much it's still great fun to run around with which means exercise for the kiddies. it's a solo toy and a playing-with-other-kids toy. any time we have other children over to play the corn popper comes out as they chase each other about the house. we got this toy when my son was 13 months. he is now 3y4m and still playing with this toy. i have seen 5 and 6 year olds still playing with the corn popper. there are few toys that are so simple and yet offer so much fun. sturdy too - very important as it's bound to be crashed into a few walls. i can't think of another toy which will give you more bang for your buck - unless you count dirt and measuring spoons and all those other free things that kids so exasperatingly pick over the toys you paid good money for. i am a little alarmed at the current price listed for this toy though. you should not need to pay that much for it. occasionally this item becomes hard to find - especially at christmas - but usually there are tons of them in the stores for around the cost of a president hamilton. right now this is listed for twice that.

" we purchased the item hoping that it would be of reasonable size meaning the food would be closer to real size rather than miniature. it was. we also hoped it would be made well and stand up to hopefully more than one generation of use. that remains to be seen but the stuff is made well and i cannot see it breaking unless you deep-freeze the plastic pieces and hit them with a hammer. nice texture nice flexibility pretty realistic looks. the child it was intended for (age 4 and a bit) plays happily with it even the older boys (10 and 13) have had a few moments of goofy fun with it ",positive

" i purchased this expansion set along with the thomas and friends water towr figure 8 set for my 2 year old this past christmas. the expansion set was an afterthought prompted in no small part by the manufacturer's promotion running at the time (50% off this set with the purchase of a figure 8 set). with the conclusion of many initial hours of intense playtesting (an ongoing process with no termination in sight) my son agrees that this is an essential choice for any but the most basic (read: boring) wooden railroad layout. this expansion pack comes with switch tracks and allows little train engineers (and their dads) to reverse directions or explore different parts of the railway. in retrospect i think that i would have been dissatisfied had i not purchased this set to complement the basic figure 8 layout promotional price or not. as far as the quality the learning curve wooden track is made from hardwood and is more substantial than many other brands of compatible track (i.e. maxim first learning etc.). this is a consideration when your child insists on taking the track apart by him/herself to put away. we have already broken a couple of pieces of generic track this way since the male end of the connectors is a bit weaker than the rest of the track. overall we are quite satisfied with this set and look forward to many more hours of enjoyment ",positive

" i started playing this game in it's original german version. which went through some revision as the expansion decks were put out. as a result the english version may end up being a little more together as you get the expansion decks. talk about a wonderful game to play for two people! it is absolutely well put together though certainly different in playing than the boardgame version of catan. it uses the same notions but has a far more dynamic involvement within the game play itself. the expansion packs are absolutely great and overall add lots of options and twists to the play of the game. it takes a couple of hours and a signicant amount of table space. it travels well enough in it's box but to actually play it you need time and lots of space. i highly recommend it especially if you are only two people and looking for a game that you can play that is fun involving and certainly full of strategy. this is one of the many wonderful games made by klaus teuber and i hope he keeps coming up with winners ",positive
" this is a great game for two players (and two players only). the first one or two times i played it was very very slowgoing because there is a lot to take in. however once you adapt to the numerous cards and they become familiar to you games tend to take about an hour. it's a fairly involved game so you have to be in the mood for that. there's a lot of strategy and many ways to win. i greatly recommend it for those who already enjoy playing games. it might be daunting for a really casual gamer though. if you like it there are now expansion sets available that add lots of spice and variety to the original ",positive

" i stumbled upon this game years ago and my family has enjoyed it--even my adult friends who seemed to balk at first at playing a kids' game. this past year i decided to purchase it for my sixth grade classroom. i must say...wow. i allowed the kids to play it for a while during homeroom and kids would be waiting early outside the room to get in and snag the frog juice. they would even play it over other outdoor games at recess. anytime you heard a noooo! in the room you knew someone had pulled out the witch wash. the kids loved it. so i have come back to purchase a new deck for this upcoming year. to any educators who might be reading this it makes a great addition to the intermediate classroom for those few minutes of downtime and because of the math and bit of strategy involved you don't feel guilty about it at all. plus it is something different and for the teacher inexpensive as far as games go ",positive

" i recently purchased this game using a gift certificate. my little boy loves it. i think it's quite interesting as well but there were several typos on the game cards. frankly there needs to be better proof reading. was this game assembled and printed in another country other than the usa. that would probably account for it ",positive

" we purchased this game for our son for christmas. he is a chess lover and we wanted to get him something a little different. chaturanga was perfect since it is the precursor to chess. he has enjoyed the game. all of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition. it is an attractive box. we are very pleased with every aspect of it ",positive
" chaturanga is the oldest known form of chess. it dates back to india in the seventh century a.d. front porch classics has carefully re-created this game and it is now available to everyone! the game itself is beautiful. it is played on a fabric playing board (all games were once played on fabric it's extremely portable and cheap and cardboard wasn't even invented until the late 1800's!). unlike chess the game can be played with two to four players. each player gets 8 playing pieces made of clay: a raja an elephant a horse (cavalry) a ship and four infantrymen. these pieces are kept in beautiful velvet bags. each piece does have a loose equivalent in modern chess. the raja is the most important piece much like the king. the elephant acts much like the rook. the ship is the bishop and you cannot capture a raja with the ship. the cavalry moves exactly like a knight. the infantry which in this game look kind of like tiny buddhas in lotus position are like the pawns. the big difference between chaturanga and chess is that chaturanga is played with a four-sided die (it's a long rectangle instead of a perfectly square cube). the die tells you which piece you have to move. the game is somewhat easier to learn than chess but easily as much fun. the game can and should be used by teachers and parents to introduce their children to the history and culture of india. the rulebook includes lots of interesting information about india as well as about the history of the game. the game comes in a convenient bookshelf edition where the game is kept in a beautiful book-shaped box that looks great on any bookshelf or coffee table ",positive
" we bought this for our daughter's first birthday. she was immediately interested and so was her three-year-old brother. in addition her five cousins (ages 5-16) and their father (36)were also captivated. there are eleven gears in five colors that spin when the button is pushed. initially she loved to take the gears off and teeth on them. she is fourteen months now and puts them back on. she presses the button to watch them spin. she has taken it to the sitter's and the kids there have played with it all day. when we take it to the sitter's i put it in a bag because the gears do not stay on when the toy is vertical. so farit appears to be a toy that will grow with her as she and her brother play with it differently. we rotate toys but i leave this one out continuously and i often find her playing with it quietly by herself. i have given it five stars because it offers a variety of ways to play (the gears can even be stacked) is different from all other toys they have appeals to a wide range of ages grows with the child does not use up batteries (we are still on the first set) and seems very durable. i recommend this toy ",positive
" this game is a great way to pass twenty to thirty minutes. it is very easy to learn and does not have any pieces to lose or money to count. the strategies however are numerous and there is an equal amount of luck as skill involved in good gameplay. i really liked how the game could only be played with two people as i was tired of games that could be played with two but which were really meant to be enjoyed by three or more... game contents: 1 deck of game cards and one small board. note: if you want to make this game really portable you don't even need to bring the board. it is just a place to put discarded cards and a way to help organize your cards. as long as you have a pencil and paper for scoring at the end of the game you can play it everywhere that you have a table. (i figure you need as much space to lay down your cards as the size of a typical monopoly board). playing note: one thing that was initially a little confusing to us when we were reading the instructions was that the instructions do not explain that you are to place your cards on the opposite side of the board as your opponent. you can each play all 5 expeditions in a head to head manner. we were sitting on a couch at a coffee table and we had turned the board horizontally to face us (instead of vertically) and the instructions were confusing until we moved the board 90 degrees. the game designers assumed that you would play the game as one would play a game of checkers sitting across from one another but you don't actually have to play this way even though you do need to turn your board for the same effect. this game is really fun and i would highly recommend other games from the same manufacturer (rio grande games). they really have a knack for publishing great strategy games. they even release expansion sets to their popular games and they credit the players who gave them the ideas for the expansion cards. pretty neat ",positive
" this is the first game i've tried by the venerable reiner knizia. i was really taken in by the combination of simple rules but interesting strategy. since then i've purchased several of his games. for those who like lost cities but also have a soft spot for poker try battleline. samurai is a great introduction to the sometimes complicated world of tile games with tigres and euphrates being the much more complicated cousin (although again the rules aren't that complicated...the difficulty comes via strategic decision making.) so far my all time favorite knizia game...and frankly one of my favorite games period is modern art. the game mechanics are fairly simple easily explained in 5 minutes with some of the more complex bidding rules explained in a trial game. essentially it's a game about playing an auction...who is the best at playing the market guessing at art values and spending money wisely. it's also a true crossover game... non-gamers or those only exposed to the standard monopoly trivial pursuit etc will quickly learn how much fun it can be... and will probably be asking to play again ",positive
" lost cities is a really fun game and very addictive. i've personally played over 200 matches already on the free online version available at http://www.flexgames.com/ check it out and play against some really good players across the globe and get a feel for the game itself before buying. i've had my name in the notification list for this game on amazon.com for some time now so i'll definitely be purchasing it right away ",positive

" my two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles. they're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles. it's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but aren't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles. there's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge. the only downside are some of the very small pieces...definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3 ",positive
" well this is the expansion for settlers of catan and a lot of things have changed. the ability to build military forces adds depth to the game as does the city improvements. the abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone. the expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours. my only complaint is that in several games the barbarians have not beaten us once they are way too easy. however this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own. all in all this makes a great game totally awesome ",positive
" maybe it's my computer or browser but the picture here doesn't do this doll justice. i bought one at my local drug store before i saw it here at amazon. i can tell you that this beach glam barbie is gorgeous! the picture here looks faded to me but i have the doll right here in front of me and the pink accessories are a lovely perfect shade of vivid pink not pale or washed out as it appears to be in this photo.

" this is a great barney musical songbook and can also be used as a play piano. it's great that it has an auto turn off after non-use. however if it is turned off and something touches it it automatically turns on by itself. many times after the kids went to bed and we happen to put something on top of the barney sing 'n play songbook it turns on by itself. because the songbook does not have a physical turn off switch and something touches it barney will start talking in the silent room when the kids are asleep. just wish it has an on/off switch so it will not be turned on accidentally. otherwise my 3 year old loves it ",positive
" my son got this toy for his birthday about a year ago when he was two. it was one of the gifts we let him pick out on his own. he loved it and played with nothing else for a week! the songs are cute and familiar to him plus barney talks and sings to the music. the only draw backs were that i couldn't find an off button and that it is $20+ at local retailers. i wish the toys companies would cut us parents a little slack. lol ",positive

" my little granddaughters loved receiving this. especially after they figured out the sandbox works best when not dumped on each others heads and the lawn ",positive
" we have had this sandbox for five years. it has been durable and my two kids ages 3 and 5 just love it. color of the plastic is still bright and has been under sun for years. sometimes water seeps in when it rains but this makes sand play even funner for kids. we tend to put a rock on top of lid to keep it in place though it does cover the box perfectly. it is also nice that the lid is attached to the box itself and is easy for kids to remove and put back on when done. the kids usually sit outside of it though it can accomodate 1-2 small kids inside it as well. i find most kids dont want to get sand all over and end up sitting outside of it regardless. overall good investment and the kids love it ",positive
" i noticed that this ladybug sand box only had 3&amp;1/2 stars and the others all had 5. i felt a need to speak up. we bought this sandbox for our first son when he was three. we lived in an apartment with a small back patio. it was perfect not too big but still room for a toddler or two to sit in it and play. he played for hours!! now 5 years later his little brother loves it and my first son almost 9 still plays with the little one in it. it still looks brand new nestled under the tree in our big back yard. it's really great just smaller than the others. we have since given this for every two year old birthday present we've bought! i highly recommend it ",positive
" i give this toy low marks for educational value for two reasons: first humans were not contemporary to the brontosaurus and second the egg is too big to have been laid by the adult dinosaur included in the set. my mother sent this toy as a gift for my son's first birthday. the package suggests this toy for ages 2-5 and in typical fashion my son found the box to be just as interesting as the toy itself but my three-year-old daughter was immediately and completely enchanted with the toy. she began role-playing with the dinosaurs right away. i love you very much said the mama dinosaur to her baby. supercute ",positive

" i just bought this yesterday and surprised my girls (3 and 5) with it today. it does blow tons of bubbles! they love chasing them all over the yard. the gazillion bubble solution that comes with it is cool because the bubbles are really colorful when they come out. it does used 8 aa batteries as previously mentioned but there is an order from inside to send away for an adaptor. yes it has a plug for an adaptor to plug it in so you don't use so many batteries. where i'll plug it in in the backyard i'm not sure yet. i definitely recommend for the young children that are so excited by bubbles ",positive

" this thing is great. our 4 year old loves it. the working drawbridge breakaway wall for cannon fire and trap door are great. considering the size and number of pieces it was remarkably easy to put together. allow 2 to 3 hours for assembly but the directions are excellent. only complaint is that some of the small pieces that don't always want to stay together - some of the details will likely be missing after a few weeks. overall very happy with it ",positive
" my son received this toy as a present from his father on christmas (dec '05) and he was able to play with it straight out of the box. i bought my son the v smile system and he can't use that as easily as he uses the read with me system. while a agree with some of the previous reviews that this system would not take him to seven years old it does build his confidence level and keeps him motivated to keep playing because he was getting the answers right. while with the v smile system he prefers i play and he watch. so i am happy with this purchase and will buy more dvds for the system. i have only one complaint and that is i wish they would use both traditional stories and use some of the newer characters. my son loves thomas the train and even though he has the little engine that could i think he would also like to see thomas the tank engine dora the explorer and maybe even some books in foreign languages. but all in all a great system for the younger preschool children.

" i was skeptical at first and i am so happy that i got this for my kids. i homeschool my children and needed something to keep one of the kids busy while i was working with another. this is easy to use fun to play and i like the stories that are available. i think you get a great product for a great price ",positive

" this is a must-have item if you want to add the clock tower to your set. it also works well with the other elevation sets particularly mile high mountain. the set includes the following: 4 ramps (these are made from two shorter pieces that are screwed together) 2 curves 2 short straights 2 guard rails 2 end ramps 8 arches (2 supports and 1 crosspiece each) the crosspieces of the arches have a picture of how the ends of the track should be aligned. the screws are a little tough but never need to be removed. the set is enough to run up two full levels and back down again (my son has played with this set just by itself having fun running up around and racing back down). you can also make two single-level bridges a single level bridge and a ramp down from mile high mountain or many other setups. this set literally adds a new dimension to a geotrax set. lots of fun. the short pieces also allow for different configurations that may have been frustrating in the past. definitely fun.

" there are so many great things about this that i don't know where to start. availability--price--shipping--the list goes on and on. bottom line is that my daughter is a big care bear fan and it's impossible to find this bear anywhere else. it arrived quickly was just as described (in fact it was softer) and occupies a place of honor on my daughter's bed. i give it a 5 only because that's the highest. makes a wonderful gift!!

" this doll looks like it will be a collectible in a few years. the lucy in paris barbie is already worth more than double what it was selling for a few years ago. this doll will probably go up in value as well. in regards to the person who returned this doll twice for a slightly dented box...get a life! who in the hell would return a doll just because the box had a dent! if the doll wasn't damaged why are you returning it???? it's life nothing's perfect get over it! you can't expect perfection...as long as the item itself isn't damaged there's no reason to make a big fuss over the cardboard box it comes in! this is a nice doll (even if the box is dented) and i would recommend purchasing it. i ordered this doll and the box mine came in was in good shape (to me anyway). as far as i know buyers on ebay aren't extremely picky on the condition of the box...they are more concerned on the condition of the doll and whether or not it is still in the box.

" i'm not sure why so many of these (all?) reviews are for a different product but this one is actually for the balancing bike. we got this for our son for christmas and he loves it. he just turned 5 and has a bike with training wheels but it's still too big for him. i don't really like the idea of training wheels anyway so i started looking for something like this balancing bike. i saw a german one for $350 so i was thrilled to find this one for under $100. it was so easy to assemble. i love that the seat height adjusts. my son rides it around the house and after just a few tries was able to coast down the hall on it with his feet off the floor. i think it's a much better way to learn to ride a bike. the quality is good the seat has a bit of padding and i expect it will hold up well for my other child when she's old enough to ride it in a couple more years. i gave it four stars instead of five because it's put together with screws it's not fine craftsmanship. best buy in its category though ",positive
" i loved this trike! it was given to my son for his first birthday and he loved it. daycare was in walking distance (i lived in the city) and i used the trike to take him. my son loved to hold onto the handle bars it gave him a sence of freedom from the stroller that he hated. my son is now three years old and i am buying a new one for my one year old. i understand some people give this product bad reviews but there is a 1-800 number that goes with the toy. the brand radio flyer is well known and the customer service line is very helpful and willing to replace parts or defects. this is the only gift that was given to my son that i can say i love and have had for more than just one year! enjoy ",positive
" we recently purchased this playhouse and discovered that it does not come with the peek-a-boo shutters (i don't see the shutters in the photo either although they are mentioned in the product description). our 3year old and 18 month old both enjoy it but i would say it is more fun for the 18 month old than my 3 year old since there is little to actually do inside the house. the doorbell makes fun sounds. it is very easy to put together ",positive
" even though i dont have this i think is the most cutest thing i have ever seen ",positive
" i give this 4 stars because i like it (maybe more than my toddler). when i was in kindergarten or 1st grade my little brother who was 1 or 2 at the time had the original -- the one that just popped and he loved it. he would push it around until the popping drove my father crazy. this one does even more. it pops counts from 1 to 10 plays music and has flashing lights. i think it's an awesome toy especially for the price. my daughter doesn't play with it every day but when she grabs it she'll push it around for maybe 10 minutes or more (we haven't found a single toy that will occupy her attention for longer than that). sometimes she'll push it around several times a day. it's great for that stage when your toddler likes to push or drag things around with them. the popping was inconsistent when we first received it but we took it apart got the gears aligned correctly (through trial & error) added more vaseline to the gears for lubrication and now it pops counts plays music and the lights flash consistently every time. if you take this toy apart be careful not to pull out the speaker wires -- we did that but it was no problem. my husband soldered the wires back together ",positive
" i bought this game two weekends ago and have had both fun and frustration with it. i'm a freecell junkie and have gone so far as to download a better version (more games) than the one that came with my computer. i lost track of how many total games i've played over the years since i've used several computers but i play about 10 games a day on average. i'm very competitive and love keeping track of my stats. unfortunately that is the weakness of this version of the game. for example if you get into a position were you can move only one card back and forth between two columns and there are no other moves all you can do is hit the replay button or move on to another game. if you hit the replay button you don't get a loss recorded which of course you should. consequently it is easy to run up a high win percentage with this version of the game just by resigning a game when you think you are going to loose and replay it. then when you finally win you get credit for a win. of course that is not proper scoring either. also there is a key combination that when you do lose a game outright and want to replay you don't get any further losses counted against you. that's as it should be. the only problem is that key combination is very flaky and doesn't always work. other than scoring inconsistencies it's a great game! it's very easy to use. although different to use than playing with a mouse on your computer if you've played a lot on your computer you'll pick up the operation of this version almost immediately. the display is large and easy to see and there is a low light level sensor on the front that will automatically light the screen when you are playing in an area with poor lighting. that is a great feature. i love playing this game while sitting in the airport waiting to board a plane and on the plane itself while in the air. it's a great and challenging way to pass the time away if you like playing solitaire. on the next version of this game i hope they will beef up the statistics capabilities of the unit ",positive
" my 3 year old loves this toy. he has a lot of the krypto toys and getting mechanikat was essential. we just got it for christmas so am not sure of its longevity. it does seem to be pretty well made. also got snooky wookems with it. great for fans of the krypto cartoons ",positive

" this is without a doubt the best [...] we have spent on a toy for our 7-year-old son but it isn't a toy. it's a highly functional albeit inexpensive metal detector. we've had it now for 3 years and take it camping etc. it will easily find something as small as a rusty staple and will detect a railroad spike as far as 4 1/4 inches down very good if you consider how small the detection coil is. when camping the kids love to find and dig up ancient tent stakes rusty nails and the occasional coin. adjusting the sensitivity is trivial just hold it away from any metal and turn the sensitivity knob until the red detector led just goes out. other reviewer has noted that the three-piece shaft breaks easily which happened on ours but a little duct tape goes a long way and this shouldn't stop you from buying one. if you get one make sure to bury some coins and other treasures in the garden for the kids to find. ps it also really works great for locating studs and plumbing pipes in walls ",positive
" this is perfect for any stop-motion animator. with over 30 posable joints thoron is inexpensive compared to other figures.also thoron's nemosisstendhal is a great figure for animation ",positive
" after three years of dragons who walk on all fours we get a dragon who stands upright. seems kind of strange. thoron's debut appearance was in the fire & ice portal of fire set. he makes another appearance here in the metal ages and he looks a lot meaner here. perhaps the rigors of battle are wearing on him. i bought stendhal first and was very pleased with him. i found thoron to be somewhat disappointing. he's got some great detail but he's not as articulated as stendhal is. replacing the standard light-up feature is a dragon roar feature. thoron doesn't light up but he has a variety of growls and roars that are activated by a button on his chest. his articulation is pretty decent. his hind legs (which he stands on) are stiff and can only move back and forth. but it gets much better when we examine his arms and head. his arms can move back and forth and away from his body. the shoulder joint can move in two directions. we get two additional points of articulation at the elbows and wrists. thoron's wrists aren't as versatile as stendhal's are (stendhal's wrists can turn in addition to the claw moving back and forth). his neck can move left and right and his head can move in all manner of directions. as always his jaw opens. his tail is flexible for super-posability as are his towering wings. he can also turn at the waist. my complaints with thoron's articulation are twofold. it would've been nicer if his hind legs were posable and it definitely would've been nice if his wrists were articulated like stendhal's are. thoron is mostly dark green with white highlights on his wings white claws on his feet and silver colored armor. as mentioned the detail here is better than ever and everything has a realistic look. he comes with a removable piece of armor for his head. i think he looks better without it but maybe that's just me. thoron is one of the most charismatic dragons i've seen (it's all in the face and eyes). he looks kind of mean and vicious. stendhal is supposed to be the bad guy and he doesn't look this mean. the original thoron from the fire & ice series has a better facial expression. this action figure comes almost completely assembled. i just had to attach his wings. also included are some parts for building a small tower with decorative blades and flag and a draigar warrior with shield and weapon. all things considered thoron isn't quite as nice as stendhal is. nevertheless he gets a thumbs up from me. he's a good addition to any dragons collection and a fun action figure to play around with ",positive
" my 9 month old son loves this toy! it's easily his favorite toy. he'll gladly do tummy time hitting the piano keys and hitting the dial and characters. he has a great time making it go and will now sit up and scoot the car a little. his other toys were good for a couple weeks at best this one he only seems to be enjoying more the longer he plays with it. the music is not nearly as loud or as annoying as most toys and is actually a little fun. well worth the purchase price ",positive

" pixter is a fantastic learning tool for ages 3+. as a parent i love that many of the learning activities are based around drawing and creating so the child is not only gaining knowledge but also creating art at the same time. my son who will be 2 in a few weeks has a pixter and though he is far below the age recommendation he absolutely adores drawing with his pixter. he is very gentle with it and it can keep him entertained for hours. compared to the leapfrog leapster pixter has many more creativity-based activities and leapster tends to be more of an arcade-style system. however the leapster cartridges are much easier to find and there is a bigger selection of titles. i plan to purchase the leapster for my son for his 3rd birthday because the l-max can play games on the tv as well as on the handheld. also contrary to popular belief the pixter is not being discontinued as of this writing. i spoke with a representative at fisher price myself and she said that they are redesigning the system with new colors but not discontinuing it or any of the software. beware when purchasing these games on ebay for ridiculous prices from people claiming they are discontinued. wait for the stores to restock after the holidays and it will be a different story ",positive

" this is the first rc (radio control) aircraft i have ever flown although i have raced rc cars for quite awhile. it comes fully assembled with a nice manual and even a quick intro dvd to get you in the air quickly. i started out in my living room and it has worked just great. with just a little trimming out the heli is very stable and easy for which to get a feel. i've run it for a few hours now with no incidents and i'm getting pretty good at hovering although i still have a tough time with head-in flight (controls thus reversed). the blade cx rtf makes a great first heli or just a great indoor heli. probably fine for anyone over 10 years old. i am getting 10-15 minutes of flight time on a battery charge. the only disappointment is that charging a battery takes 60-90 minutes (typical with all lipo batteries). i'd recommend getting an extra battery or two and maybe even an extra powersupply and charger. also i have tried the training gear add-on for the blade cp/cp pro -- it fits the cx just fine and allows you to use it later if you move on -- and it helps with damage but makes the blade cx slightly less stable in hover in my opinion but not terribly so. they're probably worth the trade off at first. in a few more hours i think i'll be ready to move up to the blade cp pro. highly recommended for anyone interested in entering rc helicopters or who just wants a heli to fly around the house. two good sites for further info are [...] ",positive
" we have the original &quot;super mastermind&quot; which is the exact same layout. it's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache. it's fun to watch others work at it too. the pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it. it's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts ",positive

" we just got this for my daughter's 5th birthday. this toy was what received the greatest excitement. while opening presents my daughter exclaimed at the the top of her lungs i got a brietta pegasus! the pegasus itself is durable beautiful and creatively sparks hours of imaginitave play. i didn't think it was a big deal trying to get it out of the box. many toys are packaged that way these days... perhaps an anti-theft plan. i just got some scissors and brietta was out to play. so far we also haven't had any trouble with the wings. if they do fall out occasionally- they pop right back in. a small price to pay for such a well-loved toy that my 5 year old plays with for hours. as a mom who also loved unicorns and pegasus ponies as a girl i'm glad i can give that magic to my own girls ",positive

" i went online to look for other little tikes toys with the handle and saw that this truck - which my 17-month old son loves - only had two stars and i wondered why. i disagree with most of the other reviews. the handle on top makes it easy for him to push around and carry - he can run it up slopes on the ground anywhere. he has never fallen or injured himself on it. in fact his frustration occurs because he can only pull the dump truck end up about 50% of the time. usually he just hands it to me and points that he wants it open. i do agree that the handle does make it difficult to put large items in the back and that the opening at the end of the dump truck makes it difficult for items to fall out. this is the only reason i'm not giving this toy five stars. but my son loves this truck and has pretty much been playing with it constantly since we got it about a month ago. i'm planning to get him the train with the handle because he likes this toy so much.

" we stretched it across our pool but we have a stoper in the line so you fall in the pool. we just used some special clamps and a high compression spring. the kids love it because they can fly right into the pool ",positive
" it's cute well packaged and easy (but time consuming) to put together. for the price it can't be beat. too bad there's no photo. she'll use it for a while and we'll sell it online when we are done and probably get most of our money back ",positive
" this is the perfect size swimming pool for my 21 month old. she loves this pool. i love the fact that only the top ring has to be blown up then once you start filling it with water - it stands up. less risk of tears or holes! the only thing i would recommend would be some sort of cover for it since it does not come with one ",positive
" my daughter got this pool for her first birthday and she loves it. this pool is big enough that i can just get in with her and we have a blast. because of her age i don't fill it up all the way and it still works just fine. (it just looks a little funny) i found it really easy to set up and easy enough to pack away. i was a little confused at first when folding it up but within moments i had it put away and every time i use it i find it easier and easier. this pool is great for traveling to grandma's house too! i would recommend this to anyone young and old ",positive
" i was pleasantly surprised at the quality and size of the pool. the price is quite reasonable and i was not expecting such a great deal ",positive
" i liked the pool for this very hot summer that we have had; i would recommend a cover for it ",positive
" these weebles are bigger then the ones that come with the box sets ",positive
" t.j. is a great learning tool for children. all the stories have been wonderful lessons for children as well as helping them to read ",positive
" when my 3-month old nephew received this for christmas my 15-month old and 3-year old immediately started fighting over it. they played with it so much that we decided to buy our own even though i thought they might be too old for it. two months later it is still the hottest toy in our house. the shapes are vibrant colors rattle and have rounded edges making them easier than most shape sorters for younger children. the top and bottom pieces screw off to remove the shapes and my 3-year old can take them on and off herself. my kids also like to lay the top and bottom pieces on the floor and set the shapes on them like it is a puzzle. they also like to play catch by rolling the sorter back and forth to each other. i would say this is one of the best toys you can buy for a 6-18 month old ",positive
" i wanted my daughter to be able to listen to music without headphones. this product the fp3 speakers was perfect. she loves to walk around from room to room singing her favorite songs and carrying this around. it is easy to turn on and very kid friendly. the only downfall is that the price dropped right after i purchased it! ",positive
" my son received this when he was 15 months old and has never stopped playing with it regularly. he loves putting things in the back and zooming around the living room. great buy ",positive
" very pretty game and fun; but for older children. this game has way too many cards to be played properly for my [..]. this is going to stay on the shelf until she can play with all the cards ",positive
" what a great game! my 4 year old loves the disney princess. it is such a great educational toy. we love it ",positive
" this game is make-involve make-think and fun. side effects leave you much smarter. its fun game for parties driving everyone to involvement and fun. art of asking questions and elimination gets better and better just by playing this game !!!!!. strongly recommended for parents who want their kids to spend time on creative and learning game yet fun. they can be be part of game and share there thoughts. though it recommends age 10+ might as well be good for 7+ to 100+ ... i wish i had this game little earlier never stop telling how much its fun and good for personality development!! ",positive
" this is a game that will help you practice while you are having fun to ask the right questions to zero in on the answer and at the same time keeping tab of the progress. i believe it is the right questions that you ask that help you succeed in a game or in life.this is a game with a educational value that will enhance your creative thinking with a dose of fun.if you liked pictionary you will love questionary.

" much smaller than i imagined it would be but then again i am not very good with measurements. it is a very cute doll and my niece loved it ",positive
" i bought her and veronica too! i love to them!!i play archie and date them..they are my fun girls!! my wife likes them too ",positive
" she's a beautiful doll. i love the blonde ponytail and the make-up is fine. i even like the jeans. but why the ugly white untucked shirt and the super-short pink sweater??? it just looks takcy to me. if i buy her she will be wearing a new shirt right away. other than that she's a lovely doll. and i like the previous reviewer also remember and love the archie comics from my childhood. a 5 star doll except for the shirt ",positive
" i have loved reading archie comics since i was in high school. i was thrilled to find the archie dolls for sale. thanks ",positive
" this is absolutely adorable. not only is it a great jack in the box for a boy or a girl but you can also play peek a boo with the monkey. my daughter is 20 months old and she loves it!!! ",positive
" we purchased this set for my son christmas 2003. he loves it. the age range on the listing is off though. it should be the same for any of the little people toys - 12 or 18 months and up. there are no small parts. highly recommended and fun during the holidays or any time ",positive
" this was the webkinz my daughter wanted and she's been very happy with it. there was a delivery problem but the seller from whom i bought it was a pleasure to deal wit ",positive
" we bought two sets of the alphabet foam play mats - so glad we did! we have a concrete basement floor and now the kids have a nice colorful and soft place to play. plus the foam floor isn't as cold as the concrete - wer're in colorado. the colors are great - so inviting. the pieces fit together perfectly and the border gives it a finished look. great purchase! we'll probably buy more so that we can increase the size of the play area! ",positive
" he loves the dog. i has very happy to find him. since toy story was out 10 years ago i did not thing i would ever find slink my grandsons favorite ",positive
" along this is not the most exhilirating toy. however my son has collected many of the toy story toys and enjoys playing with all of them together. for any child who does this you need to have slinky do ",positive
" i added this toy to my son's xmas list. with much luck he did get it; and we are pleased ! i would not say that it's a fun to play with toy but the entertainment value still exists. the planets are large enough without being overbearing up on the ceiling. they glow at night..which is the best part !! at 36 years old i can't wait for nighttime to hang in my sons room to check out the planets! the stars the set comes with are perfect. they are not the bulky plastic ones that can be seen day or night. they are paper stickers that disappear during the day (on the celing they do anyway) the planets come with name stickers which adds educational value. my son is five and loves loves loves these planets. i say get 'em !! lisa avilio-meyer ",positive
" my nephew who is 3 years old got my first leappad not to long ago and he loves it. he loves train so he got one that is thomas the train and he playes it the morning when he get up and at night before he goes to sleep. there are many different types and they are everywhere you just have to know where to look. for instance [...] over all i think this is an amazing learning toy for toddler and young kids who look forward to reading and writting. ",positive
" i really like my first leap pad and so does my 3 year old son. i bought it for him for christmas last year (he was 2 1/2 then)and though some the activities we're alittle hard for him to start with there were still plenty of things he could do with it.every picture you touch the pen on says a frase/says the name of the object or make a soundso even without playing the games he still had great fun with it. a year onhe can now play all the games on it and has recently noticed letters make wordsso now he touches the words and the leap pad reads it for himso he is still learning from this toy after a year! i will be buying more my first leap pad books for him this christmasthis toy is worth every penny ",positive
" got this as a gift and it was one of the first things she played with well more like laid and stared at. now she's 4 1/2 months old and she still loves it. she loves to grab at the fish shake the rattle and twirl the lobster. for awhile it was a whole new toy every week because she would notice something new on it. great for putting her down and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat. also good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom. music isn't too annoying either ",positive
" great poseability and a fun transformation. the super robot mode helmet is a little goofy looking when it's on but other than that he's fantasti ",positive
" thease dolls are ok i agree with the other reviewer that the third edtion is wayyyyyyyy better roxxi is kinda ugly lol phope is nic ",positive
" my 22-month-old has loved this toy for almost a year. the shapes are attractively colored and very pleasing to hold and the attached hammer never gets lost! all in all a very nice version of a timeless toy ",positive
" my 5 and 7 year-old granddaughters love baby alive. this doll held their attention even to the exclusion of the other stuff they really wanted for christmas. and the doll is adorable! even the adults were fascinated. fun and educational ",positive
" i've enjoyed playing this game with people from around the world- it seems to work best with a group of people who haven't been hanging out together since childhood. it gets people talking and makes for an evening of all sorts of interesting stories- and you get to find out what interesting people your friends are ",positive
" this is perfect for any kurt cobain/nirvana fan. it looks great definitely reminiscent of the smells like teen spirit music video. i bought it as a gift but almost kept it for myself! if you are thinking of getting it i would recommend you do so. you won't be disappointed ",positive
" this is a very pretty doll. i waited until this year to buy her and got her for only fifteen dollars. in my opinion that is the only way to buy these fancy dolls--on sale! otherwise they are just too darn expensive. i give this particular doll 4 stars. she has a pretty face and i like her hair. i think the dress is a bit overdone but that is just me. i have very simple tatstes ",positive
" i bought the african-american 2005 holiday barbie for my little girl. i agree with her statement that she's too pretty to play with!!. mattel did an amazing job this year. the face on this doll is exquisite. miss 2005 is absolutely proportionate in classic barbie terms. the gown's colors definitely put you in a festive spirit. in fact the ball gown as a whole is supernaturally beautiful. picking bob mackie as this year's designer was nothing short of genius. when i saw that mackie was the holiday designer i knew that mattel had finally gotten it right! ",positive
" this is a great toy i play with it all the time and it still works ",positive
" really nice toy. but i don't understand why there are only 3 knobs on the grill but there are 4 burners...i think this might confuse some of our future fast food employees.... ",positive
" i remember playing this game as a kid. im sure glad someone still makes it. good family fu ",positive
" i don't have the tin version but an earlier version. the cards look different but the game is played the same. i have been playing this with my now current 10 year old for 2 years and we both love it. a little luck some strategy and a whole lot of fun. don't let the age levels fool you-adults will enjoy this as well. a classic that will never go out of style ",positive
" my 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last christmas and for the first couple of months was used practically every day. (and yes i agree with the rest of the reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them and prepare to be disappointed since it cannot pull many cars up the hills without getting stuck.) i will tell you that i cannot believe my son has not touched this engine since. his complaint is that all it does is go around and around. instead he enjoys playing out stories from thomas or making up his own train sagas. my husband likes to watch the engine more than my son. i don't know how other children play with their trains but the battery operated engines just cannot hold his attention for very long. nevertheless for the first few months watching it is really mesmerizing i could watch it for hours. perhaps instead of buying this one engine purchase a setup with more cars and track for the same money. it will probably get more use in the end ",positive
" why people purchase a toy for tikes when it is specifically targeted at older kids is beyond me. always look at the box for the minimum age a toy is best for. that said all ltto taggers including this one have a simple grab and go game called ltag. all you have to do is pull the trigger twice and you're on your way. this is early in the manual way before all the complicated games that frustrate 6 year olds and their parents. i love ltto. i even run a club that uses it here in auburn wa. but i *always* start new players out with ltag then move up to hosted games and then to the more complicated games. never try to start out by hosting a team hide and seek game 'cus it's just too much for a young or completely new player. but that's why the ltag game exists! just grab it and play! no messing with the control panel. don't take a low rating based on an inapproprate purchase as worth much. similarly take my rating with a grain of salt since i'm a huge fan. but for kids 8 and up to adults ltto taggers are a wonderful durable and long lived toy that gets you moving and thinking ",positive
" this was a christmas gift however i can rate it on the base that i own one just like it. this is good for a lifetime of fun ",positive
" this is a challenging game even for adults. it's great for getting both sides of your brain going. questions range from easy to difficult and topics cover pop culture history and science. great game to play with teams ",positive
" we had a blast making up our on questions and playing this game. the guys played it and the guys never want to play games ",positive
" it would be easier to keep score on a book that is not glossy or bound; ink smears pencil does not show up and writing in the crease is difficult. they should include a score book similar to the typical baseball scoring books; spiral bound paper. other than that the product is exactly what we were looking for. ",positive
" my 4.5 year old loves this! awesome way for young kids to learn god's word! i wish there were more. my daughter hasn't put it down since we bought it ",positive
" i purchased this card game as a spur of the moment christmas gift for my son who loves monopoly but can get no one to play the board game because of how long the board game version takes. my son as well as the rest of the family was wonderfully surprised to find this monopoly card game addictive and fun to play. each of the hands goes quickly and the goal of $10000 is very attainable to reach in a fairly short period of time. i will have to admit 3 people was a bit more challenging and fun than just 2 and we decided it would be easier to keep score of the money by using pencil paper and a calculator. overall i highly recommend this version ",positive
" this pack makes this game more fun and allows more people. the rules change a little when using it but they are easy to understand and lots of fun. i highly recommend getting this pack if you have ever wanted to play with more people ",positive
" my 2.5 year old border collie just loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week. since the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey i decided to try this more affordable kid's tunnel instead. it's not as heavy and robust as the official agility tunnels but it has been serving me great for just about a year - there's just some minor wearing around the rings and small toe nail runs in it - but it's still very usable. my ratings would change a bit for kids though - probably a 3 for educational and 5 for durability ",positive
" i've read the other reviews...as i was skimming the website to order another of these wands. guess you folks had a bad batch of wands because my son is crazy about his. we gave it to him shortly after his 2nd birthday and it's one of his favorite toys! yes it is messy...it's a giant bubble wand...when was the last time you played bubbles that there wasn't a mess? but if you keep it out doors i don't see the problem. my son was able to make bubbles right away (something he wasn't able to do with smaller wands since he can't seem to blow (he sucks air in instead of out). his father and i played for over an hour with this wand...taking turns making the bubbles and letting him pop them (and vice versa). i don't know why the other folks had some difficulty...but i would highly recommend this toy for a 2-3 year old. ",positive
" we wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06. we bought a lot of m&d toys and this by far was the better of their toys. even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out. like other said the sound is very appropriate. i like this toy and definitely recommend this to others. the only reason i gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful ",positive
" my mother-in-law purchased the sandbox for my son who was not quite two at the time. he has played with it everday for the last four months straight. i can't even hide it from him. he loves filling the sandbox with other trucks that he has. this toy keeps him occupied for hours. he has so much fun with it that we are using others for his second birthday ",positive
" this is a great (and relatively cheap) way to expand your brio starter set. a nice selection of straights curves and a few switch tracks that really add to the interaction / fun. while brio in general is expensive this track pack represents a pretty good value (v. buying switches curves straights etc on their own.... although you'll need to do that eventually too!). the finish fit and quality is great. worth the money considering the play it'll get & it's durability ",positive
" great idea to hang clothes. the hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on. if your child is like mine who loves to dress and re-dress dolls the armoire is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits. the price is great now. i paid $20. great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer. ",positive
" my 3 yo twin boys love this but one station is a little difficult to maneuver it is very sensitive even for my 6 yo boy. all in all i would recommend this for all those little train lovers! ",positive
" my son loves this game. when moving around the tracks in the one game it can be difficult the key is if you moving up or down depending on which direction you need to go push the joystick the direction once and let go after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go. i hope this helps. my son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks. mom dad and sis had to play before that. the other games are a little easier but i found the games educational and my son loves it ",positive
" my child loves this little crib. i think the canopy was the winning feature and the rollers. she can easily move it without having to carry it to the next room. all her dolls fit the crib. we really think it works. it isn't as sturdy as a wooden crib but it hasn't come apart on us ",positive
" i am the star wars fanatic i really like this toy! it has firing misiles and stickers to put on the vehicle. and you can open the wings! this is a great toy! ",positive
" if you dont have a obiwan pilot just buy a rebel pilot an put it in the ship i did it a i licke it and if you have obiwan imagine it change cloth. i thinck this starfighter is best only for the colors because for me al jedi starfighter are the same and the firing misiles i tacke them out because then they get lost ",positive
" this is an awsome ship! well at least anakins is. my cousin has a green anakin jedi starfighter and i want to get the new obi-wan kenobi one that is coming in september. the only thing that is not good about it is that there is a little opening in the cockpit that anakin's hand (the green ship comes with an anakin that has a normal hand and one holding a lightsaber) fell through ",positive
" i think that this was a great gift and definitely worth the money. i gave this to my 3 1/2 yr old niece as a christmas gift. she loves the wizard of oz. she is a big fan of dress up clothes and i also have two more nieces that roughly the same age so there was an outfit for each of them.

" i bought a set of these uno cards for my 9-year-old grandson a nintendo freak. the first night he had them he played three games with whoever was handy and spent an hour alone arranging the cards just so. he took them to bed with him. a few days later he dashed into his other grandparent's house showing off his fancy deck of uno cards and insisted that they play a game. he even wrote us a thank you note telling us that the cards were the coolest present i ever got. the rules of the game have not changed just the look of the cards. nintendo characters in all their bright colors are the suits. the cards are housed in a metal box a throwback to the front half of the 20th century. excellent art work on the cards and on the box. the cards and the game are appealing to all ages. i enjoyed playing and getting acquainted with the nintendo characters (my grandson explained them all to me). this is a great family game and this nintendo set is a great gift. it helps close the generation gap. i highly recommend this item. enjoy. one last thing: i bought a second deck for another grandson and his response was pretty much the same. ",positive
" now you can add risk to your libary in this handsome bookshelf edition. the game remains a perennial favorite and in this day and age of global conquest you can play out your vicarious need to be king of the world without harming anyone atleast not physically. but be prepared for a few bruised egos especially when combatants start teaming up on weaker victims. while the places and names don't exactly match today's geographical boundaries kids can still get some sense of the world in which we live even if the object of the game remains to wipe each other out ",positive
" love this game. with family and/or friends it's one of the best card games around. it is easy and doesn't require a lot of attention (you can watch movies talk hang out etc.) yet keeps your interest. it's also a game people of many ages can play because it's not too difficult. a good card game for having friends over to play over dinner or while watching a ballgame. ",positive
" i found that for the price. this set was great! it comes with one rascus figure and one shadow knight. the catapult is very orginal and powered by a rubber band i got it to go 3 and a half feet. there were also some improvements in the pieces. for example the flagpole was less annoying the weapons were improved and the head pieces came on and off much smoother. whether you are starting lego castle or are an expert builder this is great set ",positive
" we just got this lego system for our 3 year old son and he loves it! he doesn't want to put it away or out of his sight at any time. the scoop and lofty characters are easy for him to assemble and we are working on the little buildings but he may not be quite old enough yet to assemble them. overall this is a great toy for anyone who loves bob the builder. we can't wait to purchase the other sets to add to the fun!! lego always makes great and challenging toys!

" you need to be old enough to look at a set of several horse cards and decide which kind of horse show a particular hose would do best in and which horse you would get the most points for if you had that particular horse compete in a dressage show jumper show ect. points are added up and who evers horse earned the most points wins that horse show and that player gets to keep the cards. so i would say ages 8 to 12 but younger children could play with help from someone who can read and add up numbers. there is a limited amount of rounds in a game since there is a limited number of cards to play for each horse show so the game last around 15 minutes or so. i like this part a lot since games like war chomp can go on forever. it does take a table top to play the game i originally purchased the game for my daughter thinking she could play it on the bus with a friend but you need to have a surface to lay out some cards. i quess you could try to squeeze them onto a larger text book laid onto your lap. but it wouldn't be easy.

" my toddler and all of her friends love this play house. it is great no assembly required ",positive
" i bought this as a halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004. he loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house. he doesn't really use it much anymore but now my 18 month old loves it! he can actually follow the whole progression turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time. this toy has been great for our family. it is pretty durable some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore but considering what it has gone through it has performed amazingly well ",positive
" well i just think that the little beauty on the cover easily sells this product. can you even imagine her tooting? she's too cute! the slick gentleman blowing on the whistle like it's a saxophone and he plays in a be-bop quartet of fart blowers makes me wonder if he is blowing out both ends. this thing is going to sound like a true to life fart...but without all the hassle of the smell. one warning...do not use this whistle on your key chain as an emergency device. please use a real loud whistle. you wouldn't want to be alone in an empty parking garage with some ghoulish thug chasing you and then you just start blowing your fart whistle to get someone to come to your aid. if i heard farts in an empty parking garage i would most likely run the other way. this whistle is for good times only.

" toby is one of the regulars on the thomas & his friends tv series and this little wooden tram engine is well-made and durable for those who have the wooden railway sets. my only complaint - and this is very minor - is that toby is a bit taller than other wooden thomas engines meaning that he cannot fit under bridges very well ",positive
" my 7 year old son got this set for christmas last year and with all the toys we have for our 5 kids this k'nex set gets the most use. he built with it every day for months and still builds something new about every week with it. he has built about every model in the book and he is getting better at building his own ideas. we've gotten a lot of the models on video tape and he loves to show his grandparents the new ones. i loved the sea turtle that walked across the floor and he builds amusement park rides and puts little people in them. this thing keeps him busy for hours at a time and he's getting another tub of them for his birthday. his little brother wants one for his birthday this year. the motor is very cool and he figures out how to use it with the models that don't call for it. since christmas he has only broken 2 pieces so i thought that was pretty good. highly recommended ",positive
" if you know the movies inside and out this game is fun for the dedicated fan. i play with my son that knows so much more star wars trivia than i do but find the game enjoyable. the only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times the dvd portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck. not sure why they could not load up more questions on the dvd but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old mom that answers so many questions wrong ",positive
" star wars trivial pursuit saga edition (2005.) introduction: despite having been around since the middle of the seventies the star wars series has never declined in its popularity. george lucas created a science fiction phenomenon that has stood the test of time and then some. and needless to say many games have been based on the series - video games role-playing games and no shortage of board games have been adapted for the star wars universe. in 1998 star wars trivial pursuit was released. being a die-hard fan of the series it was by far my favorite (non video game) star wars game ever. unfortunately it outdated fast due to the fact that it didn't cover the prequel trilogy it was immediately followed by. but in 2005 seven years and three star wars episodes later a new version of the game has hit store shelves! read on for my review of the new version of star wars trivial pursuit. overview: quite honestly who doesn't know what trivial pursuit is? well for those of you who have been living under a rock all your life here's the concept behind the game. players alternate rolling a die and moving their game token across a wheel-shaped board. there are six different-colored spaces. each color represents a different category. the player is then asked a question of that category. if he or she gets it right he or she goes again. if he or she misses it it's the next player's turn. at six spots on the board are wedge spaces. the objective of the game is to gain a wedge in all six colors and return to the central hub of the wheel and answer a game-winning question. some changes for this edition of the game are rather obviously the questions and overall game design being star wars based and two dvds which contain the wedge and game-winning questions. a new concept to the game includes a player being able to steal if another player is unable to answer the wedge question in the last few seconds of time. essentially the game play stays play to the classic stylings of trivial pursuit but gives it a star wars overhaul. in other words this game is exactly what it says it is. review: the original star wars trivial pursuit was without question my favorite star wars game of all time that wasn't a video game. this new version is a massive improvement over the old version. for starters the new version covers the entire star wars film saga. the classic galactic civil war trilogy (episodes iv v and vi) and the prequel clone wars trilogy (episodes i ii and iii) all get equal emphasis. if you hated the original version for not covering the prequel trilogy that problem has obviously been corrected and in a major way. the dvds also add a nice new twist to the game. it's good to finally have a method of setting the wedge questions apart from regular questions. and of course you can do anywhere from two to four players or teams. i do have a few minor complaints though. first of all is the selection of the tokens of characters you can play as. the original version had luke skywalker princess leia han solo and darth vader. in other words a nice assortment of main characters. the new version has luke skywalker darth vader obi-wan kenobi and yoda. in other words only jedi characters. this is strictly a cosmetic flaw but still i think they could have picked a better assortment of characters than those four. another complaint is the inclusion of a die. for those of you who never played the original version of the game it included an electronic r2d2 figurine which would tell you how many spaces to move when you tapped its head via an lcd screen. i liked that better than rolling a die because it helped to give the game a unique star wars feel that playing with a die just doesn't have. another problem is the price of the game - i've seen it everywhere from $45 to $60! even at the lowest msrp it's still a rip off. one of the biggest problems is one of the most obvious - if you're not a die-hard star wars fan you will not get very far in this game. my last and biggest complaint is with the questions themselves - like the original game they are horribly imbalanced. some questions are so simple a casual fan could answer them easily. some are so difficult even die-hards will have trouble with them. this brings me to my complaint about the dvd questions. not only are these questions really no more difficult than the card questions but as time ticks down the questions become easier! this makes it ridiculously easy for another player to steal the wedge if the question receiver is unable to answer. if i were designing the game i'd straighten up these flaws. but i'm not and overall i am very satisfied with it. edition notes: this game is a fairly recent release and it remains readily available at most major stores that sell board-style games and movie merchandise. if you want the game it shouldn't be too hard - just be ready to pay a fairly high price for it. overall: despite some minor issues this new version of star wars trivial pursuit is a leaps-and-bounds improvement over the original game. if you're a huge fan of the series who thinks your knowledge of the series is supreme don't hesitate to buy this game. there have been many star wars trivia games/books/etc. over the years but star wars trivial pursuit is the ultimate star wars trivia experience. no fan should pass this game up ",positive
" i like the language tutor and the music stuff! i also like the screen savers! it's given me great ideas! i play with it in a different way than you are supposed to. like if i need a story starter i go to the magic act and read the sentences for an idea ",positive
" our family loves this game and has played it for years. the tiles on this version are smaller than the original and some might find them difficult to handle. if you like scrabble you will love this game! ",positive
" even better than scrabble you build words on the board and build words up by adding letters over existing words. so tree becomes free and braces becomes blades. the scoring might be a little too easy but if you're hard core you can use the point values from scrabble to raise the score difficulty. the board is small so you have to start thinking up instead of out fairly soon into the game and the game doesn't drag on for too long. it is addictive and you will not look at words the same way again. ",positive
" my daughter (age 13) really enjoyed this game. it provides more options than scrabble which sometimes frustrates her because her mom and dad are better at that. ",positive
" it's soo cute and cuddly! not only is extra soft it's small enough to fit in your palm or make a great addition to a desk. it looks realistic too it had the little cat fur covering its eyes making it even more adorable the only downside if you trying cuddling with it to go to sleep make sure you take out the ty tag otherwise you would end up with heart shape marks on your face= ",positive
" this game is awesome! it is addictive though so be prepared. a little complicated once you get started but becomes easier. best if someone already knows the game to teach it. really fun though ",positive
" i definitely can tell when a great game show can be fun as a board game. unfortunately that absolutely isn't always the case. one of my all time favorite quiz shows back in the 80's was super password with bert convy. the game of course showcases a celebrity and a regular contestant trying to guess their way to guess a mystery word for a puzzle. this edition doesn't reflect on that edition. this board game edition is a example of the original password with the late allen ludden. the game is still fun and enjoyable for those who actually haven't seen the original password like myself but it is just delightful. unfortunately it isn't much fun reflecting on this version and relating to the bert convy edition. hopefully when password is remade it will be just like the themed 80's edition of the nbc game show. price: b- game: c 1/2+ fun & enjoyment: b- overall: c ",positive

" i bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased. it is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all. the corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on. it will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with. the price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products.

" i bought this set for my grandsons 2nd birthday. my son found it very easy to assemble and my daughter in law loves it because it is a lovely piece of furniture. my grandson loves to sit at the table and look at books or build with blocks. this is a sturdy set that will last for many years ",positive
" i love melissa and doug toys they're always well-made and always thoughtful. they encourage learning and their pieces made of natural material not only hold up well but are environmentally friendly. this game is a particularly nice example. it's a classic wooden puzzle with a twist. each vehicle puzzle piece has a magnet on it and the players yank them out with a magnetic tow truck. melissa and doug have made two other puzzles similar to this a fish puzzle and a butterfly puzzle with the same concept. this one however might appeal more to kids whose current fascinations lie more along the lines of cars and trucks. one of our pieces (on the fishing version of this puzzle) did stick but a quick rub around the edges with some sandpaper loosened it right up. the downside of using real materials is that wood does have a tendency to warp in humidity or dryness. that's a downside i'm willing to live with! excellent toy! ",positive
" i can't believe how well made this set is. i have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my daughter for christmas. i wanted something sturdy and not plastic. i just received my order today and these items are great! my son opened the box and tested them for his little sister and he can't wait to play with them with her. i ordered this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood and are extremely durable. i am very impressed and wish amazon carried the matching coffee pot and blender! i also had a problem with the velcro on the butter. it was an easy fix with some super glue. i think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come off ",positive

" if you are a hardcore family guy fan like me (i am actually one of the few people that watched family guy when it was originally on the air) you will not be disappointed with this monopoly version. the box is beautifully designed with the griffin family pictured on center and some easter eggs to look around for. the board is not the most impressive one especially compared to the simpson's and muppets monopoly versions but it is pretty nice with the griffins at center. what you will love of the board is the properties which include everything from chris' closet and seamus' lighthouse to james woods high and geronimo's palace to the clam and channel 5 news to mayor west's mansion and finally petoria all from both old and new seasons plus some scenes from the stewie's untold story movie. the property deeds are somewhat disappointing though. the do not have color watermarks like those found in the simpson's version but i guess they will do. peter's fishing boat hinden-peter peter-copter and the pope mobile replace the railroads. i bet you will not be laughing too much when you have to pay $200.00 (income tax) for volcano insurance or $75.00 for workplace sensitivity training (luxury tax) but hey you can't stay mad for long at the salesman guy right? it would have been cool to have joe swanson on the go to jail space and have a picture of quahog prison on the jail space but well what can you do? the pewter tokens are nice. you can chose from tv junkie peter mug in hand brian nose picking chris lois stewie in a high chair and meg (who looks like a peanut character). you can also order four more tokens that include the giant chicken quagmire joe and the evil monkey. the coolest changes are the chance and community chest cards that are replaced by the what the deuce! and giggity! giggity! giggity! cards respectively. they are beautifully done in full color and you will find things like; made sheriff of bumblescum advance to go get liposuction and implants pay $100 confederate civil war veterans are after you go back 3 spaces take big fat paulie to the movies as a favor collect $25.00 help death get a girlfriend collect $100 and many more. the money goes as follows $1 - meg $5 - chris $10 - lois $20 - brian $50 - stewie $100 - peter $500 - the griffins there are no special rules for this version which is weird since it has been the norm for some time in these special monopoly versions. to wrap it up i must say that even though they could have done a better job this is a beautiful and wonderfully done monopoly game. family guy fans will love it making this a great gift. have fun ",positive

" the build a figure (baf) program of marvel legends keeps on rocking. this time build a giant 14 apocalypse. this baf is big and cool super articulated with sculpt and paint fine enough to be a sculpture. for apocalypse 5 stars. for iron fist... well he's super articulated and does come with the mighty booty (that's the buttocks) of apocalypse but really is the weakest figure in this series. a lot of that is just charater design though. green tights with an open v-neck green shirt and what is that tattoo supposed to be anyway ballet slippers and a dew-rag? pretty horrible looking. if you can try to find the red suit variant at least that's a little cool. also the accesories (besides the booty) are two rubbery flames to fit into his hands to give a fire fist effect. good luck with that. they are kind of flimsy and hard to place in the hands. once you get them in you better not touch the figure again or they will fall off. overall not the quatlity of figure or accesories i'd expect. but the rest of the figures in the series will make up for this one plus you do still get that booty ",positive
" we received this for my daughter's 4th birthday. it has been a lot of fun to play--simple enough for her to play and hard enough to grow with her for the past year. although it has a lot of pieces they have remained durable and have withstood tiny fingers. ",positive
" my daughter received this for her 5th birthday and she absolutely loves it. it combines the classic board and memory games together. the pieces are made of very thick cardboard and are very durable. the only small complaint is the spinner which tends to get stuck easily. we have played this game multiple times each day since received and she is still excited everytime we open the box. an excellent game!!

" my 8 year old son loves this toy. he has spent many hours acting out the cartoon and loves that fact that the cape pops out at the push of a button and winds back in by moving a leg back and forth. he likes the food dish that shoots the disc. and also thinks the cryptonite is cool!!! it says it changes colors when warm but we havent seen that. maybe nn to run it under hot/cold water?! overall a fantastic buy ",positive

" my 3 1/2 year old son has older sisters with ipods and always wants to use them to listen to. we bought this for him for christmas and he calls it his ipod and he absolutely loves it. we download new songs and stories from time to time as a reward. we also bought the speakers for him to listen to stories or songs while going to sleep or just hanging out at home. it's tough and durable and withstands being dropped and rough handling like a 3 year old dips out ",positive
" i got this for my 6 year old son with moderate autism. what a god-send! he uses it every day for several hours. i bought the speaker accessory so he doesn't have to use the head phones all the time. it is so easy to change the song list. he is able to use it independently except for pushing the song vs. story button. the icons and ability to customize the icons have made it so he can quickly search for what he wants. i found the drawing screen for the icons challenging at first- but even me with my lack of artistic talent was able to accomplish the task so he knows them. i would give this my highest recommendation- very tough player- dropped who knows how many times- yet keeps going. the best thing i've purchased for him in a very long time. well worth the money. ",positive
" it is an okay seat. my only complaint is that my son has slightly chubby legs and the area on the chair where his legs go and the whole pummel thing seem kind of tight and uncomfortable for him. we started him in it at about 4 months. he sits in it for only short periods of time he gets uncomfortable pretty fast. otherwise a decent chair ",positive
" i'll start off by saying that this is the company to buy naruto headbands from. it is high quality fabric that is very comfortable on the skin and the length will fit around anyone's head (trust me i have a pretty big head). the insignia plate is made out of real metal and is engraved superbly. a velcro padding on the back ensures that the plate doesn't touch your forehead and cause discomfort. in other words this headband is like it was plucked out of the show itself and for the price it is a very nice addition to any naruto fan's wardrobe ",positive
" i got this for my 3 year old niece. she loves it and requests that it go with her all the time. the box to hold all the pieces is handy the magnets are easy and there's lots of variations of outfits. having 2 dolls makes it easy for friends parents etc to play along and interact. the only cons i see is that the box with all the pieces is a bit heavy it could use a handle. and the magnets are strong but sometimes the pieces slip a bit. all in all a great gift and toy!

" my 3 year old daughter has this dress up set and it is great for little hands that are not coordinated enough yet to dress and undress actual barbi dolls. she loves changing their outfits and switching their accessories - and i love that she can do this without any frustration. mellissa and doug toys are made with the quality of older toys - they are well constructed and made to last - and the sturdy box allows for easy clean up and storage.

" it is a little smaller than i expected...but i guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and took a tape measure in the room before hand. other than that it's perfect. my son's room has an atlanta braves theme so the colors are perfect. the main reason i bought this was to use as a toy box. so far it's worked out great! i don't have or plan to put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small don't bother me. the only thing i have sitting on top is a teddy bear and a piggy bank.

" i bought four of these for my husabnd son in law daughter and myself for christmas. i wrapped a bag of marshmallows for each of them and gave them the wrapped guns and marshmallows on christmas eve. the second they opened the marshmallows they knew what was in the box. they ripped into them and were shooting each other like crazy. they had a blast! i will tell you that the marshmallows do hurt at close range when the gun is pumped way up. my dogs loved it too. they ate all the marshmallows that fell to the floor. well not all of them..i did find some in the christmas tree and on the bookshelves. (yes they played with them in the house.) one trick...to get the marshmallows to shoot really well we genlty rolled them in our hands from side to side to make the mallow just a bit skinnier. stale marshmallows work great too ",positive
" ms. pac man was always my game back in the day. she just seemed less clunky than her male predecessor. i just received this game in the mail today and after a mad scramble for eight (count 'em eight) aa batteries i got down to business. i admit that i bought this game for ms. pac man exclusively. here's what i found in a nutshell: pros: 1) graphics & sound are faithful to the old arcade game with the minor exception of the placement of the score lives and fruit. no problem. 2) old skool joystick. nice touch. 3) plug 'n play set-up. no brainer. cons: 1) i honestly don't mind cords one bit. the eight batteries can be a bit of a logistical problem as i don't usually have a dozen-or-so batteries lying around at any given time. 2) my main gripe is that the joystick is frustratingly unresponsive and has the habit of moving ms. pac in directions i don't want her to go. i understand however that the previous version of this game was worse in this regard and has been slightly improved in this version. fair 'nuff. all-in-all a neat little contraption that is every bit as addictive as it was in my youth.

" i bought this toy for my 3 year old son before his baby brother was to be born. he absolutely loves this doll! i babysit during the day and he took care of his baby right along with me while i cared for the baby i keep. he had regressed and started wetting his pants again when i began babysitting but is now going to the bathroom on his own again after getting this doll and having his own baby to care for! the yawn as some other reviewers have said does sound a bit weird but it is only a doll! if the baby is not attended to properly to make her stop fussing or to put her to sleep then she'll eventually just do it on her own so it's not frustrating for my son great for younger kids. my husband did not want our son having a girl doll and i can't find any clothes to fit the doll to turn it into a boy so my only wish is that this doll was also made as a boy or at least boy clothes were sold for her.

" i purchased the 12-prank kit for my 83 year old aunt this past christmas. on christmas morning as everyone opened the usual boring gifts of knit sweaters and scented candles my elderly aunt carefully tore open her prank kit. it was an instant hit! as she laid out her fake dog poop on the floor next to the christmas tree and blew her new fart whistle everyone started to roll with laughter. oddly enough this inexpensive little gift became the high-point of our family christmas gift-giving. maybe that sounds pathetic but my aunt was carried back to younger days when she used to pull pranks with whoopie cushions on her little nephews. thanks to this great little package we all laughed so hard it hurt. what an awesome gift ",positive

" both of my kids got these for christmas - great idea; not as expensive as a dvd player for the car (especially for those of us who don't want the portable one/plan to get next vehicle with built in) and the picture was really better than i thought it would be. however i only got my children two discs a piece to start. now no discs worthwhile can be found anywhere. the only ones that are ever on the racks/online en masse are the star wars 3 pack (none of today's kids really want that) the tony hawk skate park (obviously they aren't interested there either) and fear factor (let's face it if you let your kids watch ff you need to take the videonow player and hit yourself in the head - hard).and even if i do find a couple on ebay the selection is so limited. i wish i'd just bought a cheap portable dvd player. hasbro really missed the boat on this one - it could have been a great thing but they didn't make enough discs of the ones they do produce and need to put more shows out for the kids. my advice: don't buy it. i am very disappointed in the disc selection - this is already at the bottom of the toy box.

" the x-23 figure availible on amazon.com is dressed in purple but there also is a black one - a variant that is alot harder to find [i resorted to ebay for mine]. the build of the figure is great - there's so much articulation it's insane; and her feet claws actually tuck under her shoes so they can be concealed which is beyond cool. the articulation for the most part is great. my only qualm with it is it makes her arms look funny but i can deal with that. she's barely 6 inches tall i don't expect her to be perfect. however the reason i'm giving her three stars is because i feel the purple outfitted one is far inferior to the black outfitted x. i recieved my black clad x-23 first and expected the same figure but in a purple for my other one but i was wrong. the black x-23 has very dark brown hair that lays straight and lank while the purple x-23's hair is jet black and windblown which makes her head almost impossible to move around. also the thing that bothers me the most is that x's eyes are green on the black suited version but on the purple suited version they're orange. i am a big x-23 fan and i understand that when she's triggered her eyes go crazy reddish orange but that's not something i really want to see sitting on top of my computer monitor. it's kind of creepy! and on a sidenote when did x-23 wear purple? in her comics she was either in black dressed as a civilain or in the old wolverine costume [which you can see in the comic that comes with x-23]. i would've prefered a variant wearing the wolverine costume while the black x-23 was mass produced. so personally i would recommend hunting down the variant of x-23 for your collection. she looks nicer and i think is more true to the character ",positive
