" slim jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. that's what helps the flavor. i can't figure out why anyone would like these as i can't seem to chew them to a point where i feel comfortable to swallow. it's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat. the amount of fat cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky. i'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff. at least i can chew the beef jerky ",negative

" i really enjoy organic foods so when i came upon this item i was thrilled they were making organic popcorn- especially newman's own a brand i've liked in the past. i have to agree with the other poster the flavor is bland and almost flavorless. there are other brands of organic popcorn that i've found more recently that are far better. don't waste your money on so many of them!!

" call me a traditionalist but i prefer the original jam-filled pop tarts with none of the overly sweet frosting on top. as a child i liked it right out of the toaster and would take it with me on the way to school. this portable variation seems to me like a misstep from the outset. the moment i ripped open the flimsy packaging the go-tart bar crumbled out of my hand and onto the floor. apparently the manufacturers at kellogg's decided to use the same bread-like consistency they use for their standard pop-tarts on this bar. especially with the shipping aspect introduced by amazon i think this is a mistake since i assume the whole idea behind this iteration of the snack is the portability aspect. on top of the bar is the same execrable sprinkle-laden white frosting i avoided once it was introduced as an enhancement so many years ago. without the ability of toasting the bar i find little point to the frosting except as a purposeless sugar-rush. consequently i cannot agree with its description as a ready-to-eat bar. one bar a little over an ounce is 140 calories thirty of which are fat. even though there are more fattening bars you could eat it still has an excessive-sounding 140 mg of sodium. i only tried the frosted strawberry variation because it was part of a free promotional package i received from amazon to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. i think i'll just stick with a granola bar if i get the kind of munchies this bar is targeted to satisfy ",negative
" because of tummy troubles my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet. well this stuff is just what the doctor ordered as it is almost completely tasteless. i can't give it a one star which qualifies as hating it as i can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients but it is not good. it makes kraft mac and cheese seem very exciting! i would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from annie's. this would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it ",negative
" the balls were squeezed into the box and flattened. the taste is not very peanutty. i'm disappointed ",negative
" i bought both the ahi tuna jerky and salmon jerky. both were dried out and brittle. absolutely the worst. incredibly the salmon jerky was worse (i.e. drier harder) than the ahi tuna jerky ",negative
" most of the strip were either hard and brittle or so tough they could barely be chewed. they put no expiration date on the bags so i don't even know if i was given old product or they allowed the salmon to leave the processing plant this way. on top of this they were too spicy. my dog seemed to enjoy it though. the ahi tuna on the other hand was great ",negative
" this salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough it is pretty much inedible. and when you do painstakingly gnaw on it it doesn't release much flavor but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth. i had the misfortune of ordering this and 7 of the 8 bags are still untouched and i'm not sure what to do with them. i even tried soaking the jerky and tried boiling it with some macaroni and nothing seems to soften this stuff up! what a waste of money. go for some beef jerky instead and if you need salmon eat it fresh or canned. this product is a joke ",negative
" melitta coffee is certainly one of the better brands and i really like that each pod is individually wrapped. i bought this because the senseo hazelnut was not in stock at the time. caution senseo coffee maker users: the melitta pod does not fit well in the senseo pod holders. the single pod holder is too small for the melitta pod and the double pod holder is too big for one melitta pod too small for two melitta pods. i found the coffee to be just a bit on the weak side but this may only be because i used it in a senseo machine. ",negative
" maybe i'm daft but i can't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine. i've tried tamping them which doesn't work well and i've tried just placing them in the filter. in both cases i get watery dribble but no espresso. as with other european products (think ikea) there are no printed instructions in english just line art drawings. perhaps i'm just doing something wrong. i like the concept of pods but i'll stick to beans instead ",negative
" i was very disappointed in the taste of this item. not at all what i expected from splenda. it is much too overpowering strong and when added to your beverage that is all you can taste. for instance if added to coffee you will not detect any coffee flavor only the splenda flavor. much too strong. i prefer the subtle taste of the other coffee additives over this splenda product - without question!

" we've enjoyed these cookies for months as they were available for purchase at our local costco warehouse. just purchased them in bulk here at amazon and were terribly disappointed to find that they arrived hard as rocks and stuck together. they don't expire until july 2007 so we're guessing that something happened to them in storage? we opened several packages and they're all the same. the reason i am even taking the time to write this review is to say that amazon's online policy states that grocery and gourmet foods are not returnable. are you kidding? i have a case of $30 cookies that are simply not fit for prime time snacking. i've e-mailed customer service regarding my delivery. it's doubtful i'll order grocery items again as i assumed the return policy for defective goods would be the same. just not worth the hassle. update: amazon shipped us a replacement order. unfortunately again all twelve packages are hard. each package has three rows of cookies each row is stuck together and each cookie must be pried from the next. actually it's a mute point doing this as the cookies are simply inedible as they are hard hard hard. the date on the package is: 11 jul 07 x i suggest a problem exists with this batch either from storage or from the manufacturer.

" taste great but the cap on the bottle doesn't seal very well so when it is shipped they leak. you can not take it with you without putting it in another container ",negative
" really strange cardboard mushy texture. flavor can be sickening at times but you get used to it. i won't buy this again. i am not sure this is even beef has a strange taste. not sure where the other reviews came from?? ",negative
" ...who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange. i love beef jerky especially peppered and hot & spicy varieties. but this jerky lacks the chewy-ness that i expect in a quality beef jerky. this stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy grainy consistency. the flavor isn't bad but after reluctantly finishing the first bag i can't bring myself to open the second one. perhaps i wasn't paying proper attention but i was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in brazil. i would not have purchased it if i had known this ",negative
" although this is a good coffee i was expecting something that tasted like a cappuccino. this coffee tastes nothing like it it doesn't even have a hint of cinnimon flavor as the package suggests. if you want regular coffee then this is the coffee to buy but if you're looking for cappuccino save your money ",negative
" i was excited to try this product as i love oreos but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. we tried newman-o's originals...my wife went first and the look on her face said it all. still i had to see for myself. we both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as oreo cookies. for some reason others seem to think they taste great. just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large.. ",negative
" i picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that pirate's booty was a great product. these tasted rather odd to me and i wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible. puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just don't go well together in my opinion. it might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste but that was not the case here ",negative
" after searching high and low i found a site for 'nossa familia coffee' that carries a coffee that is imported directly from a farm in brazil! i guess this family has won the cup of excellence competition and they put their top coffees in the senseo compatible pods. the site is www familyroast com and i highly recommend i ",negative
" this mix was very sour and because of the way the fruits are dried there were a lot of crumbs inside the packets ",negative
" i am really disappointed in this beand as they are marketing this to kids. 4% iron and no other vitamins?? with childhood obesity at epidemic proportions why would anyone feed their children all of these empty calories?? it is like giving them coke or pepsi for breakfast!! ok organic coke but still coke!! i am sad because i have heard great things about this brand and really like what they are doing for endangered species!! but they are not thinking about their target consumer children ",negative
" i want to let you know that i received my order in today's mail im unhappy to say this but the taste of this coffee is terrible i would have been better off if i had thrown my 37.00 out my car window. these coffee selections should be pulled off from your web site. i know you guys can not refund my money on this order but i am going to write to the products manufactorer and let them know how i feel about their coffee products. the taste of the coffee makes you sick to your stomach. if i were you i would post this commit under your customer's reveiws to let other buyers beware of this terrible tasting coffee ",negative
" then this isn't for you. horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that i definately don't care for...not to say that you will not however. if you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee this isn't the one to try ",negative
" i bought these pods on amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store. now i know why. when i opened the package the senseo watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee. buyer beware i am back to buying pods at the grocery store. ",negative
" be cautioned when ordering this product. what happened was i ordered this product a month ago and was sent the flatbread version instead of the clear tub of bite-size version. i called amazon explained my problem they promised to fix it by sending me a replacement. well the replacement came last week and it was still the flatbread. i'm not going to bother to call amazon again because i know it will just result in them sending me the flatbread once again. the flatbread itself was tasty and crunchy. i think the seeds really helped to put more complexity into the flavor. you can eat just the flatbread as snacks or maybe put a bit peanut butter or jam on top. it tastes very different than wheat and i like the taste of spelt quite a bit. so please be prepared to receive the flatbread version when you order. you may as well just order the flatbread version to start with and save yourself couple of bucks as well as having to call amazon to straighten things out ",negative
" these cookies were ok just ok. i may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies every last cookies was broken. i understand this is probably due to poor packaging. the consistency was a bit grainy and dry though. and milk did not help. next time i'll purchase a chewy brand or mrs. fields ",negative
" i received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas. the chest is beatiful and will be great for future use; however i am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea. although the bags are highly aromatic the tea is very bland as if the bags were old. i am sure bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty just not the box i received.

" i had trouble getting the cups to function properly without getting grounds in my coffee. at first i thought it was my coffee maker but the other brand of coffee i use worked fine. sometimes it took 3-4 cup changes to finally find a cup that would work correctly without getting grounds in my coffee. most of the time i would just give up. again the other brand of coffee i use never does this. not getting this coffee anymore - i would comment on the taste but i never got to really taste it with the grounds and all. donna - marylan ",negative
" i've tried this coffee with all size settings. it is too weak for my taste even at the smallest brew size. and if it was stronger i still don't think i would care for the flavor. it just doesn't taste like good colombian coffees that i've had not even close. this is definitely one i would not purchase again ",negative
" this is very weak coffee. do not buy unless you like it that way ",negative
" i thought this product had reasonably good taste but i have two major issues with it. first they describe this as a kettle corn. it is not kettle corn - not even close. this is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating. real kettle corn is a slightly sweet slightly salty popcorn. second each very small bag has 1.5 servings in it. when was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate 2/3's of it? they purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier. the whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion. remember when a can of coke had 1.5 servings in it? the fda made them change the label. if you eat the whole bag you are eating 200 calories of popcorn. no better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies so this is not a lesser evil - it's just the same old junk food with a new name. i won't buy this product again. it's the same stuff you can get anywhere ",negative
" after extensive research on grains and nutrition our family added amaranth to our staple diet. there's not a wide range of suppliers for amaranth and we started purchasing bob's red mill amaranth. well to be honest our experience with this product is that it's been of pretty poor quality. out of 8 packages we've bought so far we've had to return 3 to the outlet we purchased them from due to the amaranth being mouldy. and i mean open the package and you can smell that it's off right away mouldy. in addition one of the packages didn't smell mouldy but after we'd cooked it and added it to the baby food we were making the mouldy smell of the cooked amaranth was very noticeable. not good particularly as we're using the amaranth for making baby food for our toddler and mouldy grain is not really something you want to include in the ankle-biter's diet. in addition we found we have to hand pick stones grit and dirt from each package very very carefully. seems that they are included as a bonus. (note that as the grain itself is very small the stones dirt and grit are very small too - but big enough to damage teeth if they slip through the cleaning process - particularly toddler teeth). this cleaning and sorting process involves a lot of work which we wouldn't mind so much if the amaranth was consistently good quality but it hasn't been. i have to say that while after our research we'd recommend inclusion of amaranth in anyone's diet bob's red mill amaranth grain is not a product we would recommend. if you have no choice but this be very careful about cleaning it and hand picking stone dirt & grit out before you use it and make sure you check very carefully for evidence of mould both before and after cooking. in addition i'd recommend checking with the retailer that they will refund you the purchase price if the product you bought is off. so far we've been sucessful in getting our money refunded (when we had the receipt - we didn't once and we didn't get the money back that time but that was the first time and after that we were poorer but wiser....

" great idea poorly executed with an extremely unappetizing presentation. this is from someone who makes flavored rice a few times a week. that being said this is the worst review i have ever given anywhere so bear with me. you know how sometimes the rice sticks to the bottom of the pan if you overcook and you have to boil it out and it turns oddly clear but covered in carbon water? yeah. like that. the rice came out sticky (not it the palatable uniform japanese steamed rice way) and was an almost alien kind of translucent brown that was nothing like the picture. nothing. if you look closely you might be able to tell it had once been rice. yes i followed the instructions. my husband who wanted to try having fresh rice at work described it as an abomination which was a relief to me because when it was cooking it stenched up the house with a horrifying yet familiar odor that when i put my finger on it smelled exactly exactly like onondaga lake in syracuse ny is the summer back when it was the most polluted lake in the world and people were warned never to eat the fish they caught (assuming there were any alive in there) and kids weren't allowed to wade in it. it smells like raw sewage dead fish rotting feathers and chicken soup. it was 45f out and i opened the window. sometimes you buy a case of something and it turns out to be something you don't care for maybe it has too much onion or whatever but you know someone else will like it. normally i donate these things to a needy family. i think in this case it would be cruel. i can't imagine anyone who has made rice on their own mistaking this for rice. do yourself a favor and just drop a boullion cube in a pot with your stovetop rice. that's what they're trying to do here and failing at miserably. i can't sell the rest on an auction site because i'm afraid that even if i am completely honest about the smell i will get a bad rating. the only thing i can think of to use them for is to smoke out people in the breakroom with the odor next april fool's day ",negative
" i opened one packet (which was quite large for a serving and shared it with 3 others in my office. we all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible. no one could continue eating it and i sent back 8 of the 9 packets. not edible in our humble opinion. sorry ",negative

" first of all the tea chest is disappointing to say the least. the chest is made of cheep compressed sawdust and then coated with a plastic like 'finish' which makes the box look like it was constructed from cardboard and plastic. the tea its self is alright sadly nothing special. this item arrived a good 6 weeks after it was ordered all of the tea packets were wrinkled and crushed and the box broke after i opened it a few dozen times. needles to say this product way disappointing all around.

" i was really looking forward to these pods based on the reviews. starbucks is good but i prefer bolder taste.... imagine my surprise when i ordered 2 boxes - both were expired! one expired back in 2005 for gosh sakes. i admit that amazon agreed to credit me for cost plus part of shipping but geez 2 years expired!!! i'm hoping to find local san diego area shoppe that carries pods so that i can try something different than starbucks ",negative

" my sister worked at starbucks so i used to get their unground espresso beans for free on occasion. i have a pump espresso machine but only a cheap blade grinder which should tell you that i'm only about mid-range on the coffee-snobbery scale. that said i prefer the starbucks espresso to this in spite of the drastic difference in price when i buy it retail. again though i'm not one of those people who examines this stuff overly much. i only know what i like the taste of. in fact i only drink it in lattes. 4 shot lattes but lattes none the less ",negative

" i was very disappointed in this product. i wanted to use them for snacks and pie crusts but they are too stale to use. they are not crunchy as advertised since moisture has definitely entered through the packaging. unfortunately amazon will not let me return them so i'm out $20. i was going to try some other products by this brand but now i will not ",negative

" when i think dark roast i think full bodied and dark. melitta pods are the worst i've tried. i've tried senseo pods too which are only mediocre. i did find the target brand archer farms pods to be the best. the french roast really does rival starbucks home brewed. its cheap too...3.99 for 18 pods. if you like a full bodied rich dark and strong cup of cofee don't do melitta. i found senseo and archer farms pods fit in my melitta pod brewer just fine ",negative

" go to trader joe's for real natural peanut butter at $1.69 per pound. yes you'll need to stir it and that might seem strange at first if you have grown up like we all did on commercial junk. that junk that they add which always contains heart clogging partially hydrogenated oils (read heart clogging) turns the nutritional value of your peanut butter to garbage. you might as just well eat a snickers bar if you're going to eat skippy or peter pan or jiffy or whatever. your local health food store may have a peanut butter grinder (and butter stock peanuts) which would be uber natural and fresh doubly delicious and cheaper. from the ada (american diabetes association): are some fats better than others? yes. monounsaturated fats are the healthiest for your body. nuts -- like almonds cashews hazelnuts and peanuts -- and avocados contain this type of fat. choose olive or canola oil for cooking. polyunsaturated fat is the next healthiest fat. this is found in corn oil safflower oil soybean oil and mayonnaise. use small amounts of foods that contain saturated fats like butter lard and meat fat bacon and shortening. there are lower-fat versions of foods that contain saturated fats like sour cream and cream cheese. a healthy diet includes less than 30% of calories from fat with less than 10% of these from saturated fat.

" i gave it one star for the concept. i'm a fan of dave's hot sauces. his combination of smoky barbeque flavors and straight heat always gets my saliva going. but this spray had disappointing heat. in fact there's nearly none that i could even discern. it also had poor flavor. it tastes like bad watery vinegar. so why buy the stuff if it doesn't taste good or get your endorphins pumping?? the oleo-resin from the habaneros which are supposed to give the spray heat like to come out of solution and pool up at the top of the bottle. so instead of a homogeneous red color you get a blood red color floating on top of a pale yellow color and you have to shake furiously to get the spray looking normal again. i called dave's about it and they told me that's typical behavior! i was excited about this sauce because i always wanted a way to evenly disperse sauce onto pizzas but all i got were over-priced spray bottles filled with something i really can't describe as edible. i'd fill it with another sauce but it'd probably just clog the nozzle. it's also intended for use as a natural pest repellant. dave's suggest spritzing some on your garden to keep the rabbits at bay. i've never tried so i wouldn't know if it works as claimed. i hope it does or there'd be no need for this product to exist at all ",negative
" i ordered both this and honey nut version. i wish i had paid more attention to the low fat part of this version. this version is hard and too cinnamon/sugary which seems to happen w/ some low-fat cereals. they compensate for the low fat by sugaring it up and end up w/ a hard less tasty and less filling product. however the honey nut version is very good. it has good crunch but is not too hard and has tasty almond slivers in it. it's sweet but not overly for granola and no cinnamon taste at all. i understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon and i typically like cinnamon but this version is too much and the raisins too dried out and hard. the package is very convenient though. i now have to mix in the regular version w/ this product to help me get rid of the low fat stuff. some label info: low fat w/ raisin (lf) has 180 calories per 1/2 cup while honey nut (hn) has only 20 more at 200. there are 12 1/2 cup servings in the hn while the lf only has 10. product weight is hn 24 oz and lf 20.5 oz. finally sugars are hn 11g while the lf has 15g ",negative

" do not be fooled by this sugar coated seemingly delectable pastry! i have been a long time fan of the original pop-tart and the go-tart just seemed like the natural progression of things so i went along with the newest technology in mass produced baked goods. the go-tart offers you a pop-tart on the go because everyone knows this is the 21st century and we are on the move. i'm venturing to guess that go-gurt was a success so why not make a go-tart? well there are a number of reasons. actually just one. you can already eat a pop tart on the go. it's too bad the go-tart ruined everything i loved about the pop-tart. the greatest hope i had for this flop of a product was that the frosting (or what you'd like to call that sugary stuff on the top) would reach the corners of the tart unlike the original pop-tart. though the sugar covers the corners there is barely any frosting at all on this tart! it is but a thin line of the sugary goodness we would all expect from a normal pop-tart. the filling has a gooey consistency and worst of all the breading part crumbled in my hand. i had to eat my go-tart in pieces. this is clearly not on the go. this is worse than a pop-tart and is probably more fattening than one. save your money boycott the go-tart ",negative

" bear naked all natural granola (apple cinnamon) is a delicious and nutritious way to start or add a little treat to your day. as a breakfast cereal(it also is sold in larger 12 oz packages of 6) you'll be scraping the bottom of the bowl to get just that last little bit more. it's sweet enough so you do not have to add sugar. just use with low-fat milk soy or lactaid(another great product for those who are lactose intolerant) for a low-calorie high energy starter. nice chunk-size pieces that are both chewy and crunchy and don't get all soggy.you can really taste the apple-cinnamon in this one. the ingredients(which are bearly processed and utterly naked) are: whole grain oats(good carbs) wildflower honeyexpeller pressed canola oil walnuts(smart fats) apples coconut almonds oat bran crisp rice(rice an barley malt) natural flavors whole grain flax sesame seeds and cinnamon. there are 7 gr fat 1.5 sat. fat no trans fat no cholesterol no sodium 17gr carbs 3 grms dietary fiber 5 gr sugar(probably from the fruit and honey) and 3 gr protein. 140 total calories per serving(1/4 cup which i think is a little small for breakfast))of course that is before you add the milk so don't forget to add that in if you are counting calories. makes a great pick-me-up snack or dessert too! eat 'em right out of the bag. there are plenty of good size chunky bits. the only problem is that no matter how much you shake it up after the chunks are gone there is only crumbs which are hard to eat as a snack could get a little messy. but..you can always add those crumbs to a carton of yogurt or a topping for frozen yogurt for a little extra flavor. this 12 pack of 2 oz bags is a really good deal price wise compared to the grocery store. there are a good variety of different tastes and flavors.we also liked the banana nut quite a bit but found the peak protein package bland. i only wish that there was a variety pack for purchasing them in these bulk deals. click on the bear naked link to see other products. the package has a zip lock to maintain freshness and prevent spills. throw 'em in your car purse backpack or gym bag. remember to breathe eat healthy and enjoy....laurie ",positive

" this product is great! very refreshing. it tastes just like you are drinking it straight from a young coconut. it doesn't have any added sugar & it's only 60 calories a serving. i just wish it were cheaper... ",positive
" excellent. one of the few food items i've found on here that i think i'll buy again. remember that it's best chilled/ice cold if you're ever gonna sample it. not so good when not so cold great when actually cold. very refreshing feel either way though after you've had a drink ",positive
" zico coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut. if you never had coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12. some people may say it's an aquire taste but i think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised. i started drinking coconut water ever since i was a baby. it's very healthy and low in sugar. currently i give it to my [...] son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices ",positive

" bear naked is my favorite granola and fruit and nut is by far my favorite flavor. i came across bear naked because one of my favorite breakfast's is granola mixed with banana and yogurt. when i went off of refined sugar i was having the hardest time finding a granola without sugar added. bear naked uses all natural sugars like pear juice and maple syrup. my favorite part of this flavor is the dried cranberries and the coconut plus the almonds add crunch to an overall chewy texture. i recommend this brand to all lovers of granola and to anyone looking for a healthy treat ",positive
" bear naked granola is just fabulous. i've tried every granola around and bear naked strikes the right balance between crunchy sweet and ostensibly good for you. and amazon's price certainly beats what you'd pay at the store. ",positive
" good low sodium low sugar granola that i feel i can't afford at the onesie price in the traditional shopping venues ",positive
" i hesitate to write a review about a food because well one man's meat is another man's poison ... i like the not-too-sweet and minimally processed taste of this brand; the banana flavour is our favourite. the fruit and nut flavour lacks a little oomph and the fruit inside is too tangy for my taste buds (so maybe too minimally processed?). also remember that 'all natural' is not organic even if you find this in the health food section of your grocery store. our local target also carries this brand of granola and has the best price for it ",positive
" i love granola and cereal in general but i have to say that this is the very best granola i have ever had. the people at bear naked have a philosophy that i love and which is on the back of every bag: we believe food should be hand-made from wholesome and natural ingredients you can actually pronounce. although i do eat processed food i appreciate the appeal of the more traditionally prepared foods and this granola tops the list for nutrition and taste. like most granola it is high in calories and fat but take note that the fat comes largely from the nuts contained (it also contains expeller pressed canola oil) and it has no trans fat and only 1.5g of saturated fat per serving. this cereal is softer than most granola though not soft enough for me to consider it chewy. it does have large chunks of nuts and also contains cranberries and flax seed for optimal nutritional and digestive health. the six-pack sold on amazon makes the price per package reasonable (the ingredients are quite expensive) so as a value proposition i think this is not only a great product but a great buy. delicious and nutritious: a great combination that i recommend highly ",positive
" we love this granola! bear naked makes wonderfully nutritious and delicious granola. we love eating the banana flavor by the handfuls and the peak protein flavor mixed in with our yogurt. amazon sells it for a great price too ",positive
" this is the second time i've bought these for my dog. although they are not dog treats my dog loves them. she is very special to me so i get her the best. this is a great price for these slim jims. if i buy them in the store i pay alot more for them. i've tried them also & their very good. they come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time. just like the ones they sell in the stores. if you buy them one at a time at .25c a piece you pay $25.00 dollars for them. i think this is a great value!

" i've been wanting to try spirulina the superfood that everyone in the health world swears by and figured this would be as good an opportunity as any to do so. the bar is a medium sized green rectangle. it smells interesting and is very moist and chewy. i'm not a big fan of sour foods so i didn't like that it tasted a bit sour. my [...] brother however loved this bar more than all the others we tried. has a lot of cashew and is very sweet and packed with good fats. very filling! overall if you like sour and sweet this bar is for you ",positive
" this granola is great-tasting and healthy. other brands of granola have unhealthy oils in them but this granola does not. apple blueberry is my family's favorite flavor ",positive

" i have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat. this led to me shopping in health food stores/whole foods for anything in the cracker/cookie/snack category. i once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3-4 supermarkets and couldn't find any so i went to whole foods near my job. i saw these crackers and bought the cheddar flavor and loved them. i have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors. who doesn't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies?

" these are just delicious--and i like having the controlled portions in the bags--a very satisfying snack for 150 calories ",positive
" i have enjoyed goldfish and other cheese-based snack crackers since i was a child but no more. i tried these cheddar bunnies as i have enjoyed other products by annie's and have now found my all-time favorite snack cracker. from a nutritional standpoint they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors and are made from organic ingredients including real wisconsin cheddar cheese. the packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food and the price is comparable to other non-organic products. i am completely satisfied with these crackers: the are a good value they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors (although they really don't qualify as health food of course) they taste fantastic and last but not least they're fun ",positive
" these cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house. better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers these are a good snack to give to your kids or eat yourself. i was very pleased with this purchase ",positive
" bear naked all natural granola (apple cinnamon) is a delicious and nutritious way to start or add a little treat to your day. as a breakfast cereal(it also is sold in larger 12 oz packages of 6) you'll be scraping the bottom of the bowl to get just that last little bit more. it's sweet enough so you do not have to add sugar. just use with low-fat milk soy or lactaid(another great product for those who are lactose intolerant) for a low-calorie high energy starter. nice chunk-size pieces that are both chewy and crunchy and don't get all soggy.you can really taste the apple-cinnamon in this one. the ingredients(which are bearly processed and utterly naked) are: whole grain oats(good carbs) wildflower honeyexpeller pressed canola oil walnuts(smart fats) apples coconut almonds oat bran crisp rice(rice an barley malt) natural flavors whole grain flax sesame seeds and cinnamon. there are 7 gr fat 1.5 sat. fat no trans fat no cholesterol no sodium 17gr carbs 3 grms dietary fiber 5 gr sugar(probably from the fruit and honey) and 3 gr protein. 140 total calories per serving(1/4 cup which i think is a little small for breakfast))of course that is before you add the milk so don't forget to add that in if you are counting calories. makes a great pick-me-up snack or dessert too! eat 'em right out of the bag. there are plenty of good size chunky bits. the only problem is that no matter how much you shake it up after the chunks are gone there is only crumbs which are hard to eat as a snack could get a little messy. but..you can always add those crumbs to a carton of yogurt or a topping for frozen yogurt for a little extra flavor. this 12 pack of 2 oz bags is a really good deal price wise compared to the grocery store. there are a good variety of different tastes and flavors.we also liked the banana nut quite a bit but found the peak protein package bland. i only wish that there was a variety pack for purchasing them in these bulk deals. click on the bear naked link to see other products. the package has a zip lock to maintain freshness and prevent spills. throw 'em in your car purse backpack or gym bag. remember to breathe eat healthy and enjoy....laurie ",positive

" all 4 of mine love these. they are great for a quick snack on the go or to pack in lunches when in a hurry ",positive
" these crackers are an excellent quality snack food. the classic cracker is a crispy (ritz-like) buttery cracker with peanut butter inside as described. i bought a box at our local supermarket before committing to the 4 boxes and the kids & husband loved them! to save money i bought them on amazon. each packet has 4 cracker sandwiches in them so if you are like me you'd like to know that your kids will eat the entire package! most of the other brands have 6 in a pkg so sometimes kids will toss what they can't finish during lunchtime. the cost is about 0.62 each and convenient. i also purchased back to nature mini classic creme grab & go and they are 0.52 each pkg. we eat organic and (natural also) and the food lookslike other kids at school but without the chemicals gmo's and hydrogenated fats...yuk!eat healthy in 2007 ",positive
" these crackers are great for the natural health-conscious family as well as anyone else who loves goldfish or other cheese crackers... they taste great and are all natural with organic wheat. nothing weird - you can actually understand what every ingredient is! (how refreshing) plus i love this new big box -- 12 oz instead of regular 7.5 oz. not only does it save packaging and cabinet space but it's a better price per ounce! great for us because we go through them so fast. now that these are available here i also don't have to go to the store (some of my local stores don't carry the big size anyway). ",positive
" the only way i drink this stuff is mixed with a cup of coffee makes a very nice late afternoon treat without a ton calories! ",positive
" i love these crackers and was suprised to find them on amazon.com i first found them in reading pa and here in florida could not find them. high fiber is important to me and these have more than most. ",positive
" these are really expensive at the leading national overpriced healthy food supermarket and they are worth even the higher price. don't worry about buying too many with the six pack - i was a little concerned about that when i bought here a few months ago but my wife and i ate all of them easily. i'm not even the biggest fan of pumpkin seeds by themselves but in these euro-style flatbread crackers they add something really good to the flavor ",positive

" i'm a vegetarian and although my husband isn't he enjoys this soup just as much. the tofu in the mix creates a creamy texture. if you're expecting a potato au gratin flavor you will be disappointed... however if you've made homemade miso soup from scratch and like the taste this product makes an excellent time-saving substitute. the tofu serves a source of protein and the seaweed provides medicinal minerals. this soup is excellent to drink when sick and remarkably soothes a sour stomach. my local health food store charges $5.30 per box of 4 packets. amazon sells it for $2.66 a box. substantial savings ",positive

" for anyone who needs a shelf-stable quick lunch option this is the one! the soup is delicious and the prep couldn't be easier plus i love that you can prepare and eat it right in the bowl. i always make sure i have a few of these in my desk drawer at work so i never have an i forgot my lunch issue and the portion is big enough to actually constitute a full meal (for lunch anyway). i love the udon flavor and my husband swears by the miso ",positive
" authenic but a little bland for me. i add ponzu sauce to taste and make sure it gets really hot in the micriwave. if steaming when you take it out it tastes better. pre rinsing the noodles (as directed) is nonsense. just cover them with good clean water (i never use tap) stir in the sauce and toppings and nuke it about 90 seconds uncovered. stir and serve. it had everyone in my office drooling with questions! best price is on amazon just order 2 so you don't pay shipping. ",positive
" i've tried several of the annie chun flavors and i liked most of them but the kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious! this is the best packaged soup product of any kind that i have ever tried and i usually dislike canned or packaged soup products. this is even better than my favorite canned brunswick stew that i have loved for so long! it is moderately spicy but if you don't mind a bit if spice this one is just too good to pass up. i could practically live off of this stuff! thank you annie chun for making a packaged meal worth eating ",positive
" this annie chun's udon soup is very easy to prepare. i don't think the first step is necessary either. just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1/2 minutes. add the sauce packet. the noodles loosen up after you stir it. if you what a more filling soup add meat/vegetables. my kids and i really love this soup! i just purchased more from amazon because it's a better buy here than at the grocery store ",positive

" this sparkling juice really holds up to the description. it has the perfect amount of carbonation (not too much not too little) is crisp to the taste and is very refreshing. the 8 oz. cans sounded pretty weak but it turns out that one can is the perfect amount for a sitting. since first tasting martinelli's sparkling apple cider at a new year's celebration over a decade ago i've been a huge fan of carbonated apple drinks but none have been just right. naturally i've tasted the types that i've come across over the years including: martinelli's sparking cider (which is kind of sweet tasting and not generally bottled for everyday consumption) martinelli's sparkling apple juice (a bit under-carbonated) apple beer (non-alcoholic good but has a slightly odd taste) appletiser (uk only good but uk only) and a few other local organic brands. all of the aforementioned beverages are good on occasion but seriously... none compare to essn's sparkling fuji apple juice. yeah it is a little pricey but its worth it ",positive
" amazon grocery was fast and easy as usual and the mac & cheese is great we can't get our five year old to stop eating it...price wise its a fairly good deal in comparison to the grocery store.. ",positive
" these cheese sticks are irresistible. in fact for a substitute they taste far better than the original. my kids love them and 1 ounce pack fits perfectly into a lunchbox. ",positive
" check the company's website. they select & cook their tuna differently and that's what makes their tuna the best. it has the lowest possible mercury (same as salmon and much lower than regular tuna) plus they cook it only once after it's canned so all the healthy vitamins and omega-3 fatty acids are still there in the can! plus amazon has it for a great price ",positive
" this is just what i've been needing for a power lifting diet or optimal health in general. the flavor of the meat is not masked by salt. yet the aroma is not as overpouring as other brands. great stuff! four stars only because it is $3.75 per can. ",positive
" i bought this jerky at a xmas lot a couple of years ago and everyone raved about it. this year they were sold out but i was lucky to find it on amazon..even less expensive! this is the best you can find..the ones in the market to do not even compare. believe me...it does not last long in our house! would definetly recommend the original and other flavors...they are all great ",positive
" my packaged arrived much quicker than i had anticipated. since living in the midwest the last 5 yrs i've had limited access to beef jerky. i accidentally ran into 'oberto' beef jerky which was fine just extremely salty and overly seasoned. world kitchens beef jerky tasted very natural and delicious i purchased it based on reviews and cravings and i would definitely purchase again. superb beef quality texture and flavor. thank you ",positive
" i don't think that it is possible to get better beef jerky for the price. my wife and two kids also find it to be delicious ",positive
" ordered 2lbs based upon the positive reviews. i am happy with the quality of the jerky and taste of the product i will buy again. my kids love the stuff not a bad snack ",positive

" i've used this product for recipes such as chicken pot pie and shepherds pie. to get height i whip the batter in my stand mixer to ensure lots of air bubbles are trapped to support the mix as it cooks. they've turned out great and you can't tell it's gluten-free. i've had less luck making biscuits out of it -- came out hard -- but that seems to be a hazard in any gluten-free flour mix ",positive
" they were thick like bisquick biscuits. they tasted great. would be wonderful in chicken & dumplings... the only thing i did wrong when making them was using bob's red mill sall purpose gluten free flour to roll the biscuit dough in. it made the outside of our biscuits taste like raw beans... yuck! i used white rice flour and they tasted great ;) for a buttery flavor put butter (or if you are gfcf a non-casien containing margarine spread) on the top for a taste similar to kfc. taste great with jelly in the middle too. :) i froze the unbaked left-over biscuits and they turned out well 2 months later. : ",positive
" easy convenient and tasty snack or breakfast. particularly good for college students ",positive
" i take these to work along with little minature milks i pick up at the convenient store. they're quite filling and get me through to lunch just fine. and they're not too bad for you either. considering they're all the sugary cereals your mom complained about when you were a kid. in fact the one with the highest calorie count (280) is the rasin bran and that's something that would actually be considered healthy. all the rest fall into the 160-220 range ",positive
" my spouse is on south beach diet and loves these. i portion them out in ziplock bags( 15 nuts each) and they are grab and go. lots of protein some fat and very little carbs. fresh and tasty. ",positive

" i tried this coffee on a whim. my husband and i really enjoy our single serve coffee maker. we easily use up an 18-pak in 2 to 3 days between the grown children and us. this coffee has very smooth taste and mildly strong in flavor. it is a very nice coffee that can be enjoyed daily ",positive
" i like pop-tarts as does my family and i was thrilled to see go-tarts and even more thrilled when we tasted them. you do not need to put these little guys in the toaster; they are ready to dance about in your mouth without any heating and this is a good feature. i often look for little snacks that i can take with me on long or short trips. sometimes a nibble keeps mouths occupied and stress down just when you need a little quiet in the car; these are great for that or any other time you want a quick snack. i tasted the frosted strawberry and it is very good. give them a try great for a quick snack at home or on the go ",positive
" man these things are good. i used to eat pop-tarts all the time but it eventually got to the point that a) i got tired of pop-tarts and b) they seemingly just stopped making them like they used to. instead of being good and soft like they're supposed to be pop-tarts morphed into hard pastries that felt and tasted like they had been left out in the air for a couple of days. these new go-tarts at least the frosted strawberry ones are just right - soft pastries with just the right amount of strawberry inside them to give you that elusive strawberry twang taste (some of you may know what i'm talking about here). these things are ready to eat right out of the pack - so ready to eat in fact that there's a message on each package stating that you should not put them in a toaster or microwave. if you're the daredevil sort and insist on breaking kellogg's prescribed rules i can't stop you - but don't blame me if your microwave explodes or something. of course one little 1.2 oz. bar isn't enough for anyone bigger than a chihuahua puppy so volume is an important factor here which is where these multi-pack boxes come in so handy. with 140 calories per bar i don't guess these things will be making any of jenny craig's diet plans any time soon but i say life's too short - eat all you want. and with these individually wrapped bars you won't face the classic pop-tart dilemma of having to choose between eating two pastries now or putting one back in the box knowing that it will taste even more stale later because you've already freed it from its freshness-preserving little tinfoil wrapper thingy ",positive
" love bobs red mill organic golden flaxseed and will purchuse it again it is one of the best product on the market in my opinion. i use flaxseed every day i start my morning with a oatmeal flax seed muffen that i came up with i also use it in a lot of my recipies good product thanks bob's red mill ",positive
" i was going to just put this on my cereal in the morning. now i add it to my protein shake suppliments and i've started cooking with it by using it as a breading for fish chicken or pretty much anything. it's fantastic! i'm going to end up ordering more soon ",positive
" this is a great product. the golden flax is slightly better tasting than the brown. its good enough to put in muffins and (for us) toppings such as apple bake where you can taste it. we actually do consume enough to justify buying it buy the box. we also consume it in shakes but its best when baked- works great in cornbread too. we also get stone ground flours and cornmeals and these three make up a lot of value in this department. flax oil of course is very high in short chain omega 3's. fish oils are better but if you have the other nutrients and enzymes in your body you can make the long ones from the ones in flax- hence this product fulfills this need very well (flax is very concentrated in short chain 3's). did i mention it actually tastes great in baked goods? bob's red mill is a quality product ",positive
" i have tried to lose weight for a long l o n g time. also for a long l o n g time i have seen newpaper advertizements for this tea. it seemed ridiculous to me at first.... i mean lose weight by drinking tea? this idea had just about as much credibility to me as some of those sauna belts (which can help you lose weight for a full 24 hours....after which time it comes back again!) well last year i was getting pretty desperate. i had somehow managed to lose 40 pounds....by drinking only regular tea instant coffee and home-made lemonade and eating only bird's eye vegetables and turkey. (in fact i have invented the turkey diet! it's very simple: eat turkey fall asleep (from the tryptophan!).....and if you fall asleep you can't eat you see. a variation i guess on the hollywood diet which can be used only on weekends....because most people need to stay awake during the week to go to work!) anyway this diet worked for me....but it was pretty boring....took most of my free time away and....turkey is expernsive! i gradually stopped this diet and gradually got back 20 of those 40 pounds. i looked desperately for another way to lose weight....but drinking tea to do it just didn't logical.... however no other method presented itself that was as inexpensive as drinking tea....and after all that expensive (but delicious!) turkey it seemd a good way to go. now this particular tea itself is quite expensive -- $43 for 4 ounces (on sale....ouch!)....but the 4 ounces of lose tea would make at least 60 6 ounce cups (360 ounces...and i'd of course be adding my own water and sweetener)....so i figured why not? (well...because of the possible bad taste that's why not. i've tried herbal teas in the past and -- with the delicious exception of jasmine tea -- thoroughly disliked each one.) but even so i decided to risk it...i've tasted far worse things than herbal tea after all.... so about a year ago i sent away for it. when the wu-long tea arrived (in a lovely little transparent green plastic bag lined with aluminum foil giving the impression of a crushed green diamond) i made it and drank it. hmmm (or rather mmmm!) not bad tasting at all! it tasted like the best black tea...the kind (other than jasmine) that i like the best. butas the tea was so expensive i decided not to drink it too often.... as the owner of a healthy refrigerator (one loaded with vitamins which i take only in emergencies because i can't afford to keep buying them) i now had this healthy tea which i put in the refrigerator to keep it fresh) to sort of keep the vitamins company! i did throughly read the literature that came with the tea however....and noticed that many people had praised the medicinal qualities of this tea along with it's weight-loss abilities. hmmm.... i decided that i had happily gotten more than i bargained for....a weight-loss tea and one which helpoed with other health problems. nice to get such a bargain -- but at $43 for 4 ounces of lose tea it was still quite expensive. and so after that first cup i restrained myself from drinking it for quite some time..... actually i didn't drink another cup until about two weeks ago! i was beginning to feel as if the minor cut i had gotten the week before had somehow let an infection in (though the cut itself didn't look infected.) anyway i was beginning to feel very very very w....e....a...k..... two years ago in fact i was hospitalized with an infection....the very same infection that killed my mother the month before! my mother in the hospital had said that she felt like a vegetable and having gotten the same infection i knew how accurate that description really was: i was so weak then in fact i had had trouble raising my arms above my head! and now i felt it was starting to happen again! my first thought was to call 911. but my second thought was strangely concentrated on those glowing testimonials i had read from other customers who had used wu-long tea. i figured i'd try to make myself a cup....if the tea didn't work i could always call 911.... after all though i felt very weak i didn't feel totally paralzyed....yet anyway. but i knew i had to make and drink that tea fast.....before total weakness engulfed me. did i feel up to doing so? yes....i f...took my time i f...i was very careful and...i f.. i stayed very near the telephone as i made the tea....just in case.... i managed to make myself the cup of tea....to wait for it to cool down a bit....and to drink it. within an hour the feeling of weakness had left me! and as of this writing....taking place a full two weeks later....the weakness (and presumably the infection) have not come back! (oh if only i had had the courage to buy this tea ..t w o.. years ago and give it to my wonderful mother!!!!!!) now i'm not saying this tea will work miracles for everyone and in every circumstance. the tea did not transform my looks to those of princess grace (whom i consider the most beautiful woman of all time) and have not cured me of a very slight case of myasthenia gravis...a neuro-muscular ailment which i have had since the age of four. i doubt very much that it has made me immortal and i know for a fact that it has not granted me super-powers or the ability to fly or to transcend time. (no one has ever accused me of not having a good imagination! : ) however upon drinking that tea my feelings of infection (a feeling of weakness quite different from that of myasthenia gravis) did go away! i don't remember what the other testimonals for this tea were....but i'm sure now that at least 98% of them are true! perhaps there is no real fountain of youth. but this tea...which seems to cure many ailments and most probably helps one lose weight as well if taken often enough seems a very close second. ponce de leon would have been happy with it i'm sure. i don't know if it will help everyone...but i do know it helped me (and probably the other people who gave testimonials too.) and that second cup of tea -- even the whole 4 ounces of lose tea -- are certainly less expensive than going to the hospital! for those on a budget like me wu-long tea is it seems destined to be used as a luxury and/or in an emergency. but i really feel it belongs in every home.....just like aspirin does. and -- for emergency use...please take the same precautions i did: 1) be sure you do have the energy to actually make and drink the tea and 2) be near a telephone so you can call 911 in case the tea doesn't work for you. the tea did work for me in the above circumstance anyway. an elixir of life? perhaps and perhaps not depending on the person and the circumstances. all i know is that for me and under the circumstances described above it certainly seems to have saved mine!

" for people with who need to eat something between meals to keep their blood sugar levels up these peanut butter balls are a godsend. many's the time i've felt the familiar lightheadness and oncoming headache from low blood sugar and been saved by these things. i always carry one in my pocket or purse and keep one in the glove compartment. ",positive
" this snack is superb in several ways. first it is very good tasting. the flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie. nutritionally it has quite a bit of protein very very low in simple carbohydrates (or sugars) and is high in fiber. i carry these with me to work and eat one in the morning and one in the afternoon to help me keep away from junk foods and excessive caffeine. these would be excellent to carry with you on a hiking trip ",positive

" wow - this beef jerky is so good it should come with a label: warning - highly addictive. hands-down the best beef jerky we've ever eaten. moist yet chewy very satisfying. not too salty. lots of flavor. think maybe i'll go eat some now... ",positive
" although i was a little put off by a prior review that indicated this product was nearly inedible we had purchased this salmon jerky at trader joe's in smaller packets and really liked it so we decided to purchase here at amazon much less expensively. yes this product is very dry but it also has none of the preservatives included in some of the more moist jerky products out there. my family liked it and we are placing a second order. that other reviewer should send her inedible seven extra packages our way ",positive
" serves well as an in-between meals snack. got a good deal on amazon ",positive
" even though i know it's important to eat breakfast i seldom do it; i'd rather sleep a little longer. these breakfast bars are a nice easy way to solve the problem. i keep a box in the car and munch on them on the way to work in the morning...they're whole grain nice and filling and taste good to boot. they're also a nice treat on the way home. the oats and honey are my favorite but the variety pack provides a nice change. all of the flavors are tasty: peanut butter cinnamon maple sugar - all yummy ",positive
" excellent green decaf tea at a great price. we love this tea. it has a strong delightful green tea taste and its decaf too. by comparison many other green teas are too dry tasting for me. and i like the convenience of the 40 tea bag size boxes as we drink a lot of this tea. its great hot and good iced too ",positive
" add mayonaise to anything and i love it. that is espcially true of this white albacore tuna. being packed in water lowers the calories and it's fat free but it needs something to moisten it.... like mayo. it's delicious and totally clear of any dark tuna meat if you abhor even the slightest amount of dark tuna meat in your salad. the tuna are supposedly wild caught in dolphin safe nets so are therefore hopefully lower in mercury content. plus there is nothing added to the product so it's truly all natural. i happen to like dark as well as white tuna but if you only like the white like so many of my family and friends then this is the brand to buy ",positive
" i love eating a lot of cereal in the morning. like anybody i really don't choose a cereal that is just good for you i really choose it for taste. i loved special k before when it was plain flakes but i absolutely love it even more with the addition of red strawberries. this cereal tastes even better with each morsel and bite with the addition of strawberries. i like how delightful the strawberries taste after i add the milk into the cereal. this is a great buy for anybody who loves special k cereal or for anyone who just hasn't considered that special challenge. price: b+ taste: a- overal: b ",positive
" i like sardines much to my wife's dismay. i can eat them right out of the can. however skinless and boneless they have to be and that is becoming an expensive variety. how nice it was then to find that amazon is selling the reese brand at very attractive prices. i've tried both the 3.75 and 4.375 oz cans in olive oil of course--purchase 30 or 40 cans at a time--and have been quite well pleased. i prefer the larger can. in my experience the 4.375 is packed with smaller sardines that tend to have a more delicate taste. at least that was my opinion respecting those that are netted and packed in morocco as most sardines that i have been buying are. that brings me to the single problem i encountered in a recent purchase of the 4.375 oz reese product. while the web page for it called it out as a product of morocco what arrived was a product of portugal. the box graphics as shown on the website was different too and the sardines were larger and firmer than those of morocco. although still tasteful and a great value too i prefer the moroccan variety. it's that more delicate taste that i seek. for most and for me as well the product source is certainly a minor point but i did call the issue to amazon's attention. amazon is great when it comes to feedback and actually seeks it but i do not know how my comments were ultimately dealt with. the website still shows the product as moroccan and package graphics different than the packaging that i received. of course the website includes info and pictures that reese provides. reese probably shipped the portuguese variety without advising amazon of the change. it could be that i will not know what is actually being shipped until i make my next purchase ",positive
" for a working mom these are the best. quick easy - heck my four -year-old can make them! price-wise? i'm a cheapskate and only bought these when they were on sale for $1 a bag. amazon offers them for less. the garlic cheddar biscuits btw are the closest things i've found to the red lobster cheddar bay biscuits...and so easy ",positive
" i did receive the splenda flavor packs and enjoy them alot. ",positive
" flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now but even if you buy the sugar-free kind you're ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer. as if that weren't bad enough it's partially hydrogenated! splenda flavor blends is a wonderful alternative if you're like me and just can't face black coffee. please note that this is not a creamer. it sweetens/flavors coffee. if you find you just have to have creamer to tame down your coffee you can add a splenda flavor blend and a splash of skim milk or if you like things more creamy buy some powdered non-fat milk and add that along with the splenda flavor blends. lots of times i find products with splenda already in them to be too sweet but i didn't think that was the case with this. all three of the available flavors (hazelnut mocha vanilla) taste great without being overpowering. finally now i can kick that fatty creamer bad habit! ",positive
" finally a flavored sugar! splenda is awesome (does not create sugar imbalance in your body which is the #1 weight gainer)! the mocha is absolutely the best of the three offered and i am a french vanilla fan usually. the french vanilla is a close second and the hazelnut is a distant third. one packet of flavored and one plain packet is perfect for one travel sz. mug (14oz). no need to use two flavored packets as one packs a pretty good punch which is good since they are a little pricey. the only con is that they are difficult to open since there is no small start-tear on the top. you have to open it with your teeth and they are the tall plastic packets vs. regular sugar size paper ones. a stupid con i know but nothing can be perfect can it?

" tastes great - less calories. amazon's pricing is cheaper than my local grocery store so i stocked up ",positive
" of the several brands of agave nectar that i have tried this one is by far the best. it has the least taste to it - it is just sweet (very similar to simple syrup that you would make with sugar and water) ",positive
" i've been using agave in my tea coffee cooking and on pancakes for over a year. i'm a type 2 diabetic and need something with a low glycemic index. this product is the best - and it tastes wonderful. my kids don't miss honey on their pancakes any more and this keeps everyone from having sugar highs and crashes. highly recommend ",positive
" works great in coffee and tea and can be used in baking as well. ",positive
" there is one other cereal on the market that is very similar in crunchy...tasteful cereal!! i had both in my pantry and tried each independently and then together. this the one cereal that is good on any outing for breakfast with milk can of cream or just plain water on a camping outing. outfit your backpack with healthy goodies. no spoilage either. i was hiking for four days with kashi dried fruit several cans of juices. it is just the best approach for hiking with the minnimum lager on board ",positive
" always soft and semi-sweet real apples tastes kinda like a muffin without any air in i ",positive
" i tried pure bars after seeing them reviewed on a health website. the site waxed poetic about the flavor as well as the extremely high quality ingredients but i figured right -- these bars all end up tasting like dates no matter what flavor they are. well i stand corrected the flavor on these bars is excellent and is by far the best i've tasted (and i've tasted quite a few). that's a real bonus considering the fact that the ingredients are completely raw and organic and the whole bar is relatively low on the glycemic index. to those unfamiliar with raw food bars take note: if you're expecting any of them to taste like granola bars or candy bars you'll be disappointed. think fruit sweet instead and your expectations will be met. i can also vouch for the fact that my 2.5 year old daughter loves them. on to the chocolate next...

" very good tea. weak but nice aroma. mild good flavor. excellect for the price ",positive
" first tried this tea from a specialty store in buffalo ny where it sold for close to $60/lb. love it even though it was only 2 oz. search the net for this tea and found it amazon. it's a light delicate flavorful tea that can be brewed 2 to 3 times by refreshing it with more hot water. it is non-acidic like some other teas. it need no addition of cream or sweetner. i'm currently drinking 5 to 6 cups per day as it is so delicious and light. it's not exactly a green tea when brewed but a light amber color with the hint of a flora or fruity taste. the added plus at amazon is the price and very quick shipping. i would strongly recommend getting this tea for any tea lover and i'm sure they would be pleased if they enjoy a good quality chinese tea ",positive
" i got into various oolong teas from a great new york importer. they really know their teas! but this year the numi ti kuan yin is available at quality and price that bests the experienced importer. i dunno maybe they got lucky at an auction or somthing. but we've been enjoying this tea! you can spend 3 times as much and get better tea. but then it's too expensive to drink every day. buy this ",positive
" i ordered both the brown sugar jerky and the peppered and both were absolutely fanstastic. this jerky has a slightly tender consistency which makes it easy to chew. the flavor is sublime not too salty just the right amount of sweetness a real taste treat. i am on my second 2lb order. i am totally hooked ",positive
" this is truly great jerky and a fantastic price. don't let the price fool you...this is first class jerky. i order for the whole office and every person raves. my last order was for 36 bags of world kitchens (some of all 5 flavors) ",positive

" this jerky is not just an excellent value it is by far the best jerky we have eaten. i buy it every year as christmas gifts (and ofcourse save one pkg for us) and everyone raves about it. my family always looks forward to christmas because they know jerky will be there for the holidays. you can't beat the price and the jerky is actual strips of lean beef that is flavorful. the brown sugar has just a hint of heat with the sweetness. i would highly recommend this product. value and quality can't be beat. a+++ thanks!

" my husband and i like the newman o's better than oreo's and our 3 year old son loves them! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo. also the newman o's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have ",positive
" these cookies are superb all by themselves. far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way. but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry. your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more. keep out of reach of children ",positive
" everyone in my family (from 3 to 64 years old) loves these organic cookies. i purchased these cookies at several local stores before i discovered that amazon had them. i sent a package to my grandson who is in the army in iraq and he raved about them. newman's has another big winner! ",positive
" i do not like store-bought cookies especially oreos (too dry and greasy for me). but upon the recommendation of several people i tried the ginger o's and was pleasantly surprised. they have excellent flavor and the cream does not have that greasiness to it. if you like ginger cookies don't hesitate to try these ",positive
" my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream. these are a bit softer than the o's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat! =) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too - yummy ",positive
" i love the original vanilla creme newman's o's so when i saw the wheat-free/dairy-free on sale one day i picked one up. i figured it would basically be the same as the original. the chocolate and vanilla tastes are great but i found the cookies themselves to be rock hard. so unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products i would recommend the original vanilla creme and not the wheat-free/dairy-free variety ",positive

" the variety blend coffee pods are simply the best coffee i've had in a long time. i drink up to three cups of coffee a day but the one i look forward to the most is the cup i make in the morning on my senseo machine. the origins pods are the best of the best. these pods have a rich full bodied flavor that surpasses the other medium and dark roast pods that are available. get the variety pack and try them all. they are all wonderful ",positive
" we first bought these crackers in a local store and loved them. nutritionwise they are really good and have a great flavor and are oh so crunchy. never attempt a conversation while partaking you'll never hear the other person :-) after our first purchase we bought directly from dr kracker. then they told us of the great deal we'd get buying them thru amazon. and that's what we've been doing ever since. aways good for an in between meals snack with butter or peanut butter. then we'll have something more substantial on them for our lunch from time to time ",positive
" i saw this bread in my local health food store and it looked so good i decided to try it. i must say it taste just as good as it looks. this is by far the besting tasting cracker i've ever tasted. made completely from certified organic ingrediants this product is an excellent choice for the health conscious. and the price here at amazon is a great buy in comparison to any local retailer. i'm looking forward to this replacing the breads i usually use ",positive
" i tried this about two months ago and really loved it. i love the crunch and natural sweetness. i also made corn chowder with their corn product. i recommend this for any one who loves healthy natural snacks ",positive
" this is a very tasty & nutritious snack! no fat sweet & crunchy a great alternative to running out to the vending machine at work ",positive
" i really enjoy these as a light snack. they are only 85 calories a bag so it is easy to fit it in your diet ",positive
" the title pretty much says it all. i reserve 5 stars for what i consider the best of the best. i wanted a gluten-free cereal that was different from the few i've been eating over the years. this is definitely not like the usual crispy rice. it's much more substantial (not 90% air) has a nice though not too strong cocoa flavor and doesn't get soggy in the first two minutes after milk (or other drink product) is poured on it. another rater talked about empty calories. i'll be generous and assume that reviewer is not particularly familiar with reading (and comparing) nutrition labels. if a high quality rice is also considered empty calories that review would be valid. but comparing the koala crisp nutrition label to the nutrition label on a high quality rice reveals almost identical nutritional values - perhaps because koala crisp is a high quality rice. just as rice has never been claimed to be a fully balanced meal neither is koala crisp. what it is is a high quality product made with high quality ingredients (none of the artificial vitamins and minerals added to grocery store cereals to make them look better). and it's designed to be used as part of a balanced diet. with that out of the way it's just plain good. i buy it by the case and eat it several times per week for breakfast i like it that much. and no i have no connection with the company at all - i just love their products (many of them - not just this one). now if they'd just add this one to their line of eco-pak cereals (large bulk bags) i'd be even happier ",positive
" when i searched the net for pods there were lots of warnings that the senseo brand wasn't so good. granted i am not an avid coffee drinkerhowever i really look forward to a good morning cup of coffee that won't burn a hole in my stomach. i usually run one senseo pod through twice and have a perfect cup. if anything - needs a little more of the flavor (i.e. hazlenut vanilla) added to it. but still very good.

" these pods are excellent! same taste as your favorite coffee shop at a fraction of the price ",positive
" this is great granola and at such a great price! i usually make my own but for this price it's not worth the effort! thanks for the great value ",positive
" good quality granola not too sweet would give it 5 stars but it doesn't have enough nuts. super nutty it is not. it is worth the price though. my wife would give it 4.5 stars. she is mildly gluten intolerant and can eat this because it contains no wheat. ",positive

" dr. krackers are fantastic. they are different from any other cracker i have tried. they are very crispy which is what i love about them. they are delicious plain or with cheese and dips. because of their crispiness they hold up great for dips. i cannot say enough about these crackers. they come in several flavors while classic 3 seed is my favorite they are all very good ",positive
" best snack i've found in years. i keep these in my desk at work for a mid-afternoon appetite curb. highly recommended by all my family and friends ",positive
" i am addicted to these. they are delicious not dry at all and there are lots of crackers in each container. yum! ",positive
" this coffe is so delicious! it is bold and smooth. there's no bitter taste even when brewed strong. if you're looking for a great coffee with a smooth flavor and nothing bitter you' won't be dissappointed with timithy's colombian la vereda ",positive
" i use k cups all the time- at work at home etc. there are a handful of good k cup brands out there. this is one of the best. both decaf and regular timothy's columbian are smooth and rich in flavor. add some creamer and sweetener and goodbye to any other coffee!! you won't be disappointed. believe it or not the home brewing k cup machine(keurig) gives a better cup of coffee versus the commercial k cup machine(also keurig) because the hot water does not blast too quickly through it. fyi ",positive

" i really feel like this is the best overall coffee that i have tasted. as the name suggests it is intended for espresso but it makes an excellent cup of regular coffee. i love this roast for my lattes because it is so easy smooth yet full-flavored. if you are in the midst of a decision for what bean to purchase make this your choice. you shall not be disappointed ",positive
" the south korean oysters are the only ones i will eat nice size tender flavorful. avoid any from china ",positive
" i've always loved smoked oysters but most brands come packed in cottonseed oil which is vile to say the least. the crown prince oysters are packed in olive oil -- a huge step up in health and taste. they are convenient little bundles of protein that can be packed in a lunch etc. they taste wonderful added to soup or stew. great for last minute entertaining. last but not least i like to have a case on hand in my disaster supplies ",positive
" so these are basically ritz bits but with three differences: 1. the crackers are better; they taste more buttery and flavorful. 2. the cheese is better; it actually tastes like something that's met cheese in passing and maybe even shaken its hand. 3. they're all organic 'n' stuff so make you feel ever so slightly virtuous and less like a slave to big food. if you're packing lunches for kids (or snacks for yourself) these are great ",positive
" some people can tolerate spelt but not wheat --and if you are one of those spelt flour makes a great bread. it substitutes well but be aware that spelt requires less kneading (it has a shorter gluten fiber and breaks down if kneaded too long. we knead bread about three minutes.) spelt also makes lovely noodles and is fine in cakes. it seems easier to digest. it does have gluten and is a relative of wheat so if you are gluten-sensitive this is probably not an alternative ",positive
" we love cinna-raisin crunch for breakfast. the clusters are larger than average and hold up well in milk. the cinnamon and raison flavor is right for me. given few minutes to digest and it keeps me comfortably sated for hours. if you prefer small bites or smooth textures in your breakfast cereal the usual cluster size in this cereal might not be right for you ",positive
" these prunes are delicious to eat! since we started eating newmans organic prunes the store bought ones do not compare. we notice a difference and feel healthier for eating these. amazon is a place to shop in which we feel good buying organic products from them.. thanks amazon! ",positive
" these 6 oz packs of organic california prunes have more flavor than the non-organic brands. they are also drier and firmer which i wasn't sure i liked at first. i quickly grew used to it and now i prefer them this way. they are sweet and chewy. the freshness date is 16 months in the future so these would make a good addition to any emergency preparedness stock one might have. you can't go wrong at this price for 12 bags. this is one brand you can trust ",positive

" my wife and i have adjoining offices and we keep a variety of soups and snacks on hand so we can eat in together when we don't both have time to eat out. this soup is one of our favorites. we like the flavor and the texture (creamy with nice chunks of potato lots of corn kernels pieces of carrot and bell pepper). i keep a bottle of hot pepper on hand to spice it up but my wife prefers it as it is. we microwave it in the envelope and then pour it into two mugs. there's just the right amount in one evelope for the two of us when i have a sandwich to go with it. without the sandwich i find one envelope about right for me. this isn't the healthiest of the pacific foods soups that we've tried in terms of fat/protein/carbohydrate content. the beef stew is better in that regard but we don't like the beef stew without considerable extra seasoning (and it's very thin for a stew) and we like the creaminess of this chowder. we eat a balanced diet so that really isn't an issue. this is very satisfying and it's the one office food item we order again and again ",positive
" this is *awesome* soup!! i was a little iffy about it (about any soup coming from a can or bag!) but ordered it anyway it sounded so good. my hubby toddler and i *love* it and could eat it every week if we had more money to buy it! we took some on a camping trip and shared with all of our friends that we were with and everyone agreed how great it was. not as good as home-made but really really good! i'm not sure about the taste buds of the reviewer that gave it 1 star but we all thought it was worth getting again..! ",positive
" these bars are filling which is what i look for in my snacks/breakfast foods. they're nice and sweet won't fall apart on you like granola bars yet don't require too much jaw pressure to take a bite--it's the perfect consistancy. a great way to get some portable protien if you don't want to carry around a bag of nuts/seeds with you ",positive
" i have a briel espresso maker and these pods have made using the machine more convenient than my stovetop pot. i have used the expensive pods and these taste as good and have fabulous crema. enjoy ",positive
" the espresso pod is easy to use easy to clean and makes very good espresso. i am very happy with it and just ordered another box ",positive
" about to order my fourth box this year. it makes a smooth brew ideal for my latt ",positive
" we use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church. we consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes. i like how easy they are to use. no mess no tamping. i am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily ",positive
" i use this cereal for not only cereal but also to make rice crispy treats. yum ",positive
" it evens says snapcracklepop. not only is it delicious but it is very filling. it satisfies my urge to crunch and eliminates my problem with gluten products. i highly recommend this cereal ",positive
" my favorite things are often the most simple: a healthy alternative to kellog's rice krispies - with the benefits of organic ingredients rice syrup instead of cane sugar and an incredible company behind it all to boot - and this tastes even better! also rice syrup won't give you the 'spike' and 'crash' of conventional sugar and in fact supplies a steady stream of energy ",positive
" these are the best! they remind me of rice crispy treats. they're so chewy and delicious. i recommend these to anyone who loves peanut butter products ",positive
" if you love the taste of peanut butter then you will love the taste of these granola bars. they are chewy and do not break into pieces while eating them. a healthy delicious and quick snack ",positive
" i really like these as they are a lot less sweet than other brands ",positive
" they went over well in our house. the sugar content is semi-low and the peanut butter has good protein ",positive
" delicious and very filling. they can easily be used as a meal replacement ",positive
" i bought these because i have a corn allergy and wanted to substitute them for the la weightloss bars that list corn syrup as the first ingredient. i was pleasantly surprised that they were pretty tasty! my favorites are actually the fudgie filberts that taste similar to a little debbie brownie if little debbie's were diet. following that i would say almond and coconut are tied for second. third is the peanut butter which is the highest in protein but not as good as the others. my husband didn't like any of them but could tolerate the one i liked least peanut butter. over all i think these are great as a healthy snack for people with food allergies or other dietary restrictions. i think i would have picked a different name than betty lou's nut butter balls. nut butter balls doesn't sound as appetizing as what they actually are!! nut butter balls.....mmmmmm ",positive
" we have been using meyenberg's powdered goat milk for several years. we used to buy their milk in cartons at walmart and it was good. the only problem was that we live so far from a walmart store that we would run out of goat's milk between trips. we decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons. of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk ",positive
" i started using goat milk when my daughter was 1 because she did not digest cow's milk that well. this product is great has equal or more nutrition than cow's milk has a good flavor just slightly different than cow's milkis easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go i don't have to worry about it spoiling i just mix and give it to my daughter ",positive
" i prefer this powdered milk to the condensed form that meyerberg sells. the condensed has a more sour flavor to it. one has to realize that goat's milk is not cow's milk in that it is richer or creamier in flavor so it does startle one until your palate get's used to something which tastes different. when it is warm it honestly tastes about as close to what a milk product should taste. cold it has a slight powdered milk processed flavor. i actually made ice cream from this powdered milk and it turned out pretty good. it is like ice milk as this is milk but it was different and enjoyable but quite sweet. the recipe was 1 quart milk (8 scoops of powdered milk made warm and allowed to chill) 1 cup white sugar 1 tsp vanilla flavoring (you can try other flavorings like banana) 1/8 tsp salt my electric freezer will freeze this in 20 minutes. i like the powdered for it's ease and it keeps well. i can make up a quart and it will keep 2 weeks so it is on hand and not wasting or forcing someone who has limited use to drink a gallon of milk. granted one is used to cow's milk but this is something one can get used to if they have allergies and i am glad it comes in a nice metal can with a plastic lid to reseal after you pop the top and a plastic measuring scoop to get it right. one can will make 3 quarts of milk ",positive
" i used meyenberg powdered goat milk with my first litter of pups five years ago and was very pleased with it so made sure to stock up before my second litter was born. i supplement the mother's food with it and mix it with ground puppy food to make a puppy gruel to transition the pups to puppy food. the pups and their mother seem to love it and have suffered no digestive problems at all. it dissolves quickly in warm water and is convenient and easy to store. i recommend it as a nutritional supplement for nursing mothers and pups both ",positive
" i use these beans in a jura capresso superautomatic. everyone in our house likes the coffee because it has a refined taste. many coffees sold taste rather muddy so if you like a clear tasting coffee with delicate notes give this one a try. also has excellent crema ",positive
" the roast is more smooth and mellow than starbucks. i prefer it to illy. produces ample crema. it's a good value. after trying the first bag i ordered several more. the lavazza has become my daily espresso bean -- at least until the 8.8 pounds runs out! fwiw i grind with a rancilio rocky burr grinder and my espresso machine is a rancilio miss silvia ",positive
" espresso beans can be roasted in different ways. lavazza and illy represent the best of two different approaches to roasting beans for italian espresso. illy roasts their beans for a longer time but at a lower temperature than lavazza. as a result of its higher roasting temperature the lavazza is darker and according to some people more robust than illy is. at its best when properly ground tamped and brewed lavazza espresso is a bit stronger tasting and also a little bit more bitter than illy. the lavazza espresso also has a very pure black color once brewed and when it is done properly it has a hint of licorice in the aftertaste. personally though i prefer the illy approach which is why i am giving this coffee four rather than five stars. but even so i certainly recognize the high quality of lavazza. in my opinion lavazza represents the very best of the widely available dark (as opposed to medium like illy) italian espresso roasts ",positive
" this is a terrific espresso. i got hooked on lavazza in italy and haven't found any other espresso blends to knock it off it's throne. this is my first time purchasing lavazza whole beans and i think i'll continue to buy the whole beans for the freshness factor. would highly recommend! ",positive
" great taste! very creamy espresso with a natural sweet aroma does not need any other cream or sugar to ruin such a rich taste. the reason why your(to the previous reviewer) coffee tasted sour is because you failed to use a decent and suitable home espresso machine. if you had used the right method and machine it would have been nearly impossible for you not to enjoy the great taste this coffee can offer. these are very high quality espresso beans with a taste so full and rich that you would want to keep going back to it after tasting other coffees. ",positive
" i spend a lot of time in my van while out shooting wildlife photos. i buy a case of bottled water and keep some of these individual packets of drink mix. open a bottle of water and put in a packet of this drink mix and you have an instant refreshing drink. very easy ",positive
" lots of bang for your buck if you are a discerning hostess who enjoys offering guests a slightly off-beat non-alcoholic beverage. really like the packaging. like the taste too kind of like mountain dew with ginseng. ",positive
" i will never make home-made gumbo again this is so easy and good. 30 minutes and you have great gumbo. ",positive
" this is my favorite of essn's juices. it is unique and has a beautiful color which you see when using it as a mixer in cocktails. also a huge hit with kids. can't beat 100% juice. worth every penny ",positive
" i didn't know tuna could taste this good! and low mercury relieves worry about eating too much fish. i love shopping amazon. i experiment a lot and am never unhappy but this tuna is really wonderful ",positive
" this was the first time i have bought this and am very pleased with it. when you open the can the tuna is in one solid piece and not all sloppy like other brands. it tastes pretty good too. will buy again ",positive
" i thought tuna in olive oil tasted good but this is better. this is the tuna for salad nicoise; maybe use the other for mixing tuna salad ",positive
" am always looking for new ways to get whole grains into our diet. the pudding recipe on the back of the package is very good. even dh with incredible sweet tooth liked it ",positive
" this is the same crystal light lemonade that comes in the round containers but with the quanity buy much cheaper.great taste ",positive
" i discovered this in our local qfc grocery store which is the only place i've ever seen it and amazon's price is much better as i paid $8 for one package. growing up my mom used to make us bowls of pastina as comfort food. i call this whole wheat orzo my adult pastina. :) cooks up really quickly and is versatile in recipes and tastes wonderful. i highly recommend it ",positive
" i'd been looking for whole wheat orzo for awhile and it's almost impossible to find in any grocery stores. this is a very great pasta at a reasonable price. i've been very pleased with this pasta ",positive
" this is a very good source of fiber with good taste and texture that even picky eaters enjoy ",positive
" while i like all of the kashi products i've tried this one has to be my favorite! with a little fresh fruit how much more healthy can you get? great taste with seven grains and sesame! perhaps the other reviewer threw away the cereal and ate the box ",positive
" the pods are great. they taste great and brew great coffee although in my two different pod machines they brew coffee that tastes very different. the one thing to be aware of is that the pods are slightly thicker than many other brands and they may not fit right in some machines. the problem only occured with the double pod configuration for a bigger cup of coffee. ",positive
" this coffee rivals the name brand coffee house and right in my own kitchen. i am the only coffee drinker in my home so i make one or two cups each morning and the no-muss-no-fuss delivery of this system is unbeatable. if guests want a cup of coffee i am not brewing a pot just a cup as needed ",positive
" great flavor light and fluffy and good texture. only down side is that the bread tends to dissolve with to much moisture and has a tendency to be a little dry but great for sandwiches. unlike other gluten-free breads that tend to be so heavy that they over power anything you put in the middle. ",positive
" i ordered this for the mocha flavor but really cannot say that i found it. i will say however that this does make a very nice smooth cup of coffee so much so that although i ordered this for after dinner coffee i have been making it for breakfast ",positive
" mocha java is one of the smoothest cups you will ever have with a full bodied taste. it is so mellow it is almost buttery. i love it ",positive
" mocha java is almost as good as going to starbucks for a cup of coffee. i recommend it to anyone who likes the mocha flavor of coffee ",positive
" we have a new keurig coffee maker and just love timothy's coffees any flavor but especially the german chocolate. great price too ",positive
" my family all enjoys this product. the taste is good - very little aftertaste. the product is healthy and excellent for a quick snack ",positive
" i ordered a case of sardines through amazon grocery last month and they didn't travel well the box arrived soaked in oil. 4 cans had popped open and seeped fishy oil all over the rest of my order. upon inspection i could see that the design of the seals on the cans and the way that they were packed in their box made it a simple matter to pop the seals and any bump in transit could do it. sardines are not returnable items. imagine the mess of shipping them back? amazon handled my complaint in excellent fashion regardless. so i thought that i had better try it again. i ordered a totally different kind-same brand. these sardines are not quite as tasty as the others but they are quite acceptable. my cats like them and most essential: they arrived in perfect condition. that being said if you don't have amazon prime shipping you might consider getting it. it pays for itself quite quickly and it is so darned convenient. i live in the country and i work at home. it's a pain to go to town to shop for groceries books music whatever. amazon provides so many products i need. amazon prime gets them to me quickly and usually painlessly (those leaky sardines were my only problem among dozens of shipments). amazon does a tremendous job! i'm one happy customer ",positive
" i have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack. i know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but i've never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea. and they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with omega 3's too so it's as good for you as are the sardines. however i am not so sure about their actual mercury levels. buying them from amazon with their $10. off sale on $49. purchases is a great price. i've even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as costco and bj's no longer carry this product. or their price has skyrocketed. it's great to be able to stock pile them from amazon. if you like sardines you'll love these! and they are just so nutritious for us all ",positive
" the title pretty much sums it up. :) not too sweet and just absolutely delicious. every time i have a different cereal i wish i was eating this instead. i don't even know why i bother with the other kinds now that i've found this stuff...and it's good for you too! can life get any better? i submit that it cannot! ;) ",positive
" this is the best blueberry cereal i've tried. not sickeningly sweet excellent flavor and texture stays crunchy even mixed with yogurt. ",positive
" this is a great crystal light product. i like that you get vitamin c from it. it is a great way to get extra vitamin c with out popping a pill or taking in extra calories. tastes good too ",positive
" the coffee was very good. i just wish they had more items to select in the variety pack. i'm still looking for that one flavor that says this is it. i had a superb coffee in a local restaraunt and i've been trying to duplicate that taste for a couple of years now ",positive
" we have served this coffee at our sunday morning church services for 8 years... it is wonderful to know that we are not lining the pockets of some mega corporation when we buy from pura vida...but helping children and families. i heard one visitor who moved out of state and had not been in services for over 3 years say i knew i would get a great cup of coffee this morning! ... we love this coffee ",positive
" though resembling nothing like the common graham crackers found in most grocer's cookie aisle these small squares are quite delectable and relatively guilt-free ",positive
" i have ordered these twice now they taste so good! i also tried the chocolate wheat-free ones they were awful i would not order them again but have been waiting several weeks for the grahams to be stocked ",positive
" newman's own organics alphabet cookies are very chocolatey and very crunchy. the first time i tried them i was hooked! my two children also think they are fantastic. if you are have not tried organic cookies before these cookies are a good starting point. ",positive
" this coffee has a rich bold flavor dark color and nice aroma. very enjoyable drinking! comparable with starbucks bold coffees. ",positive
" i love this cereal; i eat it every morning with maple syrup or honey raisins and walnuts. it is never pasty for me as it is for the other reviewer unless i let it cook way too long or let it sit to cool too long. i cook it for five minutes turn off the heat and let it thicken a couple of minutes more as i add my raisins and walnuts and maple syrup. then i stir in rice milk until i get it to the consistency i like. though i don't like rice milk by itself or on any other cereal it does taste really good on this rice cereal with the added benefit of making the whole thing easier to digest. rice cereal is the easiest cereal to digest anyway but adding rice milk instead of cow's milk makes it even more easier ",positive
" forget the white tea at starbucks--clipper is the real deal! quick to make--requires just 30 seconds to steep. i do it with non-dairy creamer and a couple of tsp of sugar but this is pretty sweet by itself. but bmake sure you get the six boxes advertised here--or get them for pretty much the same price at whole foods ",positive
" i bought one box of this and my entire family tried it. it has since become a staple in each of our three homes. great taste with or without sugar ",positive
" pros: very tasty natural ( no preservatives ) cons: difficult to che ",positive
" i love these! the only thing good about being on a gluten free diet is discovering these cookies! i'm hooked. i love the coffee flavor mixed with chocolate. and for a dessert all the ingredients are pretty good ",positive
" these are quite good tasting! even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time. it would be nice as with most things if they were a bit less expensive and also didn't have to be bought 'in bulk' but overall they're very good especially compared to some other 'organic' offerings ",positive
" summary: peanut butter plain: a bit rubbery. i cooked them a little longer in microwave and added chips. ;^) peanut butter choc. chip: crispy crunchy crumbly rich and very addictive! (yes they always arrive broken up somewhat but you won't care.)(like other chip one only 5 oz. box) swirl shortbread: too heavy and buttery for me. nice texture. choc. chip shortbread: if you like shortbread this will taste decadent! rich choc. chips. crispy and yes also addictive! (note: only 5 oz instead of 7 oz. box) butter shortbread: couldn't really eat these. too heavy and buttery. least favorite. haven't tried others yet. i have a wheat allergy and never tasted shortbread again until i found these wonderful delights at the store in the health-food section! the shortbread choc chip i tried first has not only the unique taste of shortbread but has chocolate chunks also! they are crunchy and light. in comparison they weigh less than some other pamela products. they are not as buttery as the butter shortbread or swirl (a good thing in my opinion). i love the pecans also! recommend to any wheat-allergy sufferer or gluten intolerant person. :^ ",positive
" i tried betty lou's spirulina-ginseng balls because i read the nutrition information and you get 40% of your daily requirement for vitamin a in one serving. at this point in my quest to eat healthier i've read lots and lots of nutrition labels finding this much vitamin a in a snack is rare. finding something deep green in color that actually tastes pretty good is rare. if you're looking for a yummy sugery snack this is not for you! if you are looking for a healthier snack to replace grabbing for that cookie this snack is worth checking out ",positive
" i can't believe how great these are. i bought these about 9 months ago and they were going to expire so i decided to try one. i feel amazing!!! i had lots of extra energy without the side effects of caffeine. it tasted pretty good. ",positive
" these are a great substitute for granolia bars and much better for you. they are not based on grains but on greens instead. taste is a tad bit green but if you eat whole foods at all then you'll love these. -plus they give a good energy boost throughout the day! ",positive
" i tried this item just because it's a a ginseng snack. i found it to be not particularly tasty but the overall effect of increased stamina is true. i'm not sure about spirulina in general but one ball per day does the trick for me when it comes to increased stamina lasting several days ",positive
" i definitely love a cup of freshly brewed coffee. now that so many choose to have coffee numerous different ways there are just those who need the right filters. melita knows that with their coffee filters. they are convient and stronger in hold than any other filters on the market. they work great with #2 coffeemakers and especially are convient for those who've purchased the individual ground coffeemaker melita's perfect brew and perfect start coffee filter cups where all you have to do is just boil water and pour and you will get a convient cup of coffee. i really recommend melita a whole lot they are worth the price. price: b+ strength: a- overall: b ",positive
" some days after the kids leave the classroom i find myself reaching for the nearest available chocolate! not any more...this is a great healthy snack that satisfies the cravings and keeps me going for a few more hours. and there are no hidden ingredients that set off my food allergies which i really appreciate. they are maintaining their freshness well. i bought them for the price but am now going to try the other items in betty lou's kitchen ",positive

" i would buy this product from amazon anytime. it has always been grea ",positive
" i originally found these flatbread crackers while traveling. after returning home i longed for them so amazon came to the rescue with a source of these great flatbreads ",positive
" this kracker is just the absolute best. eating it alone when you need something crunchy or with healthy choice peanut butter or low-fat cream cheese - it just is an awesome product and i buy it in bulk cause i never want to be without it! i'd love to see a variety pack - kind of a sampling of all the dr. kracker goodies available ",positive
" i bought these crackers because i love cheese and seeds/nuts and am a low carb dieter. they are very good and i would have given them 5 stars except i actually liked the crackers without the cheese better. these are great for an occasional cruncy/crispy treat and i would purchase them again. they have a less sweet taste than the regular crackers and the cheese flavor is mild not artificial or too salty. i highly recommend them. ",positive
" i bought this product because it was a cheaper alternative to the senseo coffee pods i've been buying. i don't have much to compare with but overall this decaff tases fine ",positive
" i love pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds these are the best. the taste great are really crunchy - a key requirement for me - and have just the right amount of salt. the newman's rounds are just as good - maybe even better. and as an added bonus paul newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity - an unbeatable combination in my book ",positive
" everyone loved these pretzels. very flavorful not too salty. i plan on buying more from amazon best price i've found on this brand ",positive
" these pretzels are great!! i needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels. i had them prior to ordering them on amazon so i knew to expect they'd be awesome. several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat. however i like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel! i don't like too much salt and i found these pretzels average on the salt factor. like every other bag of pretzels the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me. the only thing i don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with organic spelt and also spelt. while they meet the standard to label their product organic they should use all organic spelt ",positive
" i was attracted to these because they have more fiber than most along with more protein. i think they taste great ",positive
" my daughters love this tasty pb natural snack. typically in the stores around here one box is close to $5. but this bulk buy makes it about $2.70 - a real bargain. already one day they've finished off one box ",positive
" i happen to love pecans and this product is loaded with them. it's too bad the cans are so small ",positive
" i was really impressed by the taste of this cereal. i was expecting the flavor to be like cardboard or something like this but instead it was really good. it was sweet (but not sugar sweet) and crunchy. i'll definitely buy this again. if the price went down i'd buy it more ",positive
" i love this cereal. i like the slightly sweet wheaty taste and the fact that it holds its crunch in milk for a long time. i also snack on it dry. it stays with me for a long time keeping me from eating junk ",positive
" my fav out of all nature's path cereals. and trust me i know nature's path cereals. calorie count = perfect. nutrition = perfect. everything is great about this ",positive
" we initially discovered this cereal at one of the big warehouse stores but they do not consistently stock it. we enjoy the flavor the fact that it is made from organically-grown grain and the health benefits of flax seed and high fiber. at the time of purchase we found the amazon price to be over a dollar cheaper per box than in our local grocery store. we bought two cases! ",positive
" this is an excellent quality product--nice clean filets packed in olive oil instead of who-knows-what. i really like having little glass jars instead of a tin that can't be reclosed if you don't use all the filets at once. my first food purchase from amazon was an excellent start ",positive
" ever since i returned from spain i have been looking for some decent anchovies to eat as tapas. these are just the right amount for a snack and the flavor is wonderful. if you have never eaten anchovies except on a pizza you are missing a great treat. i highly recommend these and even if you only eat them occasionally they will remain fresh in the glass jars ",positive
" didn't expect much with the price being this low but it's now a family favorite. can't tell the difference between this and jeremiah's kona blend but they are both have smooth rich tastes. it's one of our family favorites now ",positive
" having moved from a state where this popcorn was always available we were aghast that no one carried it in our new area! it appears that very few here like this wonderfully natural tasting lightly salted lower calorie popcorn but preferred those that heavily tasted of thick butter with lots of salt and coats the mouth with film. this popcorn pops fully leaving no kernels unpopped and doesn't need any additives. ease of ordering and prompt shipment make this a wonderful way for those of us who just have to have it! thank you [...] ",positive

" if you like hempseeds like i do. this is your best buy. amazon has the best price. the seeds came fast fresh and are terrific. to me they smell and taste even more fresh then the retail packages. the 5 lb bag comes vacuum sealed. i took 5 mason jars packed them in and put them in the freezer. i have a big bag in the refrigerator. i toss these seeds all over my salads. : ",positive

" i am a huge fan of tea. i have been drinking this one for years. i am astonished at the price -- such a great deal. anyway if you must buy tea in a box this is one to purchase. i love the subtle flavors of this tea. i always feel better after drinking a cup. it's even better if you add a little fresh (organic) lemon juice. ",positive
" other than the republic of tea the people's green tea i really like yogi tea healing formula. not only is it 80% organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract (protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation) should make one incorporate tea drinking in one's daily life. other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches body aches and pains digestion depression immune enhancement detoxification as an energizer and to prolong life. the only side effect is insomnia and i'm suffering from it but i know my immune system is thanking me for 6 cups of green tea each day!

" this is a nice smooth green tea. actually i have tried many flavors of yogi tea and they are all lovely. bedtime tea really does put me gently off to sleep. egyptian licorice has a nice little bite to it and the women's formulas help with hormonal issues. i have not found a bad flavor. : ",positive
" i just began baking with splenda when we found out my dad has pre-diabetes. for easter i prepared a sugarless ricotta tart with splenda and it worked beautifully. everyone agreed that it didn't taste sugar-free and my dad really enjoyed it. ",positive
" i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it. my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste--with the splenda there is none! you can use this to cook with too! it's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar ",positive
" i love splenda and i love getting it in a big bag. as a good ole oklahoma girl i live for my iced tea. and my tea must be sweet but sugar isn't an option. so splenda to the rescue. we use it in everything and are learning new ways to use it every day because my daddy has developed diabetes. the big bags are often out at our local grocery store so finding them at amazon with our amazon prime takes care of that problem ",positive
" i have found that splenda is a great sugar subsitute for a diabetic to use. it is great alone on food and also for cooking with. leaves no after taste like other sugar subsitutes do ",positive
" there is juvenile diabetes in our family and we have no other choice but to bake with splenda. after couple tries i found excellent splenda recipes and even guests could not tell splenda cookies from sugar ones. if you still feel splenda cookies are not the same add a teasp. of molasses in choc chip or oatmeal raisin and they taste exactly the same ",positive
" i'm a diabetic so i can't have sugar. in my opinion splenda tastes alot better than sugar and has no carbs from it. so if you're a new found diabetic and you think life is over cause everything food wise sucks just sub some splenda in the recipe and you'll be good to go. ",positive

" this product is the best. no aftertaste it's organic and has a low glycemic value. i use it in beverages. it's lighter than honey. in this bottle it squirts out easily. i seem to require a less amount than honey or raw sugar to gain the same sweetness. this is for the light. easy storage and does not change consistency over time. the regular might be heavier and could require even less for same sweetness.

" since going on the candida diet i've had to find sugar substitutes for most things and this agave has been a fantastic replacement. we've even used it instead of sugar in some baking and it's worked out great. ",positive
" i adore this light version of the madhava agave because it is so versatile. i use it in hot and cold drinks to sweeten without any sort of aftertaste. it mixes easily into both. it is the perfect compliment to tea or coffee especially yummy in a vanilla rooibos! i also use it in place of sugar in various recipes especially any dressings. i prefer it to honey because it does not crystallize and it has a very low gycemic index. when you eat honey it is like injecting sugar straight into your bloodstream but agave while high in fructose is slowly released into the bloodstream so you don't have that after sugar crash. use the amber variety in place of maple syrup but use this light version for any other type of sweetening! from one sweet tooth to another agave will satisfy! i'm off to make some tea..

" i like the nutiva hemp protein. a great protein source that is easier to digest than whey and also provides half of the daily required amount of fiber. can't beat that! it won't leave you feeling heavy and bloated like whey sometimes can. i like the taste and texture too. mixes great with cranberry juice/cranberries stevia ice and water! i add some berry green for extra energy and nutrients! it's my morning breakfast. ",positive
" i've been using nutiva products for years now and the protein powder is wonderful. i add it to a smoothie in the morning and it keeps me going for hours. it's a staple in my diet so i usually have one or two jars on hand. i highly recommend it ",positive
" i love the taste of this hemp protein powder. i love to mush up bananas with a fork add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the nutiva hemp seeds. it tastes great and satisfies me on every level. i also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands. i couldn't believe when i saw that there was 14 grams per serving. considering that 90% of americans are lacking in fiber this protein powder can be a great service to millions ",positive
" i mix this with orange juice berries and a banana in the blender and it tastes great. it took some time to get used to the grainy texture but it is much better than soy or whey protein. ",positive
" we recently ordered a case of this cereal from amazon and are down to our last box now! my husband and daughter have celiac and i don't-- but i eat more of it than they do-- it's really that good : ",positive
" my kids have tried i think all the gluten/wheat free ones and by far this is their favorite. they stay hard in milk and i an adult even like them ",positive
" my son loves this cereal!!! i always had to buy it at a health food store where it is usually almost $5 per box so when it was on sale i would stock up. i finally started buying another peanut butter cereal that also did not have gluten ingredients. he said he didn't like it as well but i thought he was just imagining the difference. well i decided we would do a blindfolded taste test to prove he couldn't really tell the difference. he was able to identify the panda puffs as his favorite every time no matter how we switched them around! he has even asked for a case of this cereal for christmas! guess that convinced me that there must be something to this cereal to make him like it so well. when i received a $50 gift certificate through the kidzeyes program as a prize i used it for some gluten free grocery items from amazon. i liked the items we tried so much i started an astore to promote the great tasting gluten free foods that are available at reasonable prices from amazon com. in fact that's the name of my astore: great tasting and gluten free. here is the link: [...] i have several items listed including envirokidz panda puffs with personal reviews of each. we have five people in our family eating gluten free and quality is very important to us! all the items i have on my page are personal favorites. now i order gluten free items from amazon about once a week for my family. sure beats going to the health food store over an hour away and paying much more for less selection ",positive
" i love this cereal. it is crunch and filling as well as great tasting. was very upset when stores stopped carrying it. so i was very happy that amazon carries it. many of my friends buy this also. ",positive
" smart monkey is my favorite brand of raw food bars. they have so much flavor compared to the brands you find in the grocery store! well done to whomever came up with the recipe... you are a smart monkey ",positive
" rather mild but pleasant tasting coffee...typically consistent brewing ",positive
" thanks for carrying this coffee. our local stores only carry the medium roast & cappuccino. it's nice that you carry such a variety ",positive
" i loved the idea and ease of the senseo but i was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted. the grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety so i decided to take a chance and order the columbia blend from amazon. i have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what i had been getting. if you are up for a change and want a smoother flavor but still a strong tasting coffee. give it a try! i will note that the bag only comes with 16 pods vs. 18 in the regular bags ",positive
" blends well in smoothies. taste is to me neutral which is a plus for whey. difficult to find plain whey from sports sources and when i have the taste is not pleasant. the others do contain whey isolate which is supposed to be superior so perhaps that is the difference. elderly relative was drinking bottled nutritional mixes (ensure etc) when she felt bad or had trouble keeping food down. they helped but smoothies are better. make them with whey egg whites (deb-el just whites here on amazon sells whites in smaller packages) natural chocolate (navitas naturals organic raw cacao powder) bananas and other fruit. she loves them. the whey and eggs whites give her all the protein she needs in a day in one drink (the egg whites lighten up the drink too but aren't really necessary unless you really want a protein boost). on bad days when she can't eat solid food i toss in a few tablespoons of deb-el powdered whole eggs to add fat and boost her caloric intake. ",positive
" i am a coffee afficionado! i'm a pickey coffee drinker and only use a french press to make my coffee from the freshest beans i can find. i keep my coffee beans in the refrigerator and grind them fresh moments before making my daily cup of coffee! this coffee was great and i have tried a million different brands!!! organic and fair trade is important to me!!! thanks for the extra effort! i wish the big guys would make this kind of effort!!! ",positive
" my husband's favorite jerky. used to buy single bag (much higher price) for special treat for him. just wish he would not go through eight bags so quickly.. ",positive
" these snacks are crunchy and mildly peppery. the taste resembles that of cottage cheese. a little under salted for my taste but still great. watch out for blobs of undissolved jalapeo mix you probably do not want to bite into those. ",positive
" i've tried a lot of cold coffee drinks and this one wins on all counts (even over frappacino). i have to have one every afternoon for a 'pick-me-up' treat! you will love this i'm on my 2nd case ",positive
" if you need a boost its here!! tastes great and gives immediant energy! i love it ",positive
" my doctor ordered me to eat heart-healthy food saying that raisin bran is one of the best for bulk count. he said it's a good idea to not only eat it for breakfast but to also eat a small bowl before dinner especially for those over the age of fifty who might tend towards constipation. it sure beats the prunes of my mother's day! i have always liked raisin bran and this packet of 70 individual boxes will last me a little over a month ... if i follow my doctor's advice. i also enjoy the convenience of amazon's new store for staple groceries. the only drawback i see is finding the extra storage space if i order everything to last a month. ",positive
" i bought this tea chest for my father. he loves it and it's a good deal for the money. it's the perfect storage solution and a pleasant way to select your morning teabag too. recommended ",positive
" this cake mix is absolutely awesome. very easy to prepare and is ohhh so good. for those of us who have to avoid glutens in our diet sometimes baked goods just aren't at all tasty but this one is so good my husband who is not gluten sensitive eats it and says he can't tell any difference from the regular spice cake mixes. will definitely be buying more of these ",positive
" i have bought these krackers before at our local health food store and was delighted to see that they could be delivered to my door. i received my shipment of these delicious spelt flatbread krackers this week. however the sell by date on each package is a week old. they seem to be fresh enough now but i am wondering about how long they will keep past the sell by date. it also makes me wonder about other amazon orders and the sell by dates on them. i will be wary of ordering other items with a short shelf life ",positive
" hazelnuts are tasty. a 4-pack is twice as many as you'd expect as part of a single package ",positive
" great way to pass the day at work. fresh and tasty ",positive
" these are as good as the ones you buy in the store. i was concerned about the quality but was happy to see that they are the same as those purchased locally. great price with discounts. most stores carry them for $1.99 for a 5 oz. packet ",positive
" in europe you find a bowl of dark flaxseeds to the side of the muesli set out on a breakfast buffet. a great source of omega-3 oil you can improve your health by eating these tasty nutty seeds. they are good for the gut and good for the heart. the golden seeds are an attractive alternative to the nut-brown seeds. they look nice in baked goods like lighter breads. they taste the same as the dark seeds. ground they don't show up in white bread so you can bust some up in the blender and throw then into your standard bread recipe and add needed nutrients and fiber. we like them sprinkled on oatmeal muesli or yogurt ",positive
" this is a good price for this amount of quality licorice. this is the traditional dutch concoction containing a strong salt taste and smell. not for everyone the taste of this product is less sweet but more long lasting than the licorice candies we are used to eating in america. if you know you like this strongly flavored licorice this is a bargain ",positive
" double salt licorice is a very scary flavor for the uninitiated. people don't like it the first time then start to crave it if they stay with the taste. if one doesn't like this licorice it's great to serve to unwanted guests ",positive
" my kids like these just as much and i feel better giving them organic products. (the chemicals and pesticide/herbicide residues in non-organic foods make me nervous. why take a chance when organics aren't that much more expensive anymore?) yes the cereal isn't artificially fortified with vitamins/minerals but my kids get a high quality multi-vitamin every day so there's really no worry. add a serving of fruit to increase the nutrition. i also add a little protein powder to the milk since getting a protein boost in the morning is very important for sustained physical and mental energy ",positive
" this is a wonderful (and healthful) snack. crispy and tasty and low in calories. each bag equals 1/2 cup of fresh fruit and the dried crunchiness of these seems to intensify the flavor of the fruits. there is also enough substance to meet the munchies moments. i highly recommend these ",positive
" it's a great new (at least for me) crystal light flavor. my husband loves it ",positive
" i tried to order this here but was sent tang instead. when i informed them of the problem they resent the order and again i got tang. their system seems confused by the tangerine description or they're just not very bright at the warehouse. i've had this flavor before and it is good: not too sweet and a bit tart. refreshing ",positive
" the stores near my house charge over $2 a box for the organic type. half of me thinks it's great to have it avail on demand through amazon for cheaper - the other half is ashamed to waste the fossil fuel on a special trip to my house. i think annie's should be able to make their product a little cheaper by now - it's pretty dang popular. oh well the alfredo variety isn't avail thru amazon right now anyway so i'm stuck (again) watching for sales and stocking up - which makes the formerly-ashamed half of me happy ",positive
" i bought this for my wife who has many food allergies. she cannot have wheat or items containg gluten. this is one of the best products i have found. its crunchy and tastes great. it seems that most things we buy for her lack one thing or another this product has it all. i even like it. she absoultely loved it and i am out of the dog house.....for as long as it lasts.. ",positive
" i have been drinking starbucks espresso but decided to give this a try i am so glad i did. this is by far the best espresso i ever had and yea even better than starbucks ",positive
" once i tried illy everything else tasted just ok. truly an excellent coffee flavor - smooth not bitter of overly strong. and the price is lower than any store i've check and even better than ordering directly from illy. at a price of $13 per can i was ordering five cans at a time to get free shipping. i love that i only have to order two at a time and it's delivered to my door! ",positive
" these instant potatoes are very tasty and so simple and fast to make. a nice buttery flavor and all you need is water. will be buying more ",positive
" my kids love mashed potatoes. these are sooo easy. no melting butter just add hot water. we love to have these as a midnight snack. just add shredded cheese and some sliced green onion and ummmmmm good. would have given them 5 stars but they're not quite as creamy as hoped ",positive
" great product---what else can i say? while i lived in the caribbean i ordered food since it was too expensive to buy good quality food there ",positive
" good texture good taste on the ahi tuna. almost as good as beef jerky. avoid the salmon jerky. most of the strips were hard and brittle. some were so tough they were barely edible...more fit for my dog. also the salmon was too spicy ",positive
" i eat these right out of the package. they are easy to put in my lunch box. the flavor is great i never warm them up but they would probably be even better if you did. i really like the sauce they are in. no complaints i just like em great taste don't take up much space. but very filling. highly recommend ",positive
" ...and i've tried quite a few. i tried over 30 varieties of green tea bags searching for a good cup and this one takes the crumpet! the flavor is strong but mild the color golden brown and the aroma is light. i threw out all the others (or rather i gave them to my father-in-law who also like tea) when i found this one and i bought a case of it.. ",positive
" this is a great change from the canola oil and shortening!! when i first got it i pan fried some fish in it and it was really delicious. doesn't add a lot of extra taste that you might think. also think it's not as stinky when frying as other oils. then i had to try it on my popcorn. oh that is really wonderful. only problem i had is in delivery. the oil wasn't sealed well enough and it got warm enough during delivery to become somewhat liquid. some of the liquid leaked out in the box. just a warning if you live in a warm climate area ",positive
" i wont go into the quality of this product or the nutritional benefits as i think the 4.5 stars and the customer reviews speak for themselves. however i think you will find the 54 oz for 20 bucks is the best deal on the internet especially when you buy two and choose the super saver shipping option. i would challenge anybody to find a better deal for pure coconut oil of the same quality ",positive
" they give 1% of all profit off the top to charity and activism. truly awesome company. ",positive
" this is 100% organic unrefined coconut oil. yes it tastes like coconut but it is supose to. a food should taste like what it is! the nutritional value of this food is outstanding. it contains a lot of lauric acid which is also found in mothers milk and is both antifungal and antimicrobial. it is stable at room temperature and does not become rancid quickly like other popular cooking oils. it requires very high heat to release free radicals (i do prefer red palm oil for high heat cooking options because it does not release free radicals at all). my suggested uses: smoothies slow cooked baked goods sauteed foods mixed with maple syrup over popcorn homemade cosmetics and as an occasional conditioner for dry ends of long hair. ",positive
" love this. great substitute for shortening. keeps baked goods moister and is excellent for cooking eggs and vegetables. ",positive
" i was pleasantly surprised that this product had pop-top lids. the chicken is packed in water but not soupy. it was a pretty good buy because i also bought another product and got a $10 discount on my $49 purchase. i actually bought this chicken to mix with my dogs' dry food from time to time. i was buying canned dog food but it stank and i was finding shards of chicken bone in it. after reading about dog food ingredients on paul newman's newman's own website i switched to his dry food. i have to mail order it so i don't buy his canned food. despite the fact i bought it for the dogs i did try a can of this myself. it was better than i expected. i was afraid it would have a funny taste to it from the can but it didn't. it has an expiration date of 9 months from my purchase date. the cats liked it too so i'm sure i'll be buying it again ",positive
" i first had these in alaska and when i returned my taste buds couldn't stop thinking about them! they are a great alternative to fast foods. ",positive
" these are really great. they are very sour when eaten alone but amazingly good in cereal or oatmeal. a great fruit to have on hand especially when they are out of season ",positive
" i love the way the fruit rehydrates in the milk in my breakfast cereal. absolutely delicious ",positive
" i've been eating gluten-free for 5 or 6 years and mostly made my own bread cookies and crackers because gf food was hard to find and about as tasty as cardboard. thank goodness for nature's path; their corn flakes are tasty (but don't make a good coating in recipes that call for regular cornflakes sadly) i love the panda puffs and koala crisp (yes i'm a grown-up and i eat these cereals) the kids love the gorilla munch the organic crispy rice bars with peanut butter are a favorite and these vanilla animal crackers don't last long in my house... even the non-celiacs love them! i haven't tried the other flavors but these have a pleasant smell a crunchy texture like a real animal cracker are not crumbly or gritty and have a nice cinnamon-y aftertaste. i buy these by the case ",positive
" these are truly good gluten-free cookies. we have recently made the switch over to a casein-free (milk free) gluten-free diet for the sake of my son. he is already a picky eater so i was worried about the transition. these cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served (ie in church school etc). he is particularly enamored with them because they have kid-friendly animal imprints. being gluten free they do tend to break more which can be upsetting for young kids but they taste so good he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces. ",positive
" we use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church. we consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes. i like how easy they are to use. no mess no tamping. i am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily ",positive
" over the course of one day while at my work desk. as other reviewers noted they are light buttery and delicious! i'm using the second box for homemade (sorta') ice crem sandwiches. they are so tasty they really are fine plain. now i wished i had ordered several cases when they were on sale for $12 but maybe then i'd eat too many ",positive
" let me start by saying that i am a huge fan of all things swedish from lingonberries to salt cod to lutefisk to those yummy red candy fish. when i saw that jules destrooper had invented yet another swedish delectable i could not wait for my package to arrive! after assaulting the ups driver and absconding with my butter waffles (which are more like cookies) i went into my kitchen and sat down in my breakfast nook to eat them. a hearty glass of milk was all i needed to drench the entire box and consume it. in reality i ended up saturating the cardboard box and must have eaten that as well because when i was done there was nothing left save for some soggy nuggets stuck to my ceiling. i assume they are from my delicious waffles and not from my earlier experiment of stuffing a cornish game hen with popping corn to make its own stuffing. i am still picking bits of hen from my bushy inappropriately dark eyebrows. also some recipe ideas for these waffles include topping them with olives tuna salad anchovy and pretzel (an old slavic favorite) and peanut butter. sometimes i give these to the neighbor children when they behave themselves and actually i have only given one out to one neighbor child. my neighbor's kids are usually misbehaving and absolutely do not deserve any of my tasty cookies! anyway it turns out the one kid i gave it to was actually a lawn jockey statue which makes sense because my neighbors the davenports have very light skin. they are actually quite pasty and i am waiting for the day when one of them develops melanoma because they are always out in the sun in their pool having a heck of a time under the sun's deadly rays oblivious to the cellular damage they are inflicting on themselves. i prefer to stay inside during the daytime and nighttime hours usually venturing from my house every fortnight to collect my mail. however when i know a delivery of jules destrooper butter waffles are arriving i am on high alert and spring from my rascal mobility scooter whenever i hear a car door close. overall i love these waffles. buy them and if you don't love them too send them off to me!! ",positive
" these butter waffles are very tasty- very light yet rich and buttery. they're hard to resist couldn't help but eat a whole box. only downside is that it uses vanillin rather than real vanilla. however it goes great with ice cream and fruits ",positive
" from where i should start! from the amazing taste the nice smell or the natural ingredients. do you know? try it and tell me your opinion. ",positive
" valerian and chamomile are blended with spearmint leaves lemon grass hawthorn berries and orange blossoms to create a delicious tea to savor late at night before you drift off into dreams. this tea is much more effective than regular sleepytime and i can say this because my sleep cycle has been fairly regular with much fewer nights of tossing and turning. you may also find that your mood the next day is rather mild and you feel more relaxed in general. this could be due to getting a good night's sleep for a change or it could be that the valerian has a lasting effect. valerian is a very effective herb if you can't get to sleep and this tea is highly recommended for insomnia. unlike sleeping pills you won't feel groggy the next morning. blend in a little lavender or orange blossom honey to enhance this deliciously mild minty tea. ~the rebecca review ",positive
" this product is a great evening tea to help you relax and gently eases you too sleep. before this i was taking harsh medicines like tylenol pm's and such and always woke up feeling worse than before i went to bed! not with the tea! let me clarify it will not knock you out but just help to relax you ",positive
" we've enjoyed this sparkling meyer lemon juice enough that we've reordered it. we love the sparkling blood orange and cranberry juice combo but it's nice to have some variety. the meyer lemon flavor comes through very clearly and is quite refreshing. we also like the light sparkling quality of the juice. this juice makes an excellent mixer for drinks. ",positive
" i tried this drink with some friends and everybody loved it. the meyer lemon is very distinct and has a great taste. essn meyer lemon makes the best lemon drop ever. i would highly recommend essn for your next event or party!! ",positive
" nice clean meyer lemon flavor. these lemons are just a tad bitter and have more sweetness than any other lemon. chefs love using these lemons in recipes. this flavor also makes a great lemon drop ",positive
" this is my favorite cereal ever. since i started eating only organic i picked this up one day and i love it. i eat it every morning for breakfast ",positive
" one reviewer writes that these are oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! these thin oreo crisp wafer type cookies by nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. they also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient. these crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray! there are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. they are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy french fries. these crackers somehow manage to give you the full oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories too. excellent! these oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. this makes them even more portable for both children and adults. another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. this way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have. i notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that. i recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. they should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. they make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol. buy some and enjoy them today! smiles ",positive
" makes an excellent cup of coffee with eye opening aroma and better yet profits from this fair-trade company are invested in an orphanage in the community where the beans are grown. so drink a whole pot ",positive
" having tried senseo pods millstone etc. i was surprised that good old folgers is just as good and in some cases better than senseo's newer flavors. while made for the home cafe these fit senseo coffee makers and give you a good cup for a lot less than the more upscale brands ",positive
" these are great and taste just like the real thing ",positive
" never guess these are wheat free! whole family loves them. will continue to purchase ",positive
" product arrived when it was supposed and exactly as in the ad. i'm glad i ordered item ",positive
" if you have a small child who is hard to get to bed at night put them in a routine. make them some sleepytime before bed (you can add splenda or honey to make the tea sweeter). this will calm thier nerves and make for a restfull night of sleep. this has also shown to me to prevent a fight from a child who does not want to go to bed. with a cup or two of this tea they should be off to sleepyland. this tea does have a distinct taste which can be hard for some to get used to. i add honey or splenda to my tea to calm the bitter taste down. this tea is like chammomile - with little to no taste. so you'll need to add lemon juice or honey to make this tea taste good. this tea can also calm you after a hard days of work if you've been over worked or stressed out. i give this tea to friends and loved ones who are going through stress or issues to remind them to relax ",positive
" this kenya blend is a mild but very tasteful coffee. no burned taste at all and it has become my favorite ",positive
" good servive. faor price. this coffee could be a bit stronger to my tast ",positive
" i don't know a whole lot about coffee but i do know that i really like the taste of this. some of the senseo coffees i have tried have been chemically and harsh (specifically some of the flavored ones) and required a lot of cream and sugar to become palatable. this however requires just a drop of cream and less than a single pack of sugar. the flavor is a little bit weaker when it first hits your tongue as a result but it strengthens over the next 5-10 seconds. it never gets overpowering but it is very pleasant. if you need a quick boost of caffeine then you can drink it fast without killing your tongue. if you want to sip it then you might want to make it a little bit stronger than they recommend but it is still very good ",positive
" as with all newman's own products you find great quality with what you've purchased and also good value. paul newman has given over $150 million in thousands of charaties worldwide since the establishing of the newman's own line. one box of these raisins is 130 calories with zero fat & cholestrol. it's a good healthy snack to have around and enjoy from time to time ",positive
" my kids love these lollipops! so does my husband! the flavors are great and they are the perfect size - not too big and not too small. they taste better than the other artificial ones you find at the grocery stores ",positive
" these are the best tasting lollipops you will ever have. because of my 2 year olds food allergies i discovered these and now her doctors office is purchasing them even the hospital my husband works at. these are allergy free and amazing!!!!!!!! ",positive
" i've been making holiday turkeys for over 30 years. this year for the first time i used turkey perfect...and without a doubt this was the best moistest most flavorful turkey i've ever done. i told a friend about this product; she called me to rave about her absolutely delicious turkey. even relatives who don't really like turkey went back for seconds...and thirds... for the first time ever we had no turkey leftovers this year ",positive
" this soup is delicious! unfortunately it makes a bit much for one person but it is a good leftover. very tasty ",positive
" we really like these. the lemon flavor is heavenly. the cookies are crisp and light... very very good ",positive
" i was introduced to these when i bought a can at a big lots store and found that they were so good that i went on line and bought a case. i highly recommend this brand to anyone liking sardines. stan re ",positive
" small no sugar a bit harsh tasting (might end up better diluted a bit with club soda). this is pretty well true of the four i have tried. but in some ways the harsh tasting is good--the 12 pack can be doled out at one per day per person. does act as herbal medicine? i have no idea. but it's very nice to have a treat that i don't really want to consume all of in one sitting. like for instance gummy bears. ",positive
" we bought these because there was an online coupon for them. my children (ages 11 and 14) take lunches to school and i was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices. the price was right and with the free shipping when going over $25 it was hard to resist. the fries are light and airy like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor. they are a nice change and we're really enjoying them ",positive
" i love these things. amazon is the only place i found to order these cheddar fries. the 1 oz. bag is the perfect snack size especially for those on ww. each 1 oz. bag is 3 points. not bad for a junk food snack!! awesome price and fast delivery ",positive
" this is a really delicious natural alternative to other frosted flake types of cereal and you cannot beat the amazon price ",positive
" the other review was strictly from a nutritional standpoint and did not address taste. where i agree nutrition is very important when you have a child with celiac disease or food allergies finding something that they will like to eat is a huge challenge!! this cereal is excellent for taste & consistancy and it is gluten free! if you need something for breakfast before school give them this and a multivitamin! ",positive
" this is a good granola. i like that it has lots of seeds with the grainy things and a few nuts tossed in. nice taste. thanks to amazon for carrying so many gluten free items! makes like so much easier!! ",positive
" this granola is delicious. being that it's gluten free is a bonus since it's so hard to find acceptable healthy foods within that diet. but my family can eat whatever they want and they couldn't stop eating it! the cranberries bring a wonderful touch of sweetness to the nuts and crunchies. this is a great treat to keep with you when you want a more substantial snack ",positive
" i feel better serving this mac & cheese than all the others out there - no artificial colors or flavors and it tastes great! cheese sauce is on the salty side so i throw a bit of my own pasta in with the shells to cut sodium content. ",positive
" i would have never bought this stuff but a friend was making it one day and i tried some. it was sooo good. i had always just made craft* before this stuff but now i'd say i eat this just as much. it's a great way to change up the normal macaroni taste. and did i mention it's really good too. it's kinda salty tasting with a creamy white cheddar texture. my favorite is when you get a noodle full of undistributed cheese..mmmmm. i also love it because it's organic. with each day of my life i'd say i'm eating smarter and this product was the next step in my plan. i can't wait to try out the other flavors and different products. i'd like to see this being sold in ralphs market soon. as of now i can only find it in vons/safeway ",positive
" tastes very good in my oppinion and in the oppionons of two of my friends who tried this product too. not exceptionally great (hence the 4 stars) but good enough to enjoy eating. big pieces of meat and plenty of it. plus it's all natural including the beef which was not from hormone-fed cows which is also important in my oppinion. would buy again ",positive
" i loved the taste but the beef was quite dry. it's very easy to heat up and probably would be great for a college student as an emergency meal ",positive
" if it were not for the fact that these nuts were not packaged properly they would be rated at least a 5. i called the manufacturer and they told me it must have been at the factory. they were not full cans. none were full to the top but two of the cans were not even half full. the manufacturer sent me two coupons for the two cans that were about half full. i felt the whole order should have been replaced but two cans is better than none. as i said the product was excellent but i would not spend the money again to possibly get the quantity i got. well all i can say is nuts to that. gail napolitan ",positive

" orange pineapple has been my favorite flavor for years. when it's out of stock at my local supermarket i go out and look for it. it's the best ",positive
" the beautiful cobalt blue package contains deep dark shiny coffee beans that release a rich and robust flavor ideal for the real coffee lover. the price can't be beat for organic coffee of this quality. i will continue to buy it from amazon.com. ",positive
" i had read other's reviews about how great this coffee was but i was using another coffee that i thought was really wonderful. i tried this one and now i am hooked. it is wonderful if you like bold coffee which i do. i also like the fact that it is organic. i don't drink a lot of coffee each day but the cup or two i have i want to be great. just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee ",positive
" this coffee is awesome! the aroma and taste are like a little bit of heaven for a french roast aficionado like me! the price is great and the shipping is quick. i am really glad to see that it is organic as well. this sure leaves that pricey brand in the dust ",positive
" none of that super-sugared [candied] dried fruit or flat tasting candy [e.g. chocolate] chips to mess up a yummy but healthy snack. don't get me wrong i love chocolate--the darker the better--but what they put in trail mixes is worse than nothing. if i want candy i'll buy the good stuff. thanks amazon. my local market no longer carries it ",positive
" this has the perfect blend of sweet and salty combination without the guilt ",positive
" i don't normally review items but i had to write something on this because all of these it's too salty comments are driving me crazy. these are hardly salty at all. there is far more salt in potatoe chips or popcorn or basically any other snack food. my bag says its only 8% of your daily sodium which is much lower than you would think from the comments people are leaving. i'm a man so i personally think these could use more salt ",positive
" i used to love just corn but i like this brand even better. i agree they could cut the salt a bit but i think some salt is a nice compliment to the corn ",positive
" this is my new obsession. i am a voracious snacker. i love corn on the cob. this tastes just like it. only 70 calories per package. i never thought i'd be writing a review about corn but i like it. i am going to try the other varities of this line ",positive
" delicious and crunchy with a slightly sweet blueberry flavor. healthy ingredients - no added refined sugar and no wheat. great product ",positive
" these only take 1 minute to make the noodles are already expanded as in not dry - they taste great and i dont feel like i just ate fast food when i finish one of them.. or two : ",positive
" this annie chun's udon soup is very easy to prepare. i don't think the first step is necessary either. just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1/2 minutes. add the sauce packet. the noodles loosen up after you stir it. if you what a more filling soup add meat/vegetables. my kids and i really love this soup! i just purchased more from amazon because it's a better buy here than at the grocery store ",positive
" i started to love annie chun's udon soup in march 2007. although it was on my amazon grocery list for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great. i just ordered many a. chun's soup noodle bowls. and i will order more again in future. annie chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on amazon.com ",positive
" ever feel like you want that little something with your tea or coffee but you abstain because you're on a diet? that was a problem for me at least. i've been trying to avoid white sugar and white flour in an effort to lose weight. well just when i'd about given up finding a suitably healthy alternative along came dr. kracker spelt muesli crackers! they are all natural contain no white flour or sugar do have some dried fruit for that right amount of sweetness that makes them satisfying as an accompaniment for coffee or tea! highly recommended ",positive
" was visiting my daughter and found these wonderful habit-forming crunchy with a hint of sweet crackers - i don't want to eat anything else now! hope i can get them where i live in ny soon ",positive
" everyone of us usually loves to make a fresh cup of coffee in the morning. nevertheless getting the best quality filters are definitely the biggest hastle for your coffeemaker. these melita cone #2 coffee filter are one of the best made filters around. they are woven tight and completely seperate the ground coffee from spilling into your carafe or your mug if you use melita's perfect brew mug coffee makers. i like these a whole lot because they really help make the best coffee around. if you want to make a great cup of coffee than you'll definitely want to get some of the best filters available. i definitely suggest you buy these #2 coffee filters. it is a definite buy so drink up! price: b+ quality: a- overall: b+ ",positive
" this is decent rice with a lemony herb flavor that is pleasant. it's a bit heavier than fresh cooked or frozen rice but works great in a rushed day ",positive
" he did not know if he would but he loves them. great for a quick snack or a snack to go. please don't quit selling these. glad we bought them and will buy more ",positive
" these are yummy vegan treats but they are kinda small for 120 calories and 4.5 grams of fat. but they are a good snack ",positive
" they taste so great i had to limit how many my kids could eat each day. ",positive
" having to get a mindset and change eating habits due to health issues has proved to be a challenge but with so many snacks that can be had that are actually good for you and that taste good it has been pretty easy. this item for one we love!!! what they are not: airy super sweet empty calories. what they are: please read the nutritonal chart (so i don't have to type it all out) the sodium level is a good choice for those that have to limit salt intake. calories are not outrageous. they have a slight taste of caramel that comes from the rice syrup/peanut butter. they were not overly gooey. they are a bit more weighty than the 'others' but it's because there is some substance here. we have learned to eat and enjoy our food at a slower pace so one will suffice vs 2-3 of the 'others' we use to scarf down in one sitting.....i give 5 stars as product was in date tasted fresh has a good taste nutrition worthy packaged conveniently.

" just like all the other betty lou's products i've tried (and become hooked on) these are delicious. individually wrapped they are a convenient and nutritious treat to take anywhere. so good ",positive
" even non-celiac people should switch over. here's an amazing gravy for chicken or pork chops. try it next time and serve next to mashed potatoes: 2c. water and 1/2c. mix. bring to gentle boil over high heat. remove from heat immediately. stir in 1/4c sour cream. pour over meat browned in a skillet. simmer on lowest heat until meat is cooked through turning and stirring often to prevent skorching. hmmmm. i'm getting hungry ",positive
" i've been gluten free for 5 years (due to my son 1-1/2 personally). i always had trouble duplicating my favorite casseroles because of them needing cream of mushroom soup concentrated. with this mix i mix double the amount to the water so each container makes 3 instead of 6 and it tastes just as good as the gluten variety! i haven't tried it as just a soup but it's the only thing i'll use in casseroles ",positive
" i have used this cake mix many many times. the first time my daughter made it for me for my birthday. she said she thought it would be difficult to make it with a hand mixer but was a snap with my large stand mixer. i have since made it many times and it is a favorite for birthday parties in our office even though i am the only gluten-free person. i add fresh orange juice and peel instead of the vanilla and serve it with strawberries or fresh fruit and whip cream...yummy ",positive
" i hate to bake but this cake is so easy to make. i didn't have the problems the others did and i followed the directions on the box. however i have a very old and powerful stand mixer. i beat it on the highest setting and this cake comes out great. i feel horrible that the others didn't get this cake to work - it really is incredible. i frost it with a light frosting and serve it with strawberries. everyone loves it! i am the only person in my house on the gluten-free diet and the others (husband and 4 children) think it is the best. the only difference i have noticed is that it isn't as high as a betty crocker cake mix but it is light and fluffy. you really need a stand mixer to make this but it is quick easy and tasty. my stove is also older and the temp is a little hot. for gluten free baking i turn it down 25 degrees and bake everything a little longer. but my mom uses this mix and hasn't had any mishaps. she has a newer stove and follows the cooking temp and time on the box. by all means if it is not at the right stage (soft peak if i remember correctly) beat it longer than the box instructs. ",positive
" this stuff is great...and we can't find it in our grocery store in galveston co. texas. now i don't have to wait until we fly to the northwest! very cool ",positive
" love this stuff. great for adding invisible fiber supplements to as well. no after taste at all ",positive
" these are great! very smooth and yummy. the only thing is i think they are a little to sweet for me. i just add a little more coffee and a tad of milk then they're perfect! i'll buy them again for sure ",positive
" i am a big fan of coffee. other than water it's all i drink. so when i found this i had to run with it. it's cheaper than red bull has more power than it. it's better for you than red bull and it has a nice flavor that does not leave an aftertaste. my frig is stocked with as i type! ",positive
" both bags that i received were quite tender and had great flavor. not too sweet and not too spicy. i will definately be ordering some more. my dog mr doodles also loves it ",positive
" this was a very tender jerky. it's not the kind that wrenches at your teeth. if you're looking for hard-core jerky look elsewhere. back in my youth i used to love that sort of thing. but with the sensitive teeth i have now i need to show a little discretion. this jerky was great. it was tasty. it had a little heat which i appreciated. the only drawback were the spice. there's something really hard in the spice mix that nearly broke my teeth on more than one occasion. there's 2 bags but it went fast. it was that good ",positive
" after reading that bentley's has the finest ceylon teas in the world i decided to give this as a christmas gift to my husband. he says it is the best tea he's ever had and since he is somewhat of a tea connoisseur i would consider that a compliment. the box is beautiful and it makes a lovely presentation ",positive
" this drink mix is really good. it tastes just like other drink mixes but is only five calories. it is definately a good choice. they also have other flavors such as: lemonade peach tea raspberry ice pink lemonade and more ",positive
" this mac & cheese is really creamy without tasting processed and it has the right amount of salt. very good product overall ",positive
" this is real italian espresso the best you can find on the market. if you have an espresso machine and know how to use it then you got it made...rich flavor and sweet at the same time ...i've known this product all my life growing in italy ...excellent ...the very best ",positive
" i love the pod idea...makes cleaning so much easier. this is perfect for a quick shot of espresso after dinner. excellent ",positive
" wow no wonder you can't get this anymore. they probably can't make them fast enough. this is such an unusual gift set. the pot is so cute as well as being a nifty display item. the teas are all individually packaged and ones that you wouldn't find anywhere else. makes you want to drink tea all day. the box that it comes in (as well as the individual tea box) is reuseable and so pretty. i hope that this item is offered for sale again soon as i would buy a dozen of these to keep on hand for gifts...and maybe one for myself!! ",positive
" this is a great way to try the teas before you buy them in any type of quantity. the pot brews about 3 cups of tea. i don't drink the tea often - i prefer to have it as an infrequent treat to keep the experience special. i will update my review as i try the different teas. the dragon lily tasted wonderful but the flower was really ugly. however i did buy a box of this tea and when i brewed it the flower was more colorful and appealing. i was able to steep this flower 4 times for 12 cups. although i admit that the last three cups didn't have as strong a flavor. starlight rose was disappointing. the flower never changed appearace just got bigger. the flavor was strong and left my mouth feeling pasty. flower jewel lavender dream emerald sun jade fortune jasmine pearls unwind to become long thin leaves. the scent is heavenly. the taste is not quite as dramatic but still good. i used approximately 1 pearl for each cup of tea to brew it (3 pearls per pot). black beauty midnight peony ",positive
" this is an incredible set for tea and some incredible tea. at more than half the price it is a nice organic store you might find it at (no offense to organic stores but a %200 mark up is a little much). this tea is the best ive ever had great for a gift as well id get one for yourself and a couple for birthdays and whatever comin up ",positive
" great for novelty gifts. but don't give it to true tea lovers!!! different kinds of flowering tea look great & very entertaining to watch bloom but taste pretty crummy. i would say most of them taste somewhere between stale and tasteless. nevertheless it's a nice gift because of the experience and the cool box & glass pot you get to keep ",positive
" a great alternative to the junk-filled mainstream variety. i am hoping they come out with a regular flavor as well as the chocolate ",positive
" when my kids started kindergarten they needed to pack a lunch everyday. my wife realized that this was a teaching opportunity about nutrition making the right choices and responsibility. each day the kids pack their own lunches from lunch box central. each lunch must contain a protein (usually yogurt) a grain (some form of cracker or grain filled bar) and a fruit (apple banana or fruit cup). envirokidz organic crispy rice bars are a staple in lunch box central. they're convenient the kids enjoy them and they're a reasonably healthy choice. the kids are happy they're learning and they're eating well. my wife is pretty smart ",positive
" great taste and value! it taste best with a high quality honey! a must for tea drinkers ",positive
" certainly there are more expensive teas but i've yet to have a better cup than twinings earl grey which is a perfect blend of comfort and spice. it works brilliantly as a good morning how do you do or a rest well sweet dreams sort of a beverage. many other earl greys on the market struggle with the proper blending of the bergamot oil which can be quite overwhelming if overdone; but it is what makes earl grey unique so one does want to be able to taste it. too many other tea companies cannot seem to grasp this delicate balance but twinings has always gotten it just right. the tea can be enjoyed au naturel or with a slight dash of cream...not too much because you don't want to drown out the enjoyable lively flavor of the bergamot. for me when it comes to a cup of hot tea this is simply the best. ",positive
" i love this popcorn and this was such a bargin price compared to store price. thanks amazon!!! ",positive
" i love this popcorn... but can't find it locally. thank goodness i found it online so i can still get it ",positive
" it is so good to taste popcorn that tastes as if it were taken right out of a pot of boiling water buttered and salted to taste. the smell of corn on the cob runs throughout the house. great summer smell all year long ",positive
" this spread is way too good! my husband and i have both tried spreading it on toast but it really stands alone. i like to eat it just straight out of the jar. the spread is a perfect blend of flavors. if you have a sweet tooth and don't always have other sweets on hand a spoon of this stuff will satisfy all your cravings. unfortunately this spread has no nutritional value to speak of so i doubt i will order it again. 6 jars is plenty for us. you have to order it at least once though! ",positive
" very good - not a rich dessert by any means but a healthy filling snack. my kids really like them and while they aren't low-calorie or really low-fat it isn't full of sugar and it contains healthy fat. the 5-grams of protein per serving really help with making you feel full ",positive
" i love the iced jasmine tea at our local vietnamese restaurant. in fact every vietnamese restaurant seems to serve the same wonderful tea. i have tried many different brands tyring to find one like the one served in vietnames restaurants--light in color a light tea taste and a strong jasmine taste and scent. i finally found my brand ",positive
" i disagree with the other review that this tea has an unbearable scent. i would say that the jasmine scent is strong but not overpoweringly so. if you brew it according to the producer's recommendation (steep it for 60-90 seconds) the result is good to great. the tea is very soothing and the jasmine taste is very comforting. the only knock is perhaps it leaves a little bit of an aftertaste especially when the tea is cold. i do not understand about the other reviewer's fascination with packaging a bag of tea is a bag of tea is a bag of tea. who really cares what is printed on the tab? anyways i have been drinking this tea daily and i am ready to shop for another can when this one runs out. recommended to: people looking for decent tasting white tea. not recommended to: people particularly sensitive to the scent and taste of jasmine. ",positive
" i just bought some of this golden nut crunch from planter's last week and i snack on it at work... it is really one of the best trail mixes i have had before. i love it. it lasts a while also.. it lasted me about 4 days at work just snacking on it periodically. i would definitely recommend this snack.. it's healthy too ",positive
" i love these bars! i highly recommend these for a quick breakfast on the way to work ",positive
" considering you get at least twice as much jerky per dollar than the other brands out there this is a good pick. i didn't find any grit in it. it might have a few pieces that are tougher but not really even that tough. this is a good deal ",positive
" our family loves these balls. they are very similar in taste and texture to the cheddar pirate booty maybe a little crunchier. they're by no means healthy for you but you feel a little less guilty no fake orange coloring etc. ",positive
" these cookies do not taste like they ever saw the inside of a box. they taste like real butter and fresh ingredients - and they just about melt in your mouth. i'll be buying these again ",positive
" i've tried the andy capp hot fries reg cheddar and white cheddar. these hot fries are the best. they're the best of the 3 products and best all on their own! i'm getting addicted to them (ordered a second carton before finishing the first). definitely nicely hot -- that's part of the addictive quality. and an enjoyable to eat with the good underlying corn flavor and non-greasy crispness that i like about the andy capp products ",positive
" this seller shipping was very quick and the product was perfect! i highly recommend this seller ",positive
" my wife hates hot food but for some reason loves hot fries. if her salsa has the tiniest spice she won't eat it yet these mouth-burning beasts are her favorite snack. they are sometimes hard to find - having them by the case helps solve that problem. the size offered here is the size that you will normally find (around here at least) printed with the 99c price so you can also figure the price savings somewhere around what 40%? wow ",positive
" pacific foods beef stew is wonderful for hot lunches at work inexpensively; the all organic ingredients make the pacific foods very tasty and filling! way to g ",positive
" these things are so satisfying on many levels. chewy crunchy sweet but not too just the right size with whey protein for energy which is the best source there is. all that and organic peanut butter and organic agave syrup too. i am so happy i have a whole tub of them ",positive
" these peanut butter balls not only taste great but they are good for you. my daughter has celiac disease so foods like these are really blessings in our life. i have eaten these when i did not have time for lunch. they are filling and energizing and taste delicious. you can't ask for more than that! ",positive
" let me count the ways. they're great for a quick energizing snack/ breakfast/ healthy dessert and tonight i even had one for dinner. they are delicious and you feel good about eating them because they're good for you! plus you get a lot of bang for a deceptively tiny ball... they're very filling and only about 200 calories. genius ",positive
" high quality refined balance and intriguing flavor. two thumbs up form people who like to cook ",positive
" i thought this was great but it just wasn't as competitively priced as i would have hoped for buying a case from amazon. so delicious though. when i make it for people they can't believe it's a mix ",positive
" this frosting is great! it tastes good and has a wonderful consistency if you use room temp margerine and mix for a little longer than stated. it actually tastes almost fluffy. the vanilla is good...but the chocolate is the best i've every had hands down and i have no allergies! this product is a easy and convient for those of us who have children with food allergies and all his friends enjoyed it at school ",positive
" i thought these were amazing. my favorite is the socorro blend. a review said they were soggy but i'm not sure what they mean. they are very crisp with nice and chewy fruit. despite the fruit they aren't sweet but the sweet in the fruit really balances out the hotness of the other seasoning. as for the price these are expensive nuts and high quality ingredients. the flavors are unusual but perfect. i am defiantly going to order more ",positive
" unusual and fresh tasting. i really really enjoyed these nut blends. i will definitely order them again ",positive
" sahale snacks were a pleasant surprise. they're not over-sweet nor over-hot and they've got a lot of flavor and texture. over all i'd say they're among the best snacks you can buy not only in terms of taste and freshness but because they're far healthier than a lot of the stuff you find on the grocery shelves. however the price is pretty high for the amount you get. even at the substantially reduced price of the variety pack it's a little high. however for the occasional treat it's well worth the price. it's just not the sort of snack you can dump into a bowl and pass around while watching movies ",positive
" i am ordering more of these goodies. they are not only delicious and top quality they are the most interesting assortment i have ever had and are great for my sensitive stomach too! very excellent price as well! ",positive
" i'm placing my second order for the variety pack because i liked every flavor and appreciated the variety. all have a sensational blend of flavors--spicy sweet salty--without being overpowering. truly delicious and healthy munchables. i'm so glad i decided to try out a package in my supermarket.

" what a deal! great tasting treat at a good price! i will definetly be ordering other flavors and killarney again too ",positive
" arrived in 4 days. best price i've found. flavorful coffee ",positive
" as a very frugal spender i had observed this new design of coffee making in the stores and thought the process made sense - so i was ecstatic to receive an email of a promotion one day i drove many miles to save some bucks and continue to be pleased beyond belief with every new kind of coffee we try. we didn't like the competing cheaper brands but we find douwe egbert's senseo brands consistently delicious. the flavors are subtle enough that we don't feel we're drinking a cup of chemicals. if you like strong coffee then stick to the 4 oz per pod suggestion. if that seems strong or bitter we find we can get 2 or 3 more ounces from the pod and be very pleased. for the first time in my 30 year marriage my husband doesn't make a point of commenting on the delicious coffee everytime we eat out - finally we have predictable great coffee at home. being able to serve guests their choice of tea flavors or caffeine and have everyone enjoy the first cup out is a wonderful benefit ",positive
" if you are looking for a healthy high-fiber cereal that tastes good and doesn't have too much sugar - this is it! i love this stuff ",positive
" the product is pretty good but is only 10 calories less that the optimum power which has blueberries in it. it is a healthy and fairly satisfying cereal but not my favorite ",positive
" great nutrition profile for the calories involved. the different textures make for a healthy organic snack ",positive
" the back to nature graham sticks honey are delicious! they are a great tasty snack. there's no way you can eat 'em without a cup of milk. not because they're rich but they're a little on the dry side. i still like them so much that i quit buying them at the supermarket & started buying them in bulk [... ",positive
" these are wonderful cookies! however the reason i couldn't give a full 5 stars was because so many of the boxes in the case had a lot of crumbled cookies. the boxes were not damaged in any way so i am guessing they could have been packaged that way. not cool! otherwise they are much better tasting than oreos in my opinion. i'll never go back to those ",positive
" these cookies are great. my kids love them. i saved a bundle by ordering the case. beware though i also ordered the peanut butter flavor in july06 and when they arrived at the end of july the expiration date on the case was aug06. i didn't have any problems with the classic. the expiration date was nov or dec i can't remember off hand ",positive
" my family prefers the blue agave to the lighter colored and sweeter agaves. we use it to make raw truffles (sooo good) and on top of pancakes and waffles cereal rice pudding etc. we had no problems with shipments leaking so far ",positive
" by far... the best no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels worth every penny ",positive
" because of health problems i've had to give up sugar. the agave organic sweetener in my morning cup of coffee has been a perfect substitute. i also use it with cereals and any other food or drink where i used to use sugar. thank you blue agave ",positive
" this is a great product for a mother of five. it made my mornings and some snack times wonderful. thanks ",positive
" my kids and i love the variety of cereals this assorted package has. comes with a bowl ready-to-eat in plus you can recycle the bowl ",positive
" i bought this to simplify our morning routines and save them from pouring large bowls and throwing it away. the kids loved the choices. the only downside was the portions were extremely small even for my 4 year old. on average they ate two a day ",positive
" this case offers a great variety of favorite cereals for everyone but this is not for 2 people. the cereal went stale before we could eat it but this would be great for a large family ",positive
" i recently have become more health conscious and am trying to eat more organic foods staying away from hydrogenated oils corn syrup etc. you know all the stuff that makes you fat:) this jerky is a great & healthy lowfat snack!! it tastes so amazing you'll never go back to any previously bought brand of jerky again..i love jerky and have tried many different brands..this jerky is well worth every penny and i'll keep coming back for more..thanks amazon for making it affordable ",positive
" this is the perfect tea for breakfast or any time of the day. numi's yunnan black tea has a distinctive aroma with a strong apricot top-note fortified by a nice oaky grassy base. the brewed tea flavor is clean and yet complex slightly rich. there is a an very slight edge of tannin which perfectly contrasts the subtle woodsy and floral flavors. excellent with a dash of cream. unfortunately numi does not list the amount of caffeine it contains on the box. it appears to have less caffeine than the usual english breakfast from its effect on this taster. numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging. the boxes containing their tea is made from 100% recycled paperboard from 100% post-consumer waste--they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2040 trees reduce landfill by 131200 and prevent 184000 greenhouse emissions. numi uses only 100% natural ingredients without added oils or natural flavorings ",positive
" this is the best frosting i have ever had and i don't have food allergies. i used it on the gluten free cherrybrook cupcakes and my son's teacher pulled me aside to tell me how wonderful they were. she also send people to me for the recipe. i love all the cherrybrook products but this is my favorite ",positive
" full-flavored and smooth. lingering winey aftertastes--never bitter. tolerates higher concentrations very well actually enhancing body and complexity of flavors. those who are unfamiliar with bean coffee should be reminded to use about 1/3 more by volume to get the same amount by weight as with pre-ground coffees. ",positive
" these might appease your sweet tooth while providing excellent nutrition in a 200 calorie natural food bar. they are not overly chocolately like those chocolate covered protein bars: the bar has delicious chocolate throughout with a terrific crunch of sesame flax and sunflower seeds. i'm hypoglycemic and they are perfect to keep in the car for the quick pick up to prevent the need for glucose and a true crisis. i highly recommend. oh i have ordered both from nutiva and from amazon: amazon is less expensive and faster delivery ",positive
" ***** this bedtime tea from yogi tea is an caffeine-free herbal tea that is relaxing and a natural sleep aid. bedtime tea is made from organic licorice root organic spearmint leaf organic chamomile flower organic skullcap leaf organic cardamom seed organic cinnamon bark organic st. john's wort leaf & flower organic rose hips natural orange flavor valerian root extract organic raspberry leaf organic english lavender flower stevia leaf and passion flower extract. the taste is mild delicious herb-y and very slightly sweet. it is subtle and lovely. i am definitely impressed with this tea and with yogi teas in general. bedtime tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing because it's not full of preservatives plus you can tell if it is fresh). yogi tea seems to be another company (like numi aspen traditional medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed with info about each tea they make. there is a warning on the box that this tea is not to be used during pregnancy or while nursing. if you are taking mao inhibitors or other prescription drugs you should consult your physician or health care professional before use. there are no other cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease. best of all it works...i love drinking it before bed to relax and drift off into blissful sleep. this is a great tea that i highly recommend. **** ",positive
" tastey and straong for a bag tea. it really works as a sleep aid. it does have ingredents that may aggravate sensitive people ",positive
" i highly recomend this product to those who are able to use herbal treatments. it helped me greatly in getting a more sound sleep ",positive
" there are all kinds of things that i will eat for health's sake but my husband is more taste-oriented. there are a lot of energy bars etc that he won't eat but he loves these ",positive
" my family and my healthfood store lady all say this is one of the best of betty lou's nut butter balls. i do not have any problems at all with the taste in fact it beats the heck out of the coconut ones which are extremely sweet. yes they look green in the middle but we found the taste rather clean and refreshing...not overbearing. you will also enjoy the lift in your energy level these spirulina/ginseng balls provide. now that i know about these little guys i am getting ready to buy tons for christmas gifts! we would not be without them anymore. :- ",positive
" this cereal taste delicious the chocolate pieces are not supper sweet and the chocolate is rather dark which goes well with the cereal ",positive
" we enjoyed this coffee. however decaf may still contain some caffeine. i was watching a news report about disturbed sleep studies and the medical staff at the center stated that not all caffeine is eliminated in decaf. good to know if you have trouble sleeping or with the jitters. ",positive
" this is an excellant product. cooks up very well great with any saucesmac'n cheese and also makes a fantastic macaroni salad. the price from amazon was really a bargain as all gluten free foods are so very very expensive. i just wish we didn't have to buy so many packages as storage becomes a problem ",positive
" nothing like this in the usual grocery stores. splenda-sweetened to help keep the calories down. great texture and just plain good! i want to try the other flavors soon ",positive
" the cereal is delicious. i put half of a banana in it. it is fulling for me. it is low in carbs and no sugar. i am pre-diabetic. my sugar count is very good with this. i will need them again soon ",positive
" don't think i'm weird but essentially the only thing i have at all to eat regardless of what time is nature's path cereal. the heritage collection is my favorite. wholesome filling crunchy perfect ",positive
" hearty great-tasting cereal. has a whole grain flavor. originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals (which is better for my reduced carb diet). but it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through amazon.com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores.

" this is one of my favorite cereals! it appears to be nutritionally superior to the heritage o's and less crunchy. the only downside to this cereal is that it doesn't keep me full for long. i feel like an hour later i'm hungry again. i've combated this by adding banana slices or blueberries to add some bulk to my bowl in hopes of more lasting power. an upside to the 'downside' is that this makes a terrific between meals snack! i have no problem with polishing off all six boxes in a timely manne ",positive

" these are my most favorite of all the smart monkey bars and raw bars in general. the best part is they are not dehydrated so they still have the live water content. try to stay away from too much dehydrated food. i'm an avid raw foodist. i absolutely love these. i can eat three in a row ",positive

" tin container not laced in the plasic crap.. the tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong. taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to -- not a gulper - chuckle. it was less than what i thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and i'd still have to say it's a great deal. just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important. the tins are very nice to look at and i hate to thow them away. obviously they put a lot of pride in the product ",positive
" i was a little hesitent to make a big order for so much tea not knowing if i would like it. so i went to a local supermarket and bought a tin there so i might give it a taste test. this is quite a good green tea. other than buying generic green teabags i usually buy a bancha tea. this tea is not as grassy more bold with a slight smokey taste and more of a kickiness to it. the cannisters are nice and their is an inside foil liner to keep the tea fresh. the only thing to be aware is that this is a lot of tea altogether 21 ounces divided into six separate cannisters. unless you really love this tea plan on making some gifts ",positive
" gunpowder tea is green tea most of which comes from a city named pingshui in the eastern chinese province of zhejiang south of the yangtse river delta where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the green pearl of tea. pingshui tea market records date as far back as the tang dynasty (ad 618 - 907). the area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between china and the west it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in europe. particularly during the second half of the 19th century when gunpowder tea export reached its peak its price on the london market was second only to then-popular wu yi oolong (also from china). even today zhejiang province still proudly calls itself home of silk and tea for its two primary natural products. the name gunpowder derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot. gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. it should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream ",positive
" someone told me to look on amazon to locate this product. it's great as a broth but also for gravy and jazzing up beef and poultry entrees'. the taste is out of this world and so easy to make. i inject the turkey broth into the turkey before cooking and it enhances the flavor... added bonus since the holidays are just around the corner. thank you for having this product on amazon ",positive

" the grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly i've become weary reading labels. i've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality. nature's path organic apple cinnamon toaster pastries do taste slightly healthy but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies i make that are also made with whole-wheat flour. ingredients: organic apple cinnamon filling (organic evaporated cane juice organic apple juice concentrate water organic evaporated apples vegetable glycerin organic apple powder organic corn startch organic cinnamon locust bean gum) organic whole-wheat flour organic white flour water organic evaporated cane juice organic palm oil powdered organic eveaporated cane juice organic invert syrup salt leavening natural flavor agar tocopherols (for freshness). unfortunately these do contain palm oil although i don't seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil. makes me wonder what i'm really allergic to as in what is in the additional element in the non-organic palm kernel oil. could it simply be that this is the non-hydrogenated version. could be. each pastry is 190 calories 40 calories from fat they heat up fast in the toaster and are convenient for a snack. ~the rebecca review ",positive

" granted this is not one of the better tasting cereals but when you consider that it will provide the daily recommendation of fiber in just 2/3 cup the trade-off is worthwhile. if there is an easier way to get 26 grams of fiber i haven't found it. just be aware that if you prefer sugary sweet cereals this definitely is not the one for you ",positive

" kraft macaroni and cheese beckons back to lonely days running home at lunchtime. as i lay heart-strewn and crying about the harsh rejection meted upon me by the fairest of the playground beauties soft noodles in a cheese cream sauce would ease my ache. daily at morning recess i would smile weakly and say hello to heidi who in return would grimace. there stood i in a pile of sadness swings and slides all around alone and she having moved on would toil no longer in my presence. today all so many years beyond i do not remember if it was her kickball skills or the way she whispered green eggs and ham ever so flirtatiously just within earshot. her gentle words were never meant for me no matter how i thought her eyes caught mine and with clarity at recess i was reminded of her tease. recess would pass into lunchtime and as the bell rang i blew out the door and ran the quarter mile home. anger grief all inside boiling looking to be purged pushed me homeward. second grade happiness would be found where my mom made lunch. resting on our kitchen table steaming with freshly ground pepper was the golden orange macaroni and cheese. a bit of butter and a few drops of milk converged with the cheese for the smooth-sweet-salty taste with which i could indulge my insatiated heart. my mother forever smiling and me upset at heidi who was forever guiling until soon i with my belly full was no longer riling. fair maiden was never won by macaroni and cheese but my broken heart was oft-mended by its flavor ",positive
" my kids love their macaroni & cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand. they didn't eat it all that well (kraft really is the best) so i decided to try to make it a little better for them. follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions. put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter (i melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster) and add 1/3 cup milk. what you'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that kraft sells for a lot more money. by adding extra milk and cheese they're even getting more calcium. my kids love it when i throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it's so cheesy (the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don't normally eat and make them taste good). give it a try and see what you and/or your kids think ",positive

" this cereal really tastes good. i make it in the microwave first heating the fresh cold water to boiling then adding the cereal stirring and returning it to the microwave to finish cooking. i let it boil and bubble for a bit in the microwave which is when the cooking really occurs. i often let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after it stops to set up. years ago a ham radio guy asked me (over the air!) whether i knew how to make gourmet microwave hot cereal. i said no - wondering how you could make anything gourmet especially cooked cereal in the microwave - but that i didn't express out loud... so he explained to me the above method with emphasis on heating the cold water before adding the cereal. and definitely not using hot tap water as that has the o2 chased out of it or some such. so i guess that must be it! i used to laboriously mix various cereal grains to achieve this kind of mix but with this product it is all done for me. it's also good with raisins added. i'm delighted that amazon is selling some of these healthy food items that are hard to find in parts of the country. the special offers bring the price within reason.

" i discovered nature's path organic heritage flakes cereal while i stayed in seattle wa for almost 6 months in the year 2000. i fell in love with it: wholesome good taste and organic. back in los angeles i had difficulty finding it in traditional health food stores. last october i received an e-mail from [...] offering food items among them my beloved cereal. right away i order 6 bags each of 32 oz. i received it a few days after and ever since i feel very happy to get back to this wonderful combination of cereals. besides that i'm getting economies of scale with the 32 oz compared to the 13 oz box i used to buy at the health food stores. ",positive
" this cereal meets three major criteria: 1. it is low in sugar - no longer a kid and hate cereal that is too sweet. 2. stays crunchy - the best flaked cereal i have found for staying crunchy in milk maybe because the flakes seem a little heartier/thicker than standard flakes. 3. taste - last but not least too many of the healthier flakes taste like cardboard but this cereal is so good i can eat it right out of the bag like a snack. this cereal is one item in my ultimate breakfast cereal mix. the other ingredients are kashi's 7 whole grain puffs dried cranberries pecans and flax seed. with heritage & kashi combined you get all the following grains in one breakfast: 1. spelt 2. quinoa 3. kamut 4. millet 5. buckwheat 6. triticale 7. rye 8. red winter wheat 9. barley 10. oats 11. brown rice 12. sesame seeds then i add the following to the bowl: 13. flax seeds - about a tablespoon 14. pecans - about 2 tablespoons 15. dried cranberries - about 2 tablespoons then if you really want to go full-on healthy try better than milk original flavor vegan soy beverage the best soy milk out there...see my review of it.

" this lady grey loose tea is a sensory experience. it is light and citrusy with just the right kick of caffeine. the flower petals are pretty but i cannot taste any difference they might make in the steeped tea. it would make a nice gift for a woman who you don't know very well. all in all it is worth a try ",positive
" lady grey is practically the only tea my family and i drink. first we bought it because of cornflowers which are kinda symbol of russia where i was born but we stayed with it for the taste. try it cold with lemon - it's amazing ",positive
" i can't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea. the bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary. the color and aroma are just lovely making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery. i carry the bagged variety everywhere i go ",positive
" if you havn't tried lady grey try it and then buy the loose leaf at this price. you won't regret it. this is one of the best everyday teas i've found with a healthy dash of citrus and a flowery finish with no cloying flavors it really is a good all around tea for any time of the day. buying it on amazon saves a lot of time trying to find it in stock and it arrived faster than the books i ordered at the same time ",positive

" **** this kava stress relief tea from yogi tea is for anxiety relief. it's an unusual tea slightly sweet (it contains stevia) and very carob-y. the good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive. the bad news is that i can't feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea although it does say that there are 78mg of kava root extract in the tea. still it's a lovely cup of tea and relaxing because it just tastes good. i can also taste the spiciness of the tea which is very pleasant. i usually brew two bags in one cup which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect; however i even tried four bags once but still didn't notice a relaxing effect. i am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway so this is something to be aware of. your experience of the tea may be different. kava stress relief tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing because it's not full of preservatives plus you can tell if it is fresh) and has many organic ingredients. the ingredients in kava stress relief tea are: kava root extract carob pod indian sarsaparilla root organic cinnamon bark organic ginger root organic cardamom seed stevia leaf barley malt natural hazelnut flavor natural cinnamon flavor and natural licorice flavor. amazingly i can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea. i would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness. yogi tea seems to be another company (like numi aspen traditional medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed with info about each tea they make. their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like your breath is the voice of your soul and your head must bow to your heart. yogi tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: kava stress relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress anxiety and minor pain as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys. a member of the peppercorn family kava (piper methysticum) is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety. kava-kava native to oceania and the south pacific islands has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind and encourage a good night's sleep. a powerful antispasmodic this herb promotes a state of relaxed unconcern while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately. furthermore kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms.* the herb research foundation (2000) indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety stress restlessness muscle tension and mild pain. for added flavor our formula has been complemented with stevia sarsaparilla and organic carob. enjoy a warm soothing cup of kava stress relief a delicious way to relax. in addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease there is a warning on the box ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems frequently use alcoholic beverages or are taking any medication. stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems (e.g. unexplained fatigue abdominal pain loss of appetite fever vomiting dark urine pale stools yellow eyes or skin). not for use by persons under 18 years of age or by pregnant or breastfeeding women. not for use with alcoholic beverages. excessive use or use with products that cause drowsiness may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment. note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe. however i am not a physician and if you have any health concerns you should check with an appropriate professional. i decided to give kava stress relief tea four stars since it didn't really work for me. still it is a wonderful and recommended tea and may work for you! *** ",positive
" is very similar to raspberry teas found at your favorite eateries. we found it necessary to drink with our sweetener. a refreshing drink but has a slight after taste to it maybe making this tea in large quantity is what did it (4 qts). i would have rated a 5 but taste was a little off. ",positive
" economical way to purchase a cold brew tea that has natural flavoring. easy to make and tastes great. no guilt with this drink ",positive
" these teas (both the raspberry and the blueberry) are priced lower than in the grocery store ($3.49 per individual box) where they are usually a seasonal item. this is frustrating since my husband and i are hooked on them and probably brew and drink a full pitcher per day. they are the best tasting cold ice teas and great for the antioxidant benefits. this seller shipped them promptly and they were very well packed. we will be a repeat buyer for sure. a+!!!!!!!!!!!

" i really like this cereal by nature's path... it is very good and tasty. however i just found a new favorite which is the zen version with cranberries and ginger. i highly recommend both of them though. the optimum has more fiber and has a completely different taste then the zen so if you need to change it up go for this one too ",positive
" this optimum power breakfast cereal contains wheat oats barley soy flaxseeds and something nature's path calls kamut which look like puffed oats. also there are freeze-dried blueberries a few anyway and a delightful subtle cinnamon flavor hits you. the ingredient list contains a few other things that are probably good for you. now the third ingredient in the 16-ingredient list - and these lists are supposed to be in order according to percentage with the largest first - is something called organic evaporated cane juice. now what is that but organic sugar? this probably accounts for the cereal being somewhat sweet as another reviewer noted. but it is nowhere near as sweet as those tooth-decaying empty-caloried mass-marketed cereals most americans are feeding their children. no this cereal is well within the tolerance of us granolas who don't dowse everything with sugar ketchup and supermarket mayonnaise. (no i don't mean on cereal. just making a point.) so when you pour this out of the box you see a lot of extruded elongated brown rod-shaped thingies quite a few healthy-looking chubby flakes some of those exploded oat-looking morsels that are probably the kamuts and here and there a desiccated blueberry. gawd when i get started writing like this i can't stop i just get more so. better not review anything else tonight. you'll never want to eat this. actually my description of the thingies could have been far more graphic and devilish. you'll see. please do try this cereal you'll like the heartiness the cinnamoniness (new word?) and the relatively light sweetness. i did give it five stars didn't i ",positive

" these cookies are superb all by themselves. far superior to that other sandwich cookie in every way. but if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence melt some ghirardelli double chocolate chips in your double boiler and dip these cookies then remove to a rack to dry. your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store and beg you for more. keep out of reach of children ",positive
" these high-sodium ginger cookies are too tasty to have around - you'll easily surpass your rda of sodium in one sitting. the nutrition facts that amazon neglected to post are: serving size is 2 cookies (28 g). each serving has 160 mg of sodium 4.5 mg of fat (2 g saturated 0 g transfat) 19 g of total carbs (10 g sugars) and 0 g of cholesterol. the ingredients in these made in u.s.a. cookies are organic unbleached wheat flour powdered sugar organic palm fruit oil organic molasses organic sugar sodium bicarbonate (leavening) ground ginger soy lecithin (an emulsifier) salt monocalcium phosphate (leavening) and nutmeg. there are no hydrogentated oils or trans fats. on the back of the package is an ode to ginger-o's which reads: you might m'lady tweak my nose. you could m'lord step on my toes. but heaven help those poor bozos who try to filch my ginger-o's . again these high-sodium cookies taste too good in order to effectively exercise self-discipline to limit the quantity eaten.

" now one of the reviewers of this product complained about the sugar content of this cereal by only looking at the ingredients list which is not how to determine the nutritional value of any product (especially when the reviewer cannot distinguish between nutritive and non-nutritive ingredients). this cereal has just as many simple sugars as frosted flakes but the cereal does not claim to be low in sugar. what's important about this cereal is that it offers quite a bit of fiber and vitamins/minerals (not as much as some cereals but since i have no deficiencies in this area i didn't mind). also it only has 3 times the salt of a half cup of milk which is not loaded. a can of healthy choice soup now that is loaded with salt. now i chose this cereal as a replacement for frosted flakes/honey nut cheerios which against my better judgment i continued to have every morning. i should point out that i don't drink coffee in the mornings and i don't drink soda (less than 1 a week on average). i also eat no sweets. simple sugars (listed as just sugars on the nutrition label) seem to be treated like carcinogens while most people don't realize that aspartame (artificial sweetener in most diet sodas) really is one. if your diet is already low in sugar and you feel confident you can burn through those sugars pretty quick (since i don't drink caffeinated drinks i need that jolt in the morning) then this is a good choice. if your diet already has quite a bit of sugar or your doctor tells you to cut down on simple sugars (or you also have a couple of cups of caffeinated coffee with sugar every morning) then go with another bran cereal without the oat clusters and syrups (which i really do not like that much). also if you are concerned about the total carbs please note that a normal 2000 calories diet would include about 300g of carbohydrates (so yes high protein diets contradict this). since taste is completely subjective i won't put much emphasis on it. in my opinion it tastes pretty good (but i don't consume many sweets during the day).

" these should not be confused with dessert. as the name states these are a breakfast cookie originally developed for people in a hurry who do not stop for a cooked meal. this variety has chocolate chunks but is not a chocolate cookie. other varieties are available. cookie varieties are based on the original recipe. they are available in the full 3 ounce size or as mini-cookies. they have a good nutritional balance. they do have an expiration date. like all bakery products they do not stay fresh forever. as other reviewers have warned you need to check the expiration date especially if you are not buying them direct from the bakery. day old bread is also sold at bargain prices but you get day old bread. i found that the fresh cookies are yummy and they do fill you up. i would recommend them for your travel bags (better than airline food which has often been reduced to yucky box lunches) for your desk drawer if you get busy and have to skip lunch or for a convenient trail food if you are hiking. i used the rocky road variety (seasonal special) in christmas stockings and the pumpkin variety (seasonal special) in halloween bags ",positive
" these things are great...i love baker's breakfast cookies. this flavor is pretty darn good too big chunks of chocolate and lots of flavor. doesn't taste fake at all. i prefer a couple other flavors more but this is definately a winner. these cookies taste like a treat but are really healthy for you. they will fill you up for hours especially with a glass of water juice or milk to wash it down ",positive
" these cookies are a nice break from the run-of-the-mill granola bar. based on oatmeal not too sweet filling. great value. i would purchase again ",positive
" this is a nice tea. not bitter i don't need any honey or sweetner at all. i'll be getting more of this for sure ",positive
" without a doubt this is the easiest buttermilk buscuit mix i've ever used. super simple...super fast! you won't be sorry you bought this ",positive
" i recently decided to give these diedrich k-cups a whirl. for years i've been a dedicated green mountain coffee roaster customer and their k-cup varieties are excellent; however even at their cafe express discount rate their coffees are more expensive by several dollars per 25 count pack than the current price amazon is offering on diedrich blends. i'd been traveling in southern california a few months ago and tried some diedrich coffees then. although the coffees i tried tended to exhibit the starbucks/west coast tendency to roast beans too darkly -- to the point of effacing some of the original regional characteristics of the beans -- they are fine for dark roasts and preferable to what i've had from starbucks. coupled with the keurig brewer this makes for a decent cup of medium-to-dark west coast style coffee ",positive
" my mother absolutely loves this tea it's the only kind she will use. i received a container of it in a gift basket and called bentley to find out where i could purchase more and they told me they don't sell to the public. my mom was very upset... i then went on to amazon (which was great for all my christmas shopping) who put me in touch with bently so my mother had a wonderful christmas!!!

" what other food is 120 calories (only 25 from fat)and 5 grams of fiber or 20% of your daily value? an ideal breakfast or snack... just one fills you up a lot. and i must stress that they are delicious ",positive
" these cereal bars by kellogg's are the best! well actually at first i wasn't that sure. it's rare to see a cereal bar on the grocery shelf that actually has 20 % of your daily requirement for fiber in just one bar! i was very impressed by that claim and so i brought a box home to try it out. these cereal bars are tasty and quite easy to chew on when you're in need of a quick breakfast or snack that has some health quality to it. they aren't that expensive either. moreover there are no trans fats although there is a very very slight amount of partially hydrogenated oils in the bar. these cereal bars contain some vitamins too which is always a plus. however one caveat: be careful if you have any allergies to wheat soy milk and/or almonds. stay away unless your doctor tells you it's ok to have this food. highly recommended! enjoy! smiles ",positive
" i don't like plain coffee but even more i don't need or like all the calories and fat that come with using flavored coffee creamers. even the sugar-free creamers have a ton of fat part of which is hydrogenated/partially hydrogenated. flavor blends for coffee are a wonderful alternative to fatty creamers. easy to use and they come in portable small packages you can take with you anywhere. this is not a creamer but more a flavored sugar. one packet gives a yummy subtle hazelnut flavor but without being too sweet the way some things with splenda are. ",positive
" my mom first sent my husband a box in his care package - he is stationed north of baghdad iraq - and it was the best thing he had ever received. being in the army for 24 years he has had his share of bad coffee but he doesn't have to have wake up to that anymore. i sent him another six boxes of the hazelnut mocha and french vanilla. he says the hazelnut is his but he shares the rest. it is a big hit with his unit and all have commented on the awesome taste and that the army coffee is significantly improved! we won't allow him to run out a box or two are added to every care package my mom and i send. nothing but the best for the troops ",positive
" this is a pretty good splenda flavor but the mocha is best in my opinion. the french vanilla is a second favorite. hazelnut is better than no flavor at all. i use one flavored packet and one regular splenda packet in a large (14 oz) mug and it's perfect. not necessary to use two flavored ones as it is a little pricey and one has enough flavor for an entire travel mug ",positive
" ever since i have tried this producti eat some everyday!! it is the perfect blend of savory tangy sweet and a touch spicy. i know that sounds like a weird combo but its sooo good addicting even. i initially bought this prouct at a local natural and whole foods store but amazon .com has the lowest price i've seen anywhere and u cant beat free shipping!! it's so conveniant. i have ordered this product from amazon several times and i must mention one order contained multiple expired items that were definitely stale tasting so i let customer service know and they immediately responded and very pleasantly resolved the matter to my satisfaction. i do suggest the multiple 12 2 oz multiple pack only because this blend is so yummy portion control is helpful!!

" my local sam's club discontinued the nature's path maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal due to lack of sales. i was bummed and did not want to resort to the highly processed quaker instants - ick! not to mention i'm tired of all the junk ingredients in mainstream food nowadays. then i remembered amazon selling a lot of easily shippable bulk foods - including organics! :-) the nature's path oatmeal absorbs water much better and the texture is heartier than other leading brands. it is also very flavorful. the variety pack is nice since i used to tire of the sam's club selection of maple and brown sugar only. my kids love steel cut oats with a little pure maple syrup but it's not the most convenient breakfast food. the nature's path instant oatmeal is quick and easy during the busy weekday mornings. and best of all i can understand the ingredients label without having to take a chemistry refresher class. i'm very satisfied with my first organic purchase from amazon. we now peruse the selection of organic foods on amazon before making local purchases ",positive
" most grocery store variety oatmeals have fillers and are from the rolled oats variety. the best tasting and most nutritious oatmeal comes from steel cut oats but it is a chore to cook. you have to cook it very slowly and watch it carefully as it will easily boil over all over the place. i was astounded to find instant organic steel cut oats at my local costco. you simply open a packet into a bowl add boiling water from your kettle or microwave and stir. there are many flavors to suit your moods. all of them are delicious in my opinion. try this and you will agree. my costco stopped carrying this brand so i found it here on amazon. apparently there were many requests at costco and they have now decided to again carry this brand. it is cheaper at my costco. $8.35 for 32 packets and 53.6 ounces. you can't beat this for a quick breakfast ",positive
" this tastes and looks like the real thing (wheat/semolina) my kids can't tell the difference. i'm not wasting my time sampling all of the others now. ",positive
" these are great... take a little longer to cook than wheat spaghetti and you must strain them but other than that you cant tell any difference ",positive
" i liked this so much i gave some as gifts to friends (before i polished it all off). i am better able to stick with reasonable and healthy portions at my evening meal if i can look forward to a little treat later in the evening. i serve it in a small cup that will hold a third of a box. satisfying and healthy what a deal ",positive
" i tried most of jack links' products. i will classified this one as good...but i personally prefer beef nuggets since it tasted juicier. ",positive
" these do taste almost like the biscuits at red lobster. they are so easy to make and so delicious! i have a muffin maker and they cook perfectly in about 10 minutes ",positive
" we bought this bulk box because we drink a lot of tea...it's a great bargain if you're a tea drinker!!! :) ",positive
" this is mine and my husbands favorite tea. it has such a smooth satisfying taste. we have tried about all the earl grey teas and this is the best. we can't always find it. so when i found it on amazon i was elated. being able to buy it in the 50-count boxes (pack of 6) was just what we were looking for. and we will continue to buy it here..thanks amazon ",positive
" these colombian d'ordado pods work well in my krups home cafe machine. the overall flavor is good. i do like my coffee a little stronger so i use 2 of these pods and the two-6 ounce cup setting for a nice big mug of morning coffee ",positive
" this is a very good value. i use it to put in many asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth. the result is a more authentic asian taste to my recipes ",positive
" we ordered 4 jars and love it. it has great flavor and is on the spicy side. it is easily frozen in the plastic containers. the 20 oz size is just about perfect for our family of 5 ",positive
" i ordered this sauce which is very good and very spicy. the only drawback is that when i opened the package one jar had cracked and leaked (a real mess). amazon sent a replacement and the same thing happened because they were not shrink wrapped first. they were loose in the box with just some bubble wrap ",positive
" typical of central italy this sauce has the characteristic of being hot after all arrabbiata means mad in italian. although tolerance to spiciness is very subjective this sauce will not overwhelm your palate. enjoy this beautiful blend of flavors: the freshness of parsley a hint of hand picked organic marjoram and the madness of the habanero. recipe suggestions: excellent as a dip for shrimp or chips; spicy and delicious over tacos quesadillas or any mexican dish. unexpectedly delicious over chicken cutlet or poached fish grilled vegetables au gratin or sauted portabella mushroom! we've also added it to a seafood bouillabaisse for a fantastic dinner party idea. ",positive
" i love this mac & cheese. it has all of the comfort food aspects of easy mac (warm and gooey orange cheese) but without that vague chemical aftertaste. it tastes so cheddar cheesey and is wonderful to keep on hand for those days when there is just no food in the fridge (you don't even need to add milk to this!). my favorite comfort food when i'm sick ",positive
" annie's homegrown deluxe shells & real aged wisconsin cheddar is the best mac-n-cheese straight out of the box i ever tasted. kids and grown-ups agree. a note to the other reviewers- don't try to ruin my mac-n-cheese comfort food experience with your cardboard tastin' whole wheat pasta and no salt sauce. if you're so inclined to have it just how you would make it go ahead and make your own. it's just mac-n-cheese after all. ",positive
" my children and i agree: this is the best tasting mac and cheese on the market. this is a great price too... about 1.30 a box less than i usually pay. when kids are eating several boxes a week that adds up quickly. i do agree with the other reviewer about the ways this mac and cheese could be even closer to perfection. but i have one child who is very careful about what she will and will not eat and for her this product is a gift. highly recommended ",positive

" shipping was fast and cherries were great.the best dried cherries we have bought ",positive
" i do not understand the bad reviews of this product. they smelled great had a nice texture and tasted like a dried cherry should. they did not clump at all like many dried fruits out there do. they also did not taste like cardboard or were dried like nasa space food like some of the dried fruit out there does. i use these in my tea i chop them up and toss in my vanilla ice cream and i eat them straight out of the bag. these are the best dried cherries i have ever eaten ",positive
" the price was great it arrived quickly and it was exactly what i ordered. great deal and great service ",positive
" this is an all-time favorite tea of mine. i spend hundreds of dollars a year on tea - and this tea really hits the spot in my favorite top ten list of teas. the only downfall about this tea is that it is not made with strings. i like to have strings on my bags of tea. but no matter what this is the best peppermint tea i've ever drank! celestial seasonings is a great brand. this tea will smell up your kitchen with a lovely invigorating scent. perfect for the mornings. i also use this tea when my stomach is upset if my joints are sore to help with cramps and to help with gas! peppermint is a natural reliever for ibs especially if you have the flu or a bad cold peppermint tea really seems to bring up your spirits and relieve stomach irritations ",positive
" this is celestial seasonings at their best-a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea! peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet clean taste. peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. it is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. peppermint combats flatulence promotes bile flow and digestive juices and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion. it is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle. celestial seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. it keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. the art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface ",positive
" i am a devoted earl grey tea drinker and have enjoyed earl grey tea all over the world. ahmad tea has been my favorite for years. i'm so pleased to be able to obtain it through amazon. i used to have to carry it by the suitcaseful back from london to stock up ",positive
" i bought select items to include with other items in gift bags for christmas. the ahmad selection teas make two excellent cups per bag. everyone receiving the tea commented on the fine quality of the product. highly recommended! ",positive
" i use this mostly in my coffee and tea and find that it adds a kind of sweetness that i enjoy. i've had others try it and some have liked it as much as i do and others said it wasn't for them. i remember reading years ago that stevia has a slight licorice taste to it but i don't detect any of that sort of taste at all. my online research leads me to believe that that might have something to do with inulin fiber (fos) thats also a part of this sweetener. i tried splenda and didn't like it. everyone's tastes and body chemistry are different but if you're looking to reduce the amount of sugar in your diet without feeling like you are suffering for it then give this a try ",positive
" i had been using sweetleaf before buying it at the local super market health food section. buying here is around a 50% savings. this product works so great at sweetening with no better after taste. i just love that it is a natural product ",positive
" i've been using sweetleaf steviaplus for about 3 weeks now and i'm so glad i decided to try it. i was worried about the research coming out about aspartame; and splenda... well it just does terrible things to my stomach. i simply can't use it. so i started doing some web-searching and learned about stevia. i liked the fact that it was natural and used extensively in other countries such as japan. but i still kept my expectations low... it sounded too good to be true and i figured it would taste awful. i ordered sweetleaf steviaplus and to my surprise and delight i love the taste. it's sweet and no bitterness. now i'm a person who is used to using artificial sweeteners so someone who uses only sugar might have a different opinion but i did share it with a coworker to use in his tea and he really liked it as well. so don't be afraid to try it if you haven't already. i notice that i'm feeling a lot better lately. maybe it's the switch from artificial sweeteners to stevia. at any rate i'm happy with it and i recently placed another order for both packets and tablets ",positive

" twinings was founded in london england in 1706 and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. the history of darjeeling tea goes back to the 1840s when dr. campbell a civil engineer planted tea seeds in his garden at beechwood darjeeling. the result was a nice light tea with excellent color and aroma. darjeeling tea gained a considerable following and is now highly prized as the champagne of teas! ok let's get down to brass tacks - this is an excellent tea produced by a great company and a tea i will never be without. the tea has an excellent aroma and flavor and is harder to over-steep than some other teas that i have known. also something of a surprise is the fact that this tea tastes at least as good iced as it does hot! as such year round you will find me making twinings' darjeeling tea. so here's the bottom line: if you want a tea that is excellent hot and cold then darjeeling is for you. if you want tea from a great tea producer then twinings is for you. if you want the best tea in the world then buy twinings' darjeeling tea ",positive

" adding another italian classic to our product line puttanesca comes from the expression puttanaio which to put it modestly translates into a lot of things going on at the same time. the rich combination of flavors: garlic black olives capers and fresh herbs come from the tradition of southern regional cooking. recipe suggestions: use it over pasta or to add some spice to chicken fish...or your relationship - just heat and serve or bake it in. try mixing it in with scrambled eggs rolled in pita bread for a brunch alternative! the favorite? grill or pan sear swordfish and pour it on. ",positive
" this pasta is very good. it works great in salads casseroles or regular pasta dishes. i've only been gluten free for a few months and i think this tastes very similar to wheat pasta. granted i've only tried one other kind of gluten-free pasta (made all of brown rice) but this pasta is far better and i like it enough that i feel no need to keep shopping around and trying other kinds ",positive

" dried fruit? the point of debate here is dried fruit. these are delicious; i ate many many handfuls each serving. their more like gum drops because of the sugar added by infusion. i'm suprised that the oil does not factor into the flavor at all. not a typical dried fruit. highly reccomended!!

" wished i had read the nutritional facts before i bought this as 100/120 calories per serving are fat; 5 serving to a jar therefore 500 calories of fat in one 20 ounce jar. ouch. good thing i work out as i can afford that from time to time. having said that this does taste pretty good although i have had better when i have eaten out at good cafes. taste is 4 stars for me. i paired this with canned sockeye salmon and rotini and it made for a quick and good meal. note that the sauce is pinker in color than the picture on my monitor. overall good enough to make me want to try some on their other mixtures. edit: forced to update this as i later discovered one of the jars had developed a hairline crack and started leaking in storage. this makes the 3rd order of products from this company that has developed leaking problems. i won't purchase this company's products again not because of the taste but because of the leakage issues ",positive

" first i'd like to say that many of nana's cookies are most delicious and i've tried most of the flavors. my favorites tend to be this one and the chocolate coconut chip. as one of the other reviewers pointed out you have to have a particular palate to enjoy this type of cookie. for those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions...vegan sugar substitutes etc. these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we've been led to believe we want. thanks nana's for the natural foodie options ",positive
" the chocolate crunch is my favorite of the gluten-free nana's cookies though the lemon is pretty good too. i have a feeling the person who gave these 1 star is someone who can eat a freakin' cinnabon if she wants to. for those of us who have dietary restrictions it's a different story. it does take a while to get used to gluten free fare but these cookies are among the best i've had which is pretty impressive since they don't even have sugar in them. and the fact that they don't have gluten eggs nuts or dairy in them either is wonderful (yes there are those of us out there allergic to all these things). i just wish more stores carried them. but now that i've found them on amazon i'll be ordering in bulk. ; ",positive
" i used to have a hard time getting my kids to eat fruit until we tried the just tomatoes products. now i have a hard time getting them not to eat the whole tub in one sitting. to have a picky eater eat all the fruits from this company is amazing to me. i love them too great for a quick low calorie healthy snack ",positive

" this is the best tasting shredded (= dessicated) coconut i have found anywhere in the usa. it is organic and sulfite free. this is the unsweetened finely shredded very small pieces of dessicated coconut which is used in south east asia australia etc. this is not the same product as american style coconut of which the most common type is baker's sweetened angel flake coconut. i like to buy finely shredded/dessicated coconut because i often bake australian british and european style cakes and cookies which do not work well when made with flake coconut. i have also discovered that finely shredded coconut can be used to make your own coconut milk or coconut cream at home. flake coconut and dessicated coconut have a different taste and texture. a cup of sweetened angel flake coconut has about 2 tablespoons of sugar added to it so it is very sweet compared to shredded/dessicated coconut which has no added sugar at all. the shredded/dessicated coconut is drier and the pieces are very small compared to the flakes so it has more surface area. because of these two things 8oz of dessicated coconut will absorb more liquid than 8oz of flake coconut. some recipes will work quite well with either kind of coconut but others will not even if you compensate for the sugar and liquid. its better especially for baking to use whatever the recipe originally calls for. the coconut i received from amazon tasted very fresh and had a good use by date. if you want to increase the shelf life of the coconut throw the bags into the freezer or the refrigerator. they will keep there a year. once a bag is opened i always keep it in the refrigerator. i don't like buying this kind of coconut from health food stores as it often comes in bulk bins and has been exposed to the air. unsweetened organic coconut can get stale or even develop a rancid taste if it is stored open to the air. the sweetened flake coconut is much more stable because it contains preservatives and sugar. if you are an australian wanting to make things like lamingtons or coconut ice you need to use dessicated/finely shredded cooconut. flake coconut will not give the right results. dessicated/finely shredded coconut is also excellent for replicating those little coconut macaroon cookies that you find in many chinese buffet restaurants. shredded/dessicated coconut can be mixed with water to make your own coconut milk or coconut cream. i find this is useful because i rarely use more than 1/2 a can when i cook with coconut milk (curries soups laksa etc). sometimes i only want a spoonful or two to add a little flavor to a smoothie or a banana cake. i have tried making coconut milk from flake coconut but for my taste it was way too sweet and did not have a good texture. to make coconut milk from dessicated coconut: method 1. put equal parts of coconut and hot water by weight into a blender (eg 8oz coconut to 1 cup of hot water). whizz in the blender for a minute or two. if desired you can strain and press it through a cloth or a fine sieve when it has cooled down. this is not necessary for most recipes unless you require a silky smooth texture for the end product. for a lighter coconut milk use 8oz of coconut to one and a half cups of water or you can use lite shredded coconut to start with. method 2. simmer equal parts by weight of coconut with hot water until froth appears. do not boil. remove from heat and let it sit until it cools down. if desired you can strain it through a cloth bag or a very fine sieve pressing out as much liquid as possible. to make a thick coconut cream from dessicated coconut: use either method above but use 4 parts of coconut to one part of water. i thought the price from amazon was excellent especially for an organic product. at the time of purchase it worked out at one dollar forty two cents per 8oz bag and in my case shipping was free. i can't find organic dessicated coconut anywhere else at this price. overall i was very pleased with the taste freshness price and quality of this coconut. i don't think that i will have any problems using up the 12 packets in one year especially as i won't be buying any cans of coconut milk.

" i use plenty of this product regularly when making ice cream cookies cakes etc... i find that this product has a sort of natural sweetness or flavor on its own. because of this much less added sugar is needed in baked goodies and in some cases added sugar is eliminated. to obtain this i use this organic unsweetened coconut in combination with organic whole milk.

" these are the perfect snack for on the go. actual real fruit--no sugar! no roll-ups with 10% fruit! they are not dry or leathery and even little kids can chew them well. just the right size for toddlers and small kids (and moms too). great to stick in the diaper bag or purse for an impromptu healthy snack. works in any weather (won't melt) and even survives at the bottom of the purse! comes in lots of flavors an organic version and bigger bars too for a bigger snack. cheaper than lesser products at the grocery store. great!

" this is a delicately flavored not too sweet treat. just the right thing for that mid morning coffe break and indivdully packaged for convenient transportation to work ",positive
" the taste is ok but not great. the one thing about this that is somewhat annoying is that it's a two serving packet which means that it makes 16 ounces for liquid. i really only want to eat up 8 ounces at a time. that means i have to guess how much is half and then roll up the bag to save the remaining portion. even if i did want to eat the entire packet i don't have a bowl that is 16 ounces (and all my bowls are perfectly normal sized). the bottom line here is that there is nothing wrong with the taste of the soup (still i'm not in love with it). i just wish there was a better way of packaging. i'm the only one eating it and maybe that affects my opinion. if you have more than one person in your family then it won't be a problem at all and you can ignore everything i've said.

" this is a great alternative to chicken soup if you get sick. it will alkalinize you blood and help to get better much faster than you would normally do. also try it in the morning instead of your regular cup of java - it will perk you up without the jitters of caffeine. true it has a lot of solium but this sodium is from sea salt that brings with it much needed trace minerals. the seaweed veriety is the best. open minded and adventurous folks will love it right away for others it may take some time to get used to. do try. your body will thank you ",positive

" i am a no coffee drink tea all the time person. i have tried so many teas and am constantly interested in trying new ones. this has to be the most wonderful green tea out there!! it is wonderful!!! ",positive
" i love this tea! it is very refreshing and has a wonderful aroma. it doesn't get bitter like other green teas. once i tried this green tea this was the only one for me. ",positive
" i am addicted to this green tea! it has the smell of passion fruit. i have to have at least 1-2 cups a day. great buy. can't find it at all stores and it cost half the price on amazon ",positive
" these are my husbands favorite thing to eat. thank you for making available at such a great discoun ",positive
" i recieved the variety pack today and tried this flavor first. i buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar) but i find them bland. so i ordered these and i love them. in fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. you can tell they used hot spices but they are very well done so as to not be too much. the nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy. there is about equal of both nuts and fruit. they do use evaporated cane juice and organic tapioca syrup but these are healthier than alternatives and there are still only 5 grams of sugar per 1/4 cup serving ",positive
" the product if reviewed just on taste would only warrant a two but the convenience is worth a five. it is probably the best la briute product that i have found. it is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable but it is way too salty ",positive
" unlike the december 2006 review and much like the most recent reviews there's not much in this soup other than very small bits of seafood and some potato. i'm thinking that 1) the recent quality has gone downhill or 2) the december 2006 review was a plant. anyway the taste was okay but it definitely doesn't rate up there with legal seafood (which i've had at one of the restaurants and at the boston airport both much better than this) ",positive
" i love soups and stews and i am in love with this seafood chowder. it's the absolute best flavor and chock full of a variety of seafood. the taste is great!! i've tried many many chowders and this ranks the highest of any i have ever eaten....even legal seafood's or wolfgang puck's or several local massachsetts seaside restaurants. and it's all natural with no artificial ingredients. i recommend this to everyone who loves seafood and chowders. of all the baxter soups and chowders this is really the only one i recommend everyone try. i repeat...it's great!! it is a bit high in salt though.....~1400 mg/can but if this is the only salty food eaten all day...it's ok. try it....it's heavenly! ",positive
" this is the best home style sushi kit. you get the basics excellent rice sushi wrap sheets & soy sauce. i made these & added thin sliced cucumber & smoked salmon in the rolls as i assembled them. the best!!!! the possibilities are endless!!!! try it & you'll see. sometime i can be all thumbs but this was very easy & the quality of the food was excellent ",positive
" quite tasty! no flavorings in the rice but still a very nice light lunch. can be a bit messy for those of us who are not skilled sushi roll wrappers. i was planning on making this a regular part of my pantry but see that the price has just gone up changing it from a good value to not enough food for the money.if the price goes down i'll buy it again but not for 15 dollars a six pack ",positive
" these are a definite time saver with a couple of faults which another reviewer pointed out -- no flavorings in the rice nori cut too small. to get around the rice problem just add a little rice vinegar and sugar to the rice and it comes out quite good. i don't particularly like wasabi but they should probably add a packet to the box for those who do. the nori sheets taste good and fresh if maybe slightly salty for my tastes. as stated before though they are definitely cut way too small. you cannot achieve any kind of decent looking roll with them but if you aren't picky about what the finished product looks like and if you pack any added ingredients pretty thin you can get it to hold together long enough to eat it. bottom line is for the ten bucks i paid for 6 packages i'd say it is a definite winner for 6 cheap fast lunches that taste much better than they look. i can't eat one sushi roll at a local sushi bar for less than 8 to 10 bucks. now that the price for these has gone up a little i'd probably consider just buying the larger size annie chun precooked sticky rice containers (if amazon gets them back in stock) and providing my own full size nori sheets. ",positive
" to get you through to your next meal. my children and i love this flavor and it really tastes like peanut butter ",positive
" pretty good. solid peanut butter taste and no digestive problem. i enjoyed them for hiking and biking. i don't recommend them near water because when wet they taste not so good. good snack for kids when hungry and its better for them then sugarly things. ",positive
" my husband loves ensavor garlic chicken stew. he loves the taste the convenience and the fact that it is made for diabetics. my husband is pre-diabetic and is on a medically supervised diet for his condition. he keeps ensavor in his office for lunch in his briefcase for meals out with clients and takes it with him when he travels. it's a great product. ",positive
" i just finished up my first bag of this coffee it's great. i normally buy starbucks breakfast blend just so you know for comparisons purpose- but i am switching to this brand. it's just the perfect blend for me smooth but strong enough to wake me up. ",positive
" when mini-wheats first came out in the grocery store i tried them. however i found they were bland. it was like trying to eat sticks in milk. then came frosted mini-wheats. okay i decided to give it a go. now i had sticks and sugar in milk. however i did find out that if you forego the milk and just eat them straight from the box like potato chips they are excellent! now kellogg's has added fruity flavors to the mini-wheat. these i can eat in milk! yippee! finally! i picked up the strawberry delight in bite size. even though i can eat them in milk i find that i still prefer just to eat them straight from the box like potato chips a type of chex-mix or square wheat thin snack. each serving has 140 calories. compare that to other cereals and you'll see it is about 60 - 100 calories less. no saturated fat. no trans fat. no cholesterol. no sodium. total fat is only 0.5g according to the box. i don't see how since zero and zero is well zero. but i can live with 0.5g. here is the bad news the carbohydrates. there are 35g of carbs here. but that is about the same as all the other brands. diabetics may want to pass on this due to the 10g of sugar per serving. and remember a single serving is about the size of half a base ball. not much. so if you are just pouring cereal into a cereal bowl without measuring you are probably getting 2 or 3 servings in that one bowl. all-in-all unless you are diabetic this mini-wheat is terrific! reviewed by detra fitch of huntress reviews ",positive
" if you like almonds and cruchy granola bars these bars are for you. they are higher in fat than i would like them to be. but they are delicious. great for a quick breakfast or snack. there are 2 bars in each packett and i usually eat one for breakfast and then one later for a snack ",positive
" i am the newest member of the lose & informal office oatmeal club. i have introduced this hot cereal to many a members who are all hooked. those who love oatmeal are and hooked and those who had-to-eat-oatmeal-as-a-kid-and-now-hate-it love it. it tastes great has great farro or barley like texture and it smells heavenly and gets the appetite going ",positive
" i discovered these a few months ago and now i eat them for breakfast everyday. the nutrition info is good and so is the taste ",positive
" i use this mix on a regular basis. both my daughter and i are gluten intolerant so we are always on the lookout for great tasting gf products. this mix makes a great sugar cookiein fact when i brought some for a party at my daughter's school kids preferred my cookies to the other sugar cookies brought. this also makes an excellent chocolate chip cookie ",positive
" this makes a great cake or cupcakes. i used a modification to make it a chocolate cake & it was a hit and also baked them in little bear molds -- the kids loved them. i have 3 little grandgirls and a daughter who are celiac and these mixes are the best thing to have in the house. no one non-celiac can tell the difference ",positive
" this broth tastes just like roast beef; rich delicious and full of flavor. some may think it's a little salty so taste your food before seasoning with extra salt. i'm definitely going to buy more because it is so easy to turn into broth and takes up much less cupboard space than the boxes of stocks. excellent product ",positive
" i bought these nuts for my wife as she likes hazelnuts. she seems to love this brand and she snacks on these nuts very often. my only complaint about these nuts is the price but then everything that is good costs money ",positive
" we love this product. we use it in granola and in making the best chocolate hazelnut bark ever. ",positive
" last weekend as a volunteer at vegfest i had the absolute pleasure of getting to sample all three sauces. for four hours i worked alongside the creator of these heavenly cooking sauces. the wonderful thing about them is that they are not only delicious but are also so simply to use. recipes are on the sides of the jars and they allow you the freedom to choose your favorite foods. i can't recommend them highly enough. ",positive
" great substitute for high fat potato chips. good amount of soy protein (6g per serving) excellent flavor good crunch and texture. these are actually pretty healthy and a great substitute for someone looking for a low fat diet. no trans or saturated fats. my wife and young daughter who do not need a low-fat diet as i do love these. woohoo ",positive
" i love black pepper and have only recently discovered sea salt as a very tasty addition to foods and i like soy products - and i am sorry to say a potato chip junkie. so when i saw the description of these potato soy crisps i had to order them to try them. boy am i glad i did! they are very good right out of the bag; but they are almost in the shape of little bowls so dips and spreads even cream soups can be scooped up in them. they go with everything! nice fresh taste too. this one will be a staple in my pantry ",positive
" i brought a few bags to a work day in may and people are still asking me about them because you can't buy them in stores around here. they're a cross between the soy version of rice cakes and potato chips but people eat them by the handful like potato chips. but instead of making you sluggish like a bag of chips the soy protein gives you energy ",positive
" about a month ago i noticed a new product at my local qfc. it was on sale and i actually did a double take and returned to check out the display. it was filled with bags of fancy nut mixes by sahale snacks. i had been trying to wean myself off sweets by substituting nuts and other trail mixes for candy whenever i got the munchies. sahale snack mixes looked like the fancy upscale town mouse to my regular boring country mouse trail mixes. the one that caught my eye was sing buri with cashew pineapple peanut lemongrass and chinese chili. the ingredients definitely made my mouth water but the picture on the front is what sold me: a heaping bowl of delicious sweet and savory looking cashews and dried pineapple. the bag was pretty expensive at $5.99 on sale for 5 ounces but i was definitely hooked at that point and decided to give it a try. i didn't even wait to get home but opened up the bag in the car and started snacking right away. it was amazing! the more i looked into sahale snacks the more i liked. on the website the story is told of the two founders hiking up mt. rainier in washington state dreaming of something beyond the regular peanut/raisin/m&m combo that was their trail mix. what resulted was a snack mix that was indulgent and healthy. these snack blends are a little pricy but in my opinion totally worth it. this would be a wonderful nut mix to offer to friends and guests when entertaining. this is a high brow snack that you or your guests will love. ",positive
" i love this pasta! it only takes three minutes to cook and has a great flavor. i would prefer a 100% whole wheat pasta but this tastes so good i will continue to purchase this ",positive
" the southwestern spanish flavor is pleasant but not overpowering and the rice is fluffy not clumpy like other brands. i always keep a pouch in my car and at the office for when i don't have time to get out for lunch and in my suitcase for when i need a late night snack while travelling. we always take viva la rice when camping backpacking or boating. this is an excellent product at a very fair price ",positive
" my kids really like to eat this as an after-school or late-night snack. however they like it best when it has been heated for 90 seconds instead of the 60 seconds recommended on the package. my oldest takes it to high school as part of his lunch because it is so quick and he has only 30 min for lunch ",positive
" the best tasting lollipops the fact they are organic is a huge plus. our main focus in our house is to be free of chemical dyes and these fit the bill. they have been a hit with my kids and all the other children we have shared them with. ",positive
" if you care about the sugar that your kids are getting and you want a great tasting lolly... these are great!!! wow ",positive
" thse are the best lollipops i have ever tried- organic or not. the flavors are delicious honestly. i would highly reccommend them to anyone! ",positive
" i bought these lollipops for my allergic kids because these are the only lollipops i have found that don't contain corn. not only do my kids love them but so do my coworkers! they are delicious - much more flavorful than your usual boring lollipops. watermelon is the office favorite so far.. ",positive
" i wasn't sure about this as i normally buy green tea. it is a very pleasant tea. it smells great and is light. ",positive
" i was hesitant to buy this tea since all of the lipton brand teas i have tried have a musty taste and odor to me. but the idea of a mango and peach flavored tea (my two favorite fruits) was irrisitable to me. i am so glad i gave it a try. the scent was incredible and the taste just as good. with a little honey it was one of the best cups of tea i have ever had ",positive
" its a shame they quit carrying it. i would have reordered twice by now ",positive
" nutritious soft & delicious organic zero trans fats whole grain & hemp for fiber omega 3's and some protein ---we just love em!! ",positive
" these bars are terrific.....very moist unlike many other snack bars. they are quite tastey and my kids really like them too ",positive
" my son loves the yankees so i thought these were great when i saw them on teh website. my son loves finding them as a surprise in his lunchbox ",positive
" this product is great for those meals when you have no time or patience for a larger meal plan and it is so handy for any camping or trips where vegetarian food may be scarce. it can be added to any rice or noodle dish or eaten plain with vegetables. the taste is pleasing. ",positive
" these airforce drinks have reasonable flavors and clear attributions as to their ingredients. additionally they seem to provide a little nutritional support beyond the comfort provided by functioning as a polite treat. i like this mandarin-mint flavor the most but all are pretty good. the small red bull style cans look chic in the refrigerator and are a lovely rather special no-trouble hospitality offering for guests and visitors ",positive
" i was a little surprised. i'm not a huge fan of packaged rice or noodle dishes but sometimes i need to throw together something quickly. i was intrigued by the list of ingredients and decided to give fox river rice creole a try. i'm glad i did! this is seriously good stuff -- lots of flavor easy to prepare etc. best of all it's not overly salty one of my pet peeves with packaged food. it's great as a side dish but i think it would also be wonderful with a little dded sausage (maybe some andouille). i'll definitely be purchasing this again ",positive
" my children love smart puffs. i love the smaller packages for school lunches. ",positive
" this is a tasty on the go snack if you are lucky enough to get good fresh batch. the last bunch i got wasnt as enjoyable as i was used to. i realised it was because it lacked crunch. would buy it again though. great guilt free snack. great for kids too ",positive
" these are sweet and crunchy and i love them. my only concern is the price. at a dollar a piece it's a little more than my buget allows for a snack. luckily one packet is usually big enough for me to split for my kids ",positive
" full bodied and flavorful. make the medium cup for a smooth and mellow cup of java. if you make the tall it will be alittle weak ",positive
" of the gloria jean coffees mudslide is my favorite. good taste when used with the keurig b70 and the 9.25 oz size brew. i am on my 2nd order over 50 k cups made and have never had a misfire. the previous reviewer simply had a bad batch ",positive
" this jerky is awesome! great shape extremely good taste (kind of sweet for jerky but very tasty) and very healthy (no nitrites no msg no hormones etc.). try it ",positive
" anyone who thinks cereal is boring for breakfast hasn't tried this one. it's so tasty yet also healthy. it's my favorite but lately has been impossible to find. kellogg's is missing the boat by not giving this cereal a top-notch advertising campaign because once people try this cereal they're hooked! now if we could only get it back on the grocery shelves or the online grocery again (are you listening amazon??). in the words of another old commercial try it you'll like it! ",positive
" i was never big on cereals until i tried this one. now i'm hooked. this is a very flavorable cereal with a nice mix of strawberries and blueberries. it's great for anytime you have the munchies but don't want to eat empty calories. it's also the best of all the cereals that add fruit ",positive
" we 1st found this coffee at a local store. the local store decided not to carry it anymore and we were without it until we found that amazon sold it. it has a good aroma and taste plus it is organic as well. ",positive
" this is the first gluten-free product i found that my daughter likes. perhaps likes isn't the right word -- she eats large helpings every time i serve it. for a little variety i put some broccoli cuts or carrots right into the mix. this is the favorite in our household ",positive
" another viva la rice ready to eat product that is delicious with just the right amount of flavor and great texture! i don't know how they do it but it is just right in size to take to work camping or to have at home ",positive
" this cereal is not quite as hearty as some muesli i am used to but is excellent. many characteristics on the plus side: is truly multigrain (contains wheat oat corn rice barley and millet) is sweetened only just enough to appeal to the palate - which is to say it is not horribly sweet like the common american breakfast cereal is light and crispy with some of the ingredients powdery so they tend to combine with milk and make it thicker and does in fact have a nice light blueberry flavor. the only aspect i'm not thrilled about is that the raisins and almonds are scarce compared to the excellent less expensive muesli-type cereal i buy at the local aldi. this nature's path cereal has a corn-flake-like chip predominant as shown on the box ",positive
" these brownies have a wonderful chocolate flavor and i can eat them without worrying about hydrogenated oils preservatives unnatural colors or flavors because there aren't any! so far i have made two batches. neither batch came out perfectly chewy. the first batch came out a little hard but the 2nd batch was better than the 1st and i think i'm getting the hang of it. this is better than anything else i've tried. i had given up on the other commercial mixes due to additives so this is a great treat. ",positive
" these brownies are pure and natural. being all organic there is no chemical flavor that is usually present in boxed brownie mixes. this mix makes a delicious batch of chewy chocolate heaven you can taste the richness of the real organic ingredients. i urge you to try a box a chocolate lovers dream ",positive
" if you are looking for gluten free cereal that is not sweet...this is the one. it tastes like corn flakes and holds milk well ",positive
" the number of palatable gluten free cereal flakes is quite limited and they are usually quite expensive. this cereal costs $7.00/bag at my local health food store. one needs a place to store a case of 26 oz bags but it's worth it to buy from amazon.com by the case ",positive
" when it comes to prepared cereals this has to be one of the best manufactured in north america in terms of value for money. that it is also delicious and that it doesn't go soggy as soon as you pour on the milk are two more good reasons to try and buy mesa sunrise. and if you are concerned about all that other stuff mentioned described with words like organic kosher gluten-free and so on then by all means enjoy the extra feelings of vindication ",positive
" i hate oatmeal. i am not an oatmeal person. i've tried lots of different brands and flavors because i like the health benefits of eating oatmeal. i bought this because of the flax seeds and wanting to incorporate more omega-3 fatty acids in my diet but what i got was a pleasant surprize. this is a good tasting oatmeal. i heat it up and add soymilk at the end to the consistancy that i like ",positive
" this instant oatmeal is the only one i have had that tastes like real oatmeal. it does not have that artificial taste that most instant oatmeals have ",positive
" this bruschetta topping is made from perfectly ripe tomatoes and capers and has a full baslamic base note. the chuncky texture is perfect for those who would prefer home-made but the quality is as good or superior to the sauces i've made at home. i like the other flavors of pasta sauce too but the bruschetta topping is my favorite for its chunky texture ripe fruit and deft balance of seasonings ",positive
" unbelievably rich and chocolaty without sugar! no artificial sweetener aftertaste. i like that it's low fat and high in calcium. plus the canister (instead of individual packets) lets you vary the portion to match the size of your mug or your strength preference. yummy on a cool day ",positive
" this is my first freeze-dried fruits experience. fruits are very sweet except the kiwi was a little tart. i have tried other fruits from the same merchant pleased. and just received the apples. i will slowly try the rest of flavors. need to say more ",positive
" i like flavored coffees but not my husband. that's part of why we got keurig maker. have started trying the different flavors and this is the dessert-y kind of flavor i'm looking for (and my other top favorite so far is green mountain's caramel vanilla cream). been making it on the 8oz mug setting and just fine ",positive
" this is a wonderful tea: aromatic smooth and robust. i haven't come across a better earl grey yet. ",positive
" this is in my opinion by far the best earl grey tea in the market. loose tea is significantly better in taste than the tea bags from the same manufacturer. the 6 pack is a great deal ",positive
" the opportunity to get twinings earl grey in large containers at a very reasonable price was too good to pass up. ",positive
" outstanding full-flavored earl grey tea. better than the other non-branded earl grey teas ",positive
" earl grey is my favorite blend of tea by far - no competition there. the biggest secret with this tea once given to earl grey of hoswick hall (british prime minister in 1830 - 1834) by a chinese manadarin reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil a rather intense tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to south vietnam and its oil was probably the recipe's original ingredient). using too much bergamot oil can easily obscure the black tea's natural flavor - but with twinings you just can't go wrong because the original earl grey turned to this very company for a match to the quickly dwindling supply he had received from his chinese friend. (from the twinings website: when the mandarin's tasty gift began to run out earl grey asked his tea merchants twinings to match it for him. twinings unique blend was the grey family's long-standing favourite. when guests inquired about it they were directed to twinings on the strand where they would ask for earl grey's tea by name.) unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk i recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend's particular flavor. (but that's just me of course.) whichever way you have it though if scented teas are your kind of thing twinings earl grey should be right up your alley ",positive
" these are great the whole family loves them and they have 5 mg fiber per package. really tasty nice and crunchy. i have several boxes of them in the car for when the little ones need a little something when we are on the go. other snack ideas include those little raisin boxes (but then raisins get everywhere) and packages of dried fruit (which seem to work pretty well since they are not as sticky as raisins). these all-bran snack bites really go over well and they are much healthier than candy. i sure wish amazon would sell these online ",positive
" these are a delicious and nutritious snack! my husband who would otherwise never eat such a thing wolfs these down because they are so scrumptious. the all-bran bars are great too. keep up the good work kellogg ",positive
" quickly became my favorite when it first came out. tastes great and the milk doesn't turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals. i also use it on ice cream to add crunch. i would give it 5 stars but even though it think it's great it is overpriced. price here is about the same as out local safeway ",positive
" this is a very high quality snack which combines a hearty solid granola with irresistable double chocolate. i really love this product -- a chocolate lover's dream. yet it's surprisingly healthy and not too sweet. the fat/sugar content is comparable to most other granolas. i've tried numerous granola's over the years and this one is special. probably not the most nutritious granola overall but it's definitely a treat for the tastebuds and a welcome relief from ordinary granolas. i would not have this as my exclusive source of granola but i will buy this many more times in the future to satisfy my chocoholic cravings. in fact i will probably always keep this product handy because it's highly satisfying. great for a breakfast snack or dessert. yummy ",positive
" my family always enjoys mini wheats and this shipment was no exception. everything was just as tasty as store-bought. i have recommended amazon to family and friends. when i had a question amazon was right there to solve the problem. ",positive
" i purchased this product in the last week from a local store and was so suprised at 1.) how good it tastes and 2.) how much the texture is like real oat granola. i had seen the gf granola before but did not get it because i thought the flakes would make it more like flake cereal. i was definitely mistaken. not only does it satisfy my texture cravings it has some great ingredients like flax seeds and dried fruit. it actually had a good ratio of fruit to nuts and other contents rather than having one or 2 pieces of fruit in the whole bag like some other manufacturers like to do. in all i totally loved this product and now that i see buying in bulk from amazon will save me $2/bag i will be sure to buy it here next time ",positive
" finally a gf/cf granola! this stuff is amazing! i got it for my husband and daughter (2) who are gf/cf but i love this stuff too! and i am truly not a nuts and seed person but i can't stop eating it! i'm so happy to be able to give my daughter a snack that has such great protein in it and is so easy to eat! my husband is just going to keep a bag in his car to snack on ",positive
" my [...] was addicted to all kinds of cheese crackers. when she had to go gluten-free we searched for some adequate substitute. while they are not cheddar goldfish crackers they are very tasty and satisfying. ",positive
" tastes great and the price was good ",positive
" my wife loves strong coffee. this is the only k-cup that did the trick for her. makes a good bold cup of coffee ",positive
" excellent replacement for the campbells condensed soup. i am able to cook gluten free for a crowd and no one can tell the difference with this simple substitution. it is the best ",positive
" this is an excellent source for omegas and efas and also great tasting. all the benefits with out the drive to the healthfood store and their high markup on the price. fantastic product from outside the us because of uneconomic gullible politician false impressions ",positive
" nutty taste this good for you oil makes great iol based salad dressings ",positive
" i was surprised to find out that amazon sold groceries and at a much better price then could be found in a supermarket. a+ to amazon ",positive
" what i like most about these muffin packs is that the whole mix only makes 6 muffins total. many other mixes make 12 or more and if you have a small household you're stuck with way too many muffins. these were better than expected - they are soft flavorful and baked perfectly. also use a small amount of cooking spray on your muffin pans and these will pop right out of the pan after cooking. it isn't the healthiest food out there but overall i'd recommend this mix ",positive
" this is simply wonderful licorice with an intense layered flavor. my dad's a long-time licorice fan and this stuff gives him a big smile -- so he's getting a four-pack for christmas! great texture great flavor great price ",positive
" increases nutritional value of soups and smoothies and tastes almost like nuts ",positive
" i first tried this product when i was studying in philadelphia. i ordered it for an organic group i lead on campus and the reviews were outstanding. i simply love the product and taste of the hemp seeds. no trace drugs just natural nutritionally-beneficial components ",positive
" would highly recommend this product -- i've bought it for friends even to show them that granola could be this wonderful. i've tried the flax plus also but it wasn't as good as the hemp plus. i would also recommend the bar form of this product which doesn't seem to be on amazon currently and is a bit pricy in stores ",positive
" hardley any bad ones in the whole bag. i bought these through figis and theirs were terrible compared to these and had a lot of bad ones in them plus they cost more ",positive
" the nuts used tasted very fresh. the bite sized chunks were just right. it is lightly sweetened but not too sweet. very satisfying = ) ",positive
" these nuts are excellent just a light glaze to sweeten tham a bit ",positive
" i've enjoyed this product for several years and it was very convenient for me to be able to get it in the mail from amazon. thank you ",positive
" the granola bar has a high sugar content but not excessively sweet. however the bar tastes good and the trace of honey is appealing. it has a crunchy texture. the manufacturers have added peanuts too the mixture providing a rich taste. the prohibitive price makes these bars less attractive. 12 bars go quick. i recommending waiting until a coupon opportunity surfaces and then buying the bars in bulk. the bars have good self life and make a nice addition to your food storage. the bars are great for snacks for trips and a energy pickup mid-morning and later in the day ",positive
" these bars have an amazing mildy sweet and nutty flavor! the bars are very crunchy and hearty in texture and are therefore super satisfying as a snack at any time of the day! they've been around forever and i haven't found anything new that beats them yet! the oats n honey is our family's favorite flavor! we've tried others and always gone back to the true classic! i usually purchase ours at the local grocery store but i am in the middle of trying to figure out if amazon offers a better deal. try it you'll like it ",positive
" this is a very tasty creamy hot cereal. if you're gluten-sensitive give this a try -- after i switched to a gluten-free diet i was missing oatmeal something awful. i thought i would give this a try as an alternative and was glad i did! with some brown sugar and raisins and a little imagination you can be satisfied with this cereal ",positive
" these were absolutely delicious. i bought them as a treat for my co-workers they disappeared very quickly. we couldn't stop eating them and will be ordering them again. they are not shiny covered almonds like we were expecting rather they are hand dipped in a lot of very good chocolate and have drizzles over the top and a flat bottom edge. very fresh taste ",positive
" i love swiss miss cocoa especially the little marshmallows they put in the pack. the milk chocolate is great the rich chocolate has a little deeper chocolate/semi-sweet to darker flavor and the marshmallows are just cool. great for the wintertime. stock up and enjoy. also great to use part of a pack in a cup of coffee get the sweetness of cocoa and the kick of coffee got me through a few late nights ",positive
" they taste like graham crackers and are great portion control! i ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it. if you are counting calories this is the way to go ",positive
" i bought a case of these at the same time as i purchased the cheddar fries. these are smaller packages so you get more in a case. these are white cheddar steak fries where the cheddar fries are thinner and longer. these white cheddar steak fries are white and very cheesey and salty snack they have unique flavor and don't taste anything like the cheddar fries at all. i gave it a 4 star cause i prefer the cheddar ones better ",positive
" i love andy capp steak fries but be warned about long shipping times. it has been two weeks since my order and i haven't received the product. i don't know if fedex style shipping would have helped ",positive
" these are slightly thicker than regular gluten cornflakes but still tasty. don't expect them to be sweet...like frosted flakes. they are just plain. very good though...and great in recipes ",positive
" as anyone who has tried bahlsen hit cookies knows they are absolutely yummy despite the odd packaging and name. a nice crunchy cookie not sickeningly sweet good with cream and sugar tea. funny thing about the minis though both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction so that one of the sides is the wrong way with the printed side towards the cream....just a sidebar--no detraction from how tasty these cookies are.

" we love popcorn as an occasional treat at night but don't like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn. we had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something. this is just right - low in fat no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose and organic to boot. i also feel good about buying newman's products because of the causes they support and all the money doesn't go to corporate profits ",positive
" this coffee is amazing.. we stayed at the shore club in miami beach and we had some of this coffee with our breakfast at ago restaurant. hooked ever since this is the only coffee i ever drink now. starbucks caribou are nothing compared to this. one sip or sniff of the aroma will get you hooked forever. if you ever make it out to south beach illy has a store on ocean drive ",positive
" i like these a lot. they are only slightly salty with a bit of molasses sweetness all balanced against a mild licorice flavor. they are medium-hard and very chewy although they must be kept in an airtight container or they get too hard. personally i would prefer a stronger licorice flavor but these are still among my favorites. salty licorice is indeed a strange thing for those who haven't tried it before. if you've never had it before don't start with a case (like what's sold here). and definitely stay away from double salt licorice until you've learned whether you like the saltiness. if you want black licorice but don't want the salty flavor try haribo licorice wheels. those have more licorice flavor than these coins and less other flavor. they're a bit sweet and a bit softer. note that these coins also come in bags. buying them that way is slightly more cost-effective but the tubs might be a little more airtight ",positive
" first things first you will not be treated to that classic 'cooking' smell. in fact your appetite is better off not catching a whiff of that magnesium-salt concoction that heats your meal. think happy thoughts and be oblivious. why? because the meal itself is actually pretty good (and has an airtight separation with the 'oven'). the package also includes plastic spork knife and napkin. basically the ingredients are on-par with what you would typically find in canned stew (and similarly need not be refrigerated). however the meal loses one star because the serving size is fairly small. 210 calories isn't a whole lot to go on particularly if you must engage in strenuous physical activity under low-temperature conditions. pros: lightweight keeps well cooks itself easy disposal tastes good. cons: cost and storage space per calorie is somewhat high. if you were creative you might be able to figure a way to cook something else using the box oven ",positive
" i received one of these meals after hurricane rita. they were being handed out by first responders to people in the area before our utilities were restored. excellent product. i wanted more so i could stock up in case of another disaster or emergency. i found their website and discovered that they were not for sale over the internet. i was very disappointed...until today. i went back to their website and saw that the meals are now available from amazon! this is great news! i suggest that everyone stock up on these meals in case of emergencies. they really come in handy.

" twinings blend of ceylon and indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor. in non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness brightness strength and flavor. normally i wouldn't attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses trucks and stores for long periods of time. yet twinings seems to hold up well. i love tea would drink 24/7 if possible and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and twinings is definetly one of them ",positive

" twinings was founded in london england in 1706 and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. irish breakfast tea is a mixture of ceylon and assam (black) teas well-known for its strong malty taste. ok let's get down to brass tacks - irish breakfast tea is not for everyone. there's an old irish saying that says that a proper cup of tea should be strong enough for a mouse to trot on and this tea is certainly within striking distance of that target! but if you add milk and sugar to this fine tea you will be rewarded with a smooth and full-flavored drink. irish breakfast tea is in a class by itself among the teas i have drunk in that it comes closest to being like coffee - that is having a strong taste that gets you up and going in the morning. not all teas will stand up to a proper breakfast but this one will. overall i have found this to be a wonderfully interesting tea strong and robust. and that's my review. if you want a tea that will round out your hearty breakfast then irish breakfast tea is for you. if you want tea from a great tea producer them twinings is for you. i highly recommend this hearty tea ",positive

" i like a cup of coffee with character and thus far this black gold extra bold has delivered. the extra bold defines that this k-cup carries an extra 20-30% of coffee per serving than the standard k-cup and as a result this delivers the extra kick that i tend to like. we only brew at the 7.25oz and sometimes the 5.25oz volume on our b-70 brewer as we prefer a stronger cup of joe. this roast is on the dark side and delivers flavor with intensity and a nice smoky essence as described. i also find that this provides a hint of crema much like a shot of espresso when brewed fresh. we like it and if you like stronger coffee we think you will too! try it ",positive

" these are the best almonds i've ever had. though it is true that the amazon ad states they are all natural (an error on their part not on emerald) they are very close to it. the pricing here is a bit high. at our higher end market i pay $5.49 for an 11oz canister. the pricing is better to buy at the store than through amazon overall. but if it is convenience that sways your buying preference this comes fairly close (about $7-8 higher). i do highly recommend this brand ",positive
" i ordered this soup along with a bunch of others on my goldbox special a few weeks ago. the soup comes in individually packaged microwavable cups that are easy to take to work or school with you. upon microwaving the soup flavor was very good but the dehydrated items inside (particularly the noodles and the beans) were hard and crunchy. after letting the dehydrated items soak for a few minutes i tried it and it was perfect. very good flavor but it has a very strong garlic component to the flavor maybe a little too strong. i would recommend further diluting the soup down which would entail emptying the contents into a larger bowl for heating defeating the point of the microwavable cups. i would purchase this soup again if it was offered at the goldbox price of nine bucks for the 12 pack. but at the price currently offered i'm not certain i would go for it again. nevertheless the flavor is good and if you like strong flavor with the convenience of the individually packaged cups it might be worth a shot ordering it one time to see if you love it ",positive

" twinings was founded in london england in 1706 and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. english breakfast tea is a mixture of black teas from sri lanka which are blended to produce a smooth yet flavorful tea. though often served during breakfast this tea tastes excellent all day long. ok let's get down to brass tacks - this is another great tea. harder to over-steep than some of the teas i have known it consistently produces a smooth and highly drinkable cup. highly conventional in its taste english breakfast tea has a robust flavor that stands up well to lemon and milk which makes it a favorite among those who like to accessorize their tea. plus i must say that this tea is wonderful iced - add some lemon and sugar and you've got the right tea for a hot afternoon! and that's my review. if you want an excellent all-round tea hot or iced one that goes well with any food then english breakfast tea is for you. if you want tea from a great tea producer them twinings is for you. i highly recommend twinings' english breakfast tea to all even those not normally into tea drinking. (or perhaps especially to those not normally into tea drinking! ",positive
" seriously folks shop around all you like but you cannot beat this lavazza espresso for a full bodied not-at-all-bitter taste whether you are making espresso or cappuccino. i've used it for at least 15 years in three different machines - francis francis! and my office machine rancilio silvia and have never found a substitute. my office is right next to dean and deluca in nyc and i've tried super expensive espresso blends at over $20.00/pound nothing comes close. amazon was recently out of stock (as they are often) and i accidentally brought the lavazza oro whole beans thinking they were already ground. yuk! i had them ground in my local coffee dealer but they have no taste compared to this. i gave them away and got hold of my favorite black can. amazon's price can't be beat believe me i've tried i get 8 cans at a time and enjoy perfect coffee all day long just like in rome! ciao ",positive
" what can i say about lavazza that hasn't already been said. i was in rome two summer's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets. decaf is usually not so great but this is. they must be doing something right ",positive
" excellent! i am thrilled about finally finding coffee that smells and tastes just like what you can get at good hotels and brasseries in europe. i was previously buying lavazza's supercrema in whole bean format because i had tried it at one of my favorite italian restaurants in beverly hills and thought it was great. however it would not turn out the same using my semi-automatic home espresso machine and my low-end grinder. therefore for those who do not own $12000 fully automatic commercial espresso machines like that restuarant did this coffee is a much better choice. the caffee espresso comes in perfectly ground cans ready for the home espresso machine. the italians at lavazza definitely know what they're doing! definitely buy this coffee and enjoy ",positive
" i love my tassimo! for years i have been searching for an economical and convenient way to replicate starbucks lattes and mochas at home and this is the system that finally achived it. i don't use the latte/ capuccino milk pods unless i'm in dire straights - it's better to steam real milk (search for milk steamer on amazon - that's a great product too!) - but the espresso is great and i haven't been to starbucks in weeks. hands down recommended no holds barred ",positive

" i know what excellent coffee is - i typically buy blue mountain coffee from jablum at $40/lb and make espresso with that (4 shots at a time) because it's so smooth. i bought 5# of this coffee (mainly because of the claimed hypercaffinated nature) and made my usual espresso pot with it. by the time i was through 1/4 of the cup (basically 1 shot) i was completely in orbit from the caffeine and i was quite impressed with the fact that the coffee was smooooooooth - on a par with the blue mountain that i usually buy (but at a fraction of the cost...). i didn't get the shakes like with other coffee - just a state of extreme alertness for the next 9 or 10 hours.. and while i was workin' on that first cup i sent in a testimonial to the shock coffee website (yep it's on there). the beans are a blend of light medium and dark roast - they're selected for caffeine content and it's everything they claim. i took about 1# of the stuff ground it up and brought it in the office. we actually got quite a bit of work done that day :-) unfortunately for me i now have a bunch of shock addicts running around asking me for some of my personal stash - so i have to buy some just for the office staff... if you like coffee - get this stuff. it's smooth. not rip your lungs out harsh like that starbucks stuff that you have to add 500# of sugar and caramel to just so you can drink it. buy it... it works... *bing* *bing* *bing* richochet rabbit! :- ",positive

" a trained eye would see that shock coffee is a blend of arabica & robusta coffee beans! just like many other ingredients there is good and bad robusta & arabica beans. wines are made from different grapes and it's the individuals' pallet that distinguishes between good and bad. in europe the coffee bean of choice is robusta as they appreciate a stronger and bolder coffee. with that said i'd recommend shock for anybody who wants that extra kick with a better than average taste. i'd also like to reiterate that robusta beans are given a bad rap but the truth stands that some robusta beans have a great robust taste - no pun attended! ",positive
" i love this coffee. it has a strong flavor and aroma and gets you moving in the morning. i do not believe it is meant to be a fancy gourmet coffee but rather what i would call trucker or cowboy coffee. if you like strong coffee buy it. if you like delicate coffee buy something else ",positive
" this snack blend is the best! i tried it on the recommendation of a friend and have come to love it. it's perfect alone but i enjoy putting the mix on salads. it definitely spices them up a bit and the flavor is amazing. i have become a big fan of this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to add a little excitement to their everyday snacks ",positive
" i love these chips...they have a taste that gets better the more you chew them and they give you plenty of fiber and soy protein. i wish they weren't as high in fat as they are but they're good for a once in awhile indulgence ",positive
" this is very good coffee and is one of my favorites. the moca gives it a little different flavor but it goes well with the dark roast beans. i have purchased this item several times and would recommend this product to others ",positive
" sorry i could not have rated 10 stars. i feel they taste better than if i picked them myself! i want to purchase more. thank you amazon always ofering the best ",positive
" bigger and more luscious than any other available dried blueberries. they make a huge difference and are worth the extra price. i substitute them for the raisins in our favorite quaker oatmeal cookie recipe and everyone loves the results. hope the oatmeal and blueberry health benefits cancel the butter/sugar calories! ",positive
" why are people demonizing high fructose corn syrup ? the only reason it's cheaper in the us is....america has ..lots....of...corn. eat more corn. use more corn syrup. unripe berries have less fructose mass harvesting them probably places unripe berries into the mix and its compensated for ",positive
" i enjoy eating the product however the blueberries are very sweet. the sweetness helps satisfy my sweet tooth and i do no have the desire for candy. the nutritious value i am receiving from eating blueberries is beneficial for my wellbeing. i keep them at bedside for a satisfying snack ",positive
" i've been a big fan of ener-g foods alternative food products. ever since i discovered that i was wheat and gluten allergic these have been my only substitutes for breads. these muffins are very tasty and crispy when toasted and are instant favorites of mine. also check out ener-g's light brown rice bread for sandwiches and their cookie assortment. these are so good that i don't even miss regular wheat breads and cookies ",positive
" i've purchased many of these products. i put this in my top three. good refreshing lemonade with a nice raspberry flavor to give it that extra kick. ",positive
" lapsang souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded wuyi mountains in the northwestern corner of china's fujian province (north of guangdong [canton] province) whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the taiwan straits. this tea has an unmistakeably smokey note which for years made it a particular favorite with the single malt and cigars crowd of english clubs and drawing rooms. that aroma is created during the tea's smoking process which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. the finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the quing dynasty (1644 - 1911) when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time creating an instant sensation there. because of its potent aroma lapsang souchong should not steep very long. the rule of thumb is that the paler its color the more likely you'll truly enjoy it ",positive
" i have tried all four fox river rice flavors and this is my favorite. while cooking the rice the aroma of the seasoning filled my kitchen! this flavor also has a little bite from the pepper. i have served it with chicken and steak! great product ",positive
" i have never ordered anything such as this online. i was surprised that the nuts arrived in about half as much time as the site said it would take. i will consider ordering again once i have used these up. the walnuts were so fresh and nice not all broken up as some have been when i have purchased them at the grocery store. ",positive
" get your children to eat a little bit of fiber!! these are really good. of course their almond and mixed nuts flavors are even better! ",positive
" hain popped corn cakes are simply delicious just enough crunch and sweetness to satisfy my hungry teenagers. very healthy too.. ",positive
" i absolutely love the taste of this tea and so does everyone else i've encouraged to try some (even my coffee drinking daughter). i drink a lot of herbal teas and this is definitely my favorite. i can't tell if it's really detoxifying my liver and kidneys but i do know that drinking a cup boosts my energy level and make me feel better. also don't let the name of the tea make you think you can only drink it occasionally the box states that it's mild enough to be used every day for up to 30 days. my only disappointment at the moment is that the six-pack on amazon isn't currently available ",positive
" i too totally disagree with the other reviewer who didn't like this. this is a mild-tasting smooth tea that you could drink anytime. it is one of my favorite teas ",positive
" maybe i'm crazy but i totally disagree with the other review. i think this tea is delicious. i don't know if it really detoxifies your body but it tastes good ",positive
" if you like a tasty oil sesame oil is one to try. and this is a good flavorful sesame oil. perfect for asian cooking and for 'tweaking' traditional foods that can use a touch more flavor ",positive
" my two year old loves these and prefers them over goldfish. i did a taste test with goldfish and the cheddar bunnies seem cheesier. they seem less dry too. ",positive
" this mix is a blessing for those w/ food allergies! even if we didn't have any food allergies i'd buy this mix. i do have to cook it a bit longer than the box states and a lot longer(10m) if using a glass dish ",positive
" i have tried all of cherrybrook kitchen products and they are fabulous! even without eggs dairy and peanuts these products taste even better than if i made it from scratch. their brownie is deliciously chocolately and if cooked for about 16 minutes comes out fudgy also! i also like the chocolate chips right in the mix! i would highly recommend it ",positive
" the first thing you notice about this cereal is the aroma. it's reminiscent of fish oil supplements. having never eaten flax of any kind before i don't know if the aroma is typical of flax. at first serving i was sure i'd consume the rest of the box (eventually) but would not buy more. yet with each serving the aroma is less and less noticeable. i enjoy this cereal and will buy it again. it has more fiber than any other cereal (organic or not) i've seen ",positive
" this product has no fat. this is a good thing. i like to mix it with my coffee for instant mocha ",positive
" flavor is very good. the reason i couldn't rate it higher is that i have trouble getting it to thoroughly mix in. ",positive
" my husband who has celiac disease thinks this is the best bread on the market. it definitely is the easier to make. only requires oil and water and turns out perfect every time. amazon's price beats those health food stores by a long shot! try it ",positive
" this bread is fabulous!! it actually tastes like bread and is light and airy not heavy like most wheat free products. thank you orgran!! ",positive
" if you must have a cookie might as well make it a healthy one. i bought a case and they went fast ",positive
" i've tried a few types of vegan chocolate chip cookies and was always disappointed with how bland they were--and loaded with fat and calories. these are not only the least amount of calories that i've seen for a vegan cookie of this size but i found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non-vegan ones i've had in the past! they are so so so good. whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate? i have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that i am far from deprived! two thumbs up and highly recommended from this vegan chocoholic ",positive
" this tea is amazing! it tastes fresh smooth and light. it's just perfect. i have about 2-3 cups a day. makes me feel great ",positive
" this makes a lovely gift. everything is well packaged and looks expensive. the teas are of good variety and well packaged to insure freshness. recommend ",positive
" gluten free diets can be so much more varied with this product. it can be coating to chicken or meat or can be added to juices/broths to thicken. it can even be used to make a perfect stuffing for chicken or turkey. it has make my boring diet almost feel normal. no feeling of deprivation any more ",positive
" these are sweet and lightly chewy with a touch of lemon. it's been a long time ago since i could get three organic healthy snack bars for a buck. ",positive
" originally looked to buy the wasa light rye but it was out-of-stock. so bought the sourdough rye and multi grain instead and glad i did because they have broadened my selection of favorite wasa brand crispbreads. and while i normally avoid products with yeast i feel that the toasty crispness of the multi grain has neutralized any negative aspects (that yeast is a negative is my story and i'm stickin' to it!) that may be derived from containing yeast. as for varied uses it's equally great for strengthening the teeth (and should be a great weight loss adjunct because it is not easy to eat fast and requires some mastication which should satisfy the need to have eaten) when eaten as a cracker or mechanically grinding to a pouder for use to coat salmon coquettes. oh some more good news is that moths will try to eat through a package of rye crispbreads which means what's inside is edible for humans too. i keep mine stored in the freezer because it is so valuable. should be a good nutrient source in case of prolonged emergencies as well. still my preference among all the wasa crispbreads is the light rye. only 2 ingredients rye flour and sea salt. just give me the simple life... without the two accompanying airheads that is. ",positive
" i am addicted to wasa crispbread multi-grain and you will be too. very crisp and hearty flavor. a healthy product with no saturated or trans fat. and only 60 calories per portion. the other wasa products are also worth a try - especially sesame ",positive
" i've never reviewed a food item before but this delectable little bar was so heavenly i had to change my mind. at the time it was a mere snack in between classes; afterwards it earned a place in my heart as well as my eternal devotion. toffee and almonds + chocolate... *sigh* what more could one ask for? ",positive
" high in protein low in calories and great flavor. i split them in half and eat the first portion as a mid-morning snack and the second portion as an afternoon snack. they keep me feeling full and prevent me from eating junk food which has been great for my waistline. i can't say enough good things about kashi ",positive
" ok i eat a lot of protein/fiber bars and most taste like cardboard or something worse. this bar is the best - i eat it for breakfast lunch or as dessert after dinner. the texture reminds me of a chewy rice crispy treat - seriously. love it ",positive
" i love kashi stuff and this bar is no exception. there have just a great taste not too sweet no funny aftertaste and very satisfying when eaten between meals. highly recommended. ",positive
" i am one hardly to ever leave product reviews and as much as i buy online i should work on that. but after trying the various kashi products these bars are by far the best and i feel the need to leave a review! i started off eating the kashi honey almond flax granola bars which are very good but definitley not as sweet as these (not a good or bad thing just a comparison). however you will still get the protein fiber and omega-3s if that's what you're looking for. if you love chocolate and almonds and are looking for a protein/fiber bar that tastes good and is more on the sweet side this is definitely one to try!!! whether you use them as a meal replacement or as a snack they are absolutley amazing and i will definitely be a repeat customer ",positive
" i like the basic special k flakes made from rice & wheat (though i really shouldn't eat gluten). mostly i use cereal to snack on vs. with milk (boo lactose!). special k tends to have more nutritional value than most cereals which i like too. but i wasn't enamored with either the fruit or the yogurt parts of this particular cereal. frankly i think it would taste better without them or with something else. the yogurt pieces didn't seem to merge well with the cereal imho. but then that's why there's chocolate & vanilla ",positive
" this is a great tea and very economical when buying bulk from amazon. i'm very happy with it ",positive
" if you like strawberries you'll love crunchies! only 98 calories per pouch - i snacked on one pouch all day and didn't finish it off! very convenient- resealable. i have other varieties on order! ",positive
" erewhon rice twice cereal is a very flavorful crunchy gluten free cereal. i highly recommend it to anyone who is on a gluten free diet. ",positive
" to rice krispies. love the whole grain rice - it's crisy and it crackles and my gluten sensitive son loves it ",positive
" :: davinci multicolor tortellini :: delicious tortellini from italy. great experience like being delivered from a good italian restaurant! this product has great taste texture and appearance. my only disappointment was just upon arrival first opening the case. the boxes seemed so little. i mean compared to the 12 oz packages of pasta i'm adjusted to buying. it says 7oz right on the web page description very clear but somehow that hadn't really registered in my noggin. however things got better. i soon found out that 7 oz of tortellini cooks up pretty big more servings than i'd have anticipated from the little boxes. very happy with the davinci pastas i've tried so far. i'd be complete if only they also made some pasta sauces for amzn to send to my doorstep along with the pasta. anyway i recommend this tortellini. it's great hot...and come spring will also give it a whirl for cold pasta salad. ",positive
" it's hard to find gluten-free energy bars that aren't too sweet and this totally fits the bill. you wouldn't want to eat these as candy -- there's some subtle truth-in-advertising in the choc-bar name (say it out loud) -- but i think i ate at least six of these on my last backpacking trip and i am pleased to report that these are very tasty with plenty of water when i've been getting a serious workout and need the energy. comparing labels the nutrition and caloric content of an entire choc-bar is pretty similar to that of a clif bar. (the label says the serving size is half a bar but that would be like eating half a clif bar -- there's no way i'm stopping after just a few bites when i'm in the middle of a nine-mile hike! ",positive
" as a vegetarian you can use this is many ways as a meat substitute. ",positive
" great coffee and a bargain when buying it by the 5 pound bag. california does some things better than us here in indiana coffee is one of them ",positive
" smooth flavorful coffee. i wouldn't mind a little stronger flavor but it's very good. huge bag ",positive
" you've just located the most healthy tasty and useful vegetarian broth manufactured today! as a long time user i can tell you that amazon offers the best possible price for this item. i use it for everything: a flavoring for plain rice as a broth for stir frying (instead of oil) as a base for complicated stews and soups. if you find it a bit too salty just add more water. it has no mysterious chemical additives. it is perfect for heart patients diabetics vegans and folks who just like a fast soup treat ",positive
" seitenbacher is a fabulous soup mix! one canister makes 40 cups of broth which makes it incredibly inexpensive. it's also delicious. it makes a truly versatile soup base. people love my nabeyakiudon (japanese noodle soup) matzoah ball soup (jewish dumpling soup) golden lentil stew (indian bean stew) all of which have seitenbacher as the base. it works for people with allergies and food sensitivities (no gluten no lactose no msg no soy). it's all natural and vegetarian (no gelatin). and i can't emphasize enough the rich deep flavor. ",positive
" thanks to our purchase of a keurig i am a converted coffee drinker. timothy's german chocolate cake is my absolute favorite. a delectable blend of warm caramel and coconut gives this coffee a deliciously sweet note while retaining a medium-bodied blend. it isn't too sugary - it's just right! in fact my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. it is scrumptious ",positive
" great flavor and aroma. an excellent choice for an evening coffee break ",positive
" i love velveeta and i love the rotini and cheese; i have had it before but it is hard to find in the grocery stores i shop at...i found it not to be as good as i remembered....the broccoli was minimal at best ",positive
" i was eager to try the sugar blend for baking. i noticed a difference in the consistency of the cake batter and it did not rise as high and seemed to be more compact. the usage guide was helpful and included a recipe on the package. the flavor was comparable to regular sugar and those with diabetes are now able to enjoy some of the sweeter things in life. ",positive
" i am crazy about splenda. i mix equal parts splenda and brown sugar for my hot cerael. it saves money and calories. asparteem ( nutrasweet)gives me loose bowels. splenda meets my sweetner needs without calories ",positive
" all the splenda products are good. but i like the ones that are part splenda and part sugar as they are good for baking. good if you have a diabetic in the house or are trying extra hard to lose weight and are a sugarholic ",positive
" this stuff is delicious! i've been buying it for years as a good quality fairly nutritious snack food for myself (i feed the kids veggie booty and hog the sweet stuff) and it seems to be a pretty good choice. it doesn't take a lot to satisfy and it's not really that bad for you (sugar sure but not as much as some other treats). ",positive
" i love these! my son loves these! you would think there wouldn't be a problem but he sucks on them. as they melt his hands get sticky and then the furniture or toys he touches gets sticky also! but they are so yumm! fyi-13 g of sugar. healthier cereal have 5-7 g so i guess it isn't so bad ",positive
" excellent cookies-my boys love them & know they are a treat that is on the healthy side. we will buy these again. ",positive
" i love these cookies too! they're crunchy animal cookies with a lemony coating that doesn't feel waxy in your mouth. the lemon taste is great and they're not too sweet. they're a perfect afternoon snack when you want a sweet treat but don't want to overdo it with calories or sugar. the box is a little skimpy on the number of cookies you get but the taste is worth it ",positive
" these are a perfect size for work and great portion control! i ordered a case for the ladies at work and we split it. if you are counting calories this is the way to go ",positive
" i so love this jerky. it is moist but not too moist and has great flavor. we have tried several of their flavors and they are all awesome. great prices for hormone free stuff and no preservatives. jerky tastes so much better and richer without msg in it ",positive
" it was a little expensive but well worth it. it lasts allday long or several teapot ",positive
" i love these cookies! the only complaint i had is that i ordered a case (12 boxes) and the expiration date was 4 weeks from the day i received the shipment. yikes i still have over half the case left and i've been eating them daily (and giving them away)! i probably will not purchase again from this vendor for this reason alone. however if you're looking for a great organic cookie without trans fats this is a nice healthy option ",positive
" i doubt if most kids would like this bar but health food fanatics will love it. subtle flavor mixed with chocolate. bar is very filling. dry use with water ",positive
" my son (3) and i love these. he likes to hop them around and kiss them before he eats them. he likes all the bunny graham varieties (chocolate honey cinnamon); they taste like the traditional graham crackers ",positive
" okay so i realize this isn't a real veggie... merely a veggie that's been pureed and turned into a pea pod shaped chip. but man they are good. what's more there aren't any bad ingredients in this product and they're baked not fried! better still my kid prefers them to chips. so while i don't totally win the make your kid love veggies award with this snack i feel i'm one step closer. oh and i love them too ",positive
" these are a fun little snack. they taste good and are crunchy so you can pass on the potato chips. they have two grams of fiber and a small amount of vitamins. they are not low in calories so be careful of the amount you eat. my daughter likes them which is a plus. the price was good at amazon but the shipping was steep. ",positive
" our whole family loves this snack. these make a great toddler snack (they're kind of puffy so if you don't actually chew them they'll just melt). my 2-year old has been eating these for a year now and is constantly asking for his peapods? a portable snack far superior nutritionally to the typical cookie cracker goldfish pretzel and other processed junk most kids are eating. these are just dehydrated snap peas corn oil and salt (and there's still less sodium in these than pepperidge farm's low-sodium goldfish!). a great alternative to the usual snack highly processed of white flour sugar salt and/or chemical preservatives. they're better for you and they taste great. we love them ",positive
" i've been over here in japan for the past 3 years and haven't made too many visits to the states. i will be returning next week though. however this stuff is definitely one addictive snack. in japan it's marketed by the same company as saya endou. not a strong flavor just something to munch on. not too salty and not too sweet. kampeki (perfect). a purchase of the snack is a victory against terrorism. ",positive
" i'm excited to find these for sale on amazon and at a very reasonable price! i just tried them for the first time a few days ago and was wishing there was a nearby store that carried them. everyone i've given them to has liked them even those who are not normally healthy eaters. these crisps are reminiscent of puffy corn snacks (like cheetos) but with a different light flavor. the calorie content is similar to other chip-type snacks (150 per serving) but these have the nutrition benefits of peas--protein (5g per serving) calcium (6% dv per serving) and iron (4% dv per serving). i haven't tried the ceasar flavor yet but intend to do so in the near future. : ",positive
" this is a wonderful gf cereal! it is crunchy a touch sweet and the fruit is a wonderful addition. this is the first gf cereal that my son will really eat. he frequently has 2 bowls and he does not eat much! highly recommend ",positive
" i'm not a huge coffee fan -- most of the time i find it bitter. then there's the whole language you have to learn if you want to order it at one of the popular coffee joints. but occasionally i do feel like i need that little surge of energy. this kona blend coffee is the perfect choice. it has a lot of flavor but none of the bitterness i find in a lot of other coffees. this is the one i put in the coffee maker when i plan to spend the day cleaning house or working on my thesis. it makes great iced coffee too ",positive
" that's all that matters to me. i can't always find it in stock at the local store and i want my husband to be able to enjoy it. i'm not a real coffee drinker but this kona blend seems to lack the bitterness that first turned me off coffee years ago in the first place. so i enjoy some of it too occasionally. and whatever blend he's drinking my husband likes millstone brand. i know it always smells wonderful ",positive
" i love this soup. it is healthy vegetarian and low calore. for a light meal i eat it alone. when i want something more substantial i mix in leftovers and a dash of hot sauce. the microwave bowls make a good portion size. it is really convenient to have it delivered in bulk to my door ",positive
" i've tried the andy capp hot fries white cheddar and these regular cheddar. these have a satisfactory flavor and don't over do it. i find them a good snack with tasty underlying corn flavor and a non-greasy crispness that i like about the andy capp products. they are different from cheese doodles. cheese doodles are more about orange coatings and are uneven in texture. i think it must be the corn-potato combo in the andy capp products that makes them feel good to eat ",positive
" andy capp fries have become my favorite crunchy snack. i like both the chedder and hot fries. the texture and flavor from both varieties surpass my love of potatoe chips and cheese doodles. highly recommend andy capp fries in both flavors ",positive
" supposedly this is the safest artificial sweetener and it tastes fine too. favorite uses: coffee tea and hot cereals such as oat bran and unsweetened oatmeal. i ordered two of these gegunda boxes and am grateful for the opportunity to save so much money vs. supermarket prices. unfortunately there was a terrible delay: i ordered on feb 2 and didn't receive until march 20. otherwise no complaints and i'm fixed for sweetener for a good year ",positive
" i think splenda is great but i grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is is to let a sugar addict try it. my husband happens to be one and he cannot tell the difference between splenda and sugar in his tea! as with other artificial sweeteners you get an unpleasant after taste--with the splenda there is none! you can use this to cook with too! it's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar.

" this product has been a lifesaver to me. with wheat allergies and loving pasta i thought i would never get to eat it again! the pasta tastes great and my family doesn't even notice the difference...they like it too! thanks orgran ",positive
" i have sensitive [to sugar] teeth and these are beautiful and healthy. most granola bars you find in stores are full of sugar and have next to no nutritional value- no thanks. these are good for you and taste rather good too. they are a bit bland but i like the texture... with what's in them and how they're held together they're a bit like rice krispy treats but taste....healthy. yum. i love taking these to work for a quick snack instead of vending machine ",positive
" i bought this tea for my mom for her birthday and everyone in the family loves it. this is excellent chai tea ",positive
" this is amazingly good! worlds apart from the usual mac and cheddar products on the market. really worth trying! delivery was fast and everything arrived just fine. i highly recommend this product ",positive
" pemmican premium and long lasting peppered flavor is the best i have ever had by far - and i am a certified jerky freak. they are not stringy or rubbery simply easy to eat and absolutely delicious ",positive
" as an asthmatic with a sulfa allergy i thought i was limited to naturally dried fruits which are tasty but not aesthetically appealing. i'd been looking for some way of getting my fix for dried fruit without running the risk of (at worst) a trip to the emergency room. i'd found a number of other freeze-dried fruits but most of them had sugar added something i try to avoid. i ordered this product (orchard blend) with the hope that it would be flavorful. wow was it! aside from being good as a quick snack for when my blood sugar starts to drop it's also fantastic when mixed with plain oatmeal to give it a little something more. i'm extremely pleased with this product and i would recommend it to anyone that has been avoiding dried fruits because of a sulfa sensitivity or allergy ",positive
" excellent taste and texture. the apples are the crunchiest but even the pulpier fruits have a pleasing texture. if you really like your crunch i'd go for the all-apple product. my only disappointment is that you're not getting a lot for your money. i love the convenient portion-control packaging but $1.10 for a 3/4 ounce 70 calorie serving makes me more worried about my wallet than my weight when considering what to snack on in the afternoon. so i'll order more but these have become an occasional snack and not an everyday one ",positive
" i found timely service and a surpisingly good tasting snack. i have never had this type of dried fruit and was very satified as usually healthy things just don't taste that good. nice surprise ",positive
" i bought some nana's no refined sugar cookies in several flavors when a local health food store was having a moving sale. they were so incredible i looked online and was delighted to find them on amazon and bought some here. these cookies taste fantastic and they are very moist as well. really all of the flavors i tried (choc chip coco chip and oatmeal raisin) were outstanding ",positive
" green is good of course. but what's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies. pn os beat the bootie out of any oreo variation -- crunchier more filling(without being smarmy) much better taste. (and this goes for the mint the vanilla and the chocolate.) fast eddie felson -- i love you. ",positive
" my husband and i like the newman o's better than oreo's and our 3 year old son loves them! as we did as a child he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling just like an oreo. also the newman o's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have ",positive
" my children prefer this cookie much more than the standard chocolate cookie with cream. these are a bit softer than the o's we use to purchase but it also makes them much easier to twist apart and eat! =) we purchased the chocolate with chocolate cream too - yummy ",positive
" nice chewy texture not fossilized like the health food store bulk bin kind and great taste. packaged as they are (2 resealable packages of 20oz. each)it's a very economical buy too. just store one in the 'fridge or freezer until you finish the first. our kids like these better than raisins ",positive
" i have ordered stoneridge orchards dried montmorency cherries twice. the cherries have arrived in good condition and taste wonderful ",positive
" i was very pleased with these dried cherries. they are delicious -- not too sweet not too tart. healthy too ",positive
" i've never been a big fan of dried fruit -- good for you or not they are just too sweet for me. but these montmorency cherries are wonderful. it's the right mix of sweetness with tartness. i love to eat these straight out of the bag. ",positive
" this is yet another fabulous blend of ingredients; not too sweet not too salty. great for kids and us big kids who are on the go and tired of the same old trail mix/protein bars on the run. keep up the good wor ",positive
" i am a prediabetic person. this product helps keep my sugar under control. my numbers are great after i eat this cereal ",positive
" love this oatmeal! no sugar which is a bonus for athletes wanting good complex carbs w/o added sugar. one packet gives you a nice creamy treat. much creamier than other instant oatmeals. highly recommend it ",positive
" this is great instant oatmeal i eat it almost every morning. i used to buy the quaker or store brand of the same flavor in the grocery store but i will continue to buy this. it is very convenient to order this in quantity even though i'm the only one in my household eating it since i go through it pretty quickly ",positive
" since the description says this product contains splenda i don't understand why the guy who posted a bad review would avoid amazon grocery products at all costs just because he apparently didn't read the description before buying. mccann's makes great oatmeal. read the description before buying anything would be my adivce ",positive
" excellent product. amazon's prices were very good a few months ago. however now the price is more than the popcorn costs in the grocery store ",positive
" this delicious breakfast cereal packs a punch and it doesn't overload you with too many calories or fat either. it stays crunchy in milk and the honey/nut taste beckons you to have another bowl. the cereal is comparatively low in sugar certified kosher and it contains no trans fats--hooray! it offers potassium and the recipe keeps carbohydrates as low as possible: 22 grams per serving (.75 cup). it does provide folic acid and 25% of your daily recommended allowance of iron; but this is not a substitute for iron pills if your doctor wants you to take iron supplements. this breakfast cereal contains almonds; if you are allergic to any kind of nut please ask your physician before eating this cereal. overall this fantastic breakfast cereal is tasty and it stays crunchy in milk--unless you leave it in milk for over 20 minutes or so. it contains important nutrients but this cereal alone cannot be a substitute for any vitamins your doctor may want you to take. it is priced about right; and the sugar and iron will give you just enough of a kick to start your day. pick some up and enjoy them as much as i do! smile ",positive
" my family and i absolutly loved the sinamon flavor of lesserevil popcorn...great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family. was it healthy? well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure...but it is called lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you good stuff overall and amazon's price is great (just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas ",positive
" delightful popcorn mix which is great for snacks and is a really nice treat for lunches. very tasty and hits the spot for those sweet tooth cravings without being too far off the old diet. buying it here is a bargain too ",positive
" not only does this stuff taste wonderful but it's much healthier than most of the items on the grocery store shelves. i would definitely recommend this as a great snack ",positive
" even though it's all natural the taste is rich with fresh fruit flavor. in this way it's even better than standard dried fruit ",positive
" one of the best varietals i have tasted. smooth and rich almost syrupy like most of timothy's coffees. delicious!! ",positive
" nice flavor and aroma. i like the darker blends and this is a little light but still flavorful. ",positive
" i've tried several different cranberries and these are by far the best on the market. i received these today and had another brand available to taste test/compare. the ingredients listed on each package were the same but bob's has fewer calories and a much sweeter taste. the berries do cost a little more but they are worth every penny. the following recipe is great: 1/2 cup bob's red mill extra thick rolled oats (only brand i use) 1 cup 100% juice apple cider 1-2 tablespoons dried cranberries brown sugar to taste cook oatmeal apple cider & cranberries in microwave approximately 5 minutes. add brown sugar stir & allow to sit 2-3 minutes. add additional cider after cooking if you like a thinner oatmeal. if only amazon sold bob's rolled oats.....

" i bought this on something of a whim - i like some of genisoy's other products - and was worried that it would be terrible. but it really isn't bad! the instructions read: for best results add 1 scoop of powder to 8 oz. of protein fortified nonfat milk and mix in an electric blender or in a shaker. can also be mixed with water or other beverage of choice. i didn't want the extra added calories of the milk - plus i'm lactose intolerant so i went ahead and mixed it with water worried it would be bland. it was pretty tasty. the reason they say to put in a blender or shake is because it's difficult to mix - it gets very thick. kosher status isn't clear here on amazon but it's got a circle-k hechshar if this is relevant for you. and this particular product has many more vitamins and mineratals than the genisoy ultra xt product. i'm going to go out and get the vanilla too. definitely recommended!

" these cookies are unbelievably good. perfect with a cup of coffee or tea; perfect alone. i stopped buying them because i just could not stop eating them. if i could buy them in packs of three or four then i could have them in the house again. ",positive

" tastes great and the price was good ",positive
" i usually hates granola bars. they tend to be too sweet and i am not crazy about the texture. my 3-year-old son's daycare requires all new kids to pack an earthquake emergency kit (yet we live in california) and one of the required items is 10 granola bars. i bought this just to prepare the kit hoping that he would never have to eat them. since the product comes with 30 bars i took some to the office as my emergency stash. they are actually quite tasty. my son also likes them as a quick afternoon snack while we are out and about. never thought we would actually consume them when i bought this but it looks like we will reorder soon. and it's organic ",positive
" i have used this product for a long time as lipton has always been a trusted brand. i do go through a lot of tea so buying it on amazon was quick and more affordable then other stores ",positive
" my family loves this coffee. this decaf is very smooth--it does not have a weird decaf aftertaste and we will continue to order this. it's the next best thing to having kona coffee which we cannot always afford ",positive
" the shells are a nice change from the otherwise limited choices of gltuen free pasta shapes. i will buy these again ",positive
" wonderfully totally delicious.........you don't want to finish the last kernal it's just so popp'n good ",positive
" both adults and kids alike very much enjoyed this popcorn. nice cheddar flavor without any yellow hands ",positive
" i buy this at sam's club for about $12/2#. before i became enlightened re: organic products i was a folgers user. this coffee is a deeper roast and has a higher acid level but is flavorful. for the price this is an incredible deal ",positive
" this tea is comforting when feeling ill or under-the-weather. also it has a pleasant taste. i highly recommend it ",positive
" the grocery store is saturated with products that are high in sugar and fat and frankly i've become weary reading labels. i've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality. nature's path organic blueberry toaster pastries are made organic wheat flour and they are absolutely delicious. they heat up fast in the toaster for breakfast with a cup of tea and are convenient for a snack. i'd go as far as to say these are better than cookies. ~therebeccareview.com ",positive
" i enjoy this cereal with vanilla rice milk. it is good. especially when i eat it which is what i do ",positive
" this fills me up and it tastes very good i only with the box was bigger i can only get 2 bowls per box ",positive
" i have eaten this amazing cereal every morning for a year and i still look forward to eating it. it has an interesting flavor that i know i will never get tired of. i highly recommend trying it ",positive
" this is my favorite cereal i recommend it to everyone i can. i eat a bowl every morning at 9 am and am still full at lunch time. best of all it tastes great. i agree with previous reviewer that the flax seeds are tasty but probably useless as the body can't break down a whole flax seed to obtain the omega-3 but it adds nice texture and nuttiness. also amazon has a great price on this vs. grocery stores ",positive
" this is our favorite cereal. and it's so much cheaper here than at the grocery store. the boxes run out fast so it's nice to have several and not have to buy it at the store all the time ",positive
" i first tried this granola when they had it at costco and since then i was hooked. i was never a huge fan of granola to begin with. i usually liked the taste but a lot of granolas were very hard and crunchy even when eaten with milk. a lot of them were also either too sweet or not sweet enough. so when i tried this granola it immediately blew away all my preconcieved notions involving granola. this granola is what granola should be: not too sweet and easily softened in milk. the flavor is awesome. i have since tried most of the other nature's path granola flavors and they are all pretty good as well but i think i still like this one the best. also this one has omega-3 in it which is good for you. anyway this is definitely my favorite cereal and it must be if i'm going to the length of ordering it on the internet! i just ordered my second 6-pack and i don't think i'm getting tired of it anytime soon ",positive
" like oatmeal - with good taste and texture; a little sweet (i cut it with plain oatmeal) ",positive
" you won't want anything on them either! they are that good. warning - be prepared for quite a number of broken and crumbled crackers from the shipping. ",positive
" excellent product for those on a wheat free diet. have a hamburger again with a real bun! even better if you microwave for 20 seconds prior to eating. enjoy ",positive
" these cookies are very good and you can actually eat quite a few before the calorie count starts to add up. i shared them with some friends and everyone thought they were excellent ",positive
