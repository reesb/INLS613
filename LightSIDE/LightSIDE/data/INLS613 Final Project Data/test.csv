7/5/2017,0,0,276,FALSE,Recommended,"This new update is a step in the right direction. I see a huge improvement in both marketing and design. The lazy pay to play buttons are directly next to the work for it (and still pay) button so it s easy to choose your financial direction which increases sales. But still don t forget to listen to the negative comments as well. They seem to have a huge demand of no Asians or hackers. Although both are fun to play with if your just chilling with friends in my opinion.Pros + Good gun physics and selection.+ Amazing PVP. (FPP is key!)+ Progressive updates. (Some backlash in comments)+ Three good maps and more on the way. (all free)+ Great cars and motorcycles to F*** with.+ Great house models and loot settings.+ Amazing with friends.Cons Apparently to many hackers and Asians. (Asians are fun(ny) I haven t seen hackers) Not as fun without friends. + Although this is improving because of the new level system addition. I m greedy I need more explosions!I think this game could benefit from a free version of the new ""pass"". Just an overall slow and grinding way to get items like every great (or addictive) game out there. But keep the good ""pass"" for the lazy people. I also still must be greedy I want more explosions or fire! Possibly make the gas tanks able to be shot on the ground and thus spreading a perimeter of fire??

3/27/2017,0,0,73,TRUE,Recommended,The points system is a bit rediculous as it costs far too many points for reward crates and the game doesn't give you that many per round. That aside this is a solid battle royal game that will be played and replayed and enjoyed just as much each time.UPDATE. Points are now not being added to my player. This must be addressed.

5/15/2017,0,0,411,TRUE,Recommended,"Want to feel your heart beat in your throat as you hear footsteps in your building?Want the anxiety of not knowing whose in the town your about to enter?Want to feel the thirst for blood as you stalk an unsuspecting player?Want to feel the rush of blood to your genitals as you stand above the body of an enemy that died by your hands? If you answered yes to any of the above then this game is for you. It's all the heart stopping moments of DayZ and engaging fire fights of Arma all without the walking simulator feel. Not only are you fighting for survival but fighting for prime positioning. You're constantly faced by the threat of enemy players as well as the ever shrinking safe zone. You find yourself pinned down in a building. The circle is moving in and you know both you and the enemy player have to make a move for both of you to survive. What do you do? You'll constantly find yourself in a situation of ""what do I do?"" Sometimes your quick thinking will pay off sometimes it won't. Learn from your mistakes and what else you could have tactically done to make it out alive and push on to the next game. My mindset going into an early access game is to not expect 100% polished game play. I bought the game a few days after it's release expecting it's downsides but I have only witnessed frame rate drops and lag 2 3 times lasting no more than a couple of seconds. I have foliage and effects turned to medium and the game runs awesome for me and by no means do I have a top tier PC. The game does have it's small bugs. Jumping can be a little awkward sometimes you'll hit a bump while driving and next you're flying through the air and if you're spectating a teammate sometimes their movements and shots don't render well. MOST IMPORTANTLY The developers seem to respond to the feedback of players quickly and updates take place regularly. Hopefully they keep up with it. How many times have we given up on early access games because a patch or update ended up leaving the game unplayable? *cough DayZ* Seriously I could go on and on about what I love about the game but I'll stop here and allow for you to get the game and experience it all for yourselves. Good luck.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/12/2017,2,11,26,TRUE,Recommended,Product received for free. Pretty much everything I wanted out of the individual titles Rust Arma 3 and DayZ combined into one package. A survival battle royale whose goal is to simply be the last one standing on an 8x8 km island super simple premise but the execution is oh so good. .. The pacing is good enough if you end up surviving till the end of a round it's at most 30 minutes.Recent negative reviews have almost ALL been the fact the developer is monetizing crates.... so what? it's cosmetics... anyone complaining about that has no idea how much game development cost I'm sure the developer is expanding their team and using this system to push more quality updates in the future... furthermore you can literally just buy a crate with the points you earn after game sell it and have enough for the key to that crate (considering this game is the most expensive game with the crate system and getting the crates is based on a reward point system based on getting more points if you survive to the end/kill/hit more/etc the crates stay valuable and there's still keyless crates too.)that said there is one downside to this game I've found and it's a texture loading bug where if you parachute in for the first 30 secs give or take textures and buildings entirely don't load (can literally shoot/walk through them/etc...) super serious bug that can be outright game breaking if you don't open inventory and force load (which will freeze you for 15 40 seconds) do it a moment too soon and someone's already killed you when you landed... It's something that desperately needs fixing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

4/21/2017,0,0,57,TRUE,Recommended,So I bought this game in early access because of all the hallelujah hype.. Now... I can clearly see it has potential but seriously it is way too early in development to even be halway playable for newbies to the genre..I mean its addictive in a wierd way but I have played 9 matches now without a single kill because these weapons are way too buggy for me to use effectively..Even though in my opinion the game is not worthy the hype and twitch fame i would still recommend it because of its potential..EDIT After getting used to the game I think i went a little ahead of myself... After trying teaming up with people via discord i realize how much more fun and tactical it is when u are a squad.Definitively recommend this game even though it is still in its early phase of development.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

4/26/2017,0,0,366,TRUE,Recommended,This is the short and sweet version of most MMO's PVE. It is buggy now but things are coming together nicely. I loathe 3rd person shooters but I love this game. I will update to a full review when the game is released properly.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
5/1/2017,0,0,644,TRUE,Recommended,This game is still in development so if you don't like buying a game that's undergoing development don't buy this. It has bugs glitches etc... But as someone who can look past these flaws when the game runs well which is most of the time it's a really fun and exciting game. No game in the last year has had me sweat like this... You can play with your friends or by yourself. Both options are enjoyable. This game also has a large amount of guns and attatchments unlike its rivals... So there is plenty of variety. The map is pretty big too and it also has unique features on the map so you know exactly where you are. Honestly the way this game is going now it has a promising future ahead especially with its frequent updates. HOWEVER I do feel the price for this game is slightly too high for what they are bringing to the table for new customers. I myself find it worth the money as I have played enough of this to justify my money but the same cannot be said for others. So go cautiously.See you guys on the battlefield デ,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

7/11/2017,0,0,84,TRUE,Recommended,Player unknown battlegrounds (PUBG) is an overnight hit having over 300 000 people playing it at once. This is the top ten most played games at one time on steam. I highly recommend this game. I am already very happy with this game but it being in early access gives me hope that much more will come. The one map so far is a perfect size and is overal amazing. With every game I find something new. The game its self I give 9/10. But knowing it will inprove gives me hope that is will become a 10/10Map disignThe map is very well done and is perfectly sized. There are a couple of flaws that I am surtain will be fixed in the near future. I hope that they will add more maps in the future. But to be fair the one map right now could last me days.Hit boxesWith the game in early access it is sure to have some flaws. Many walls you can scope over end up blocking you shot even tho it is obvious that your gun is over it. For hitting players... Im not sure I havent had any problems with that.WeaponsAs with any game I hope that they will add more guns. This im sure will make this game even longer lasting fun. Also for the new comers dont be afraid to shoot 3rd person.VehiclesThe cars in this game are great but are finicy and buggy. This is the one thing I do have a problem with. I also wish they would add more.Things too addMore SMGsMilitary truckRare RPGMore mapsLaddersWorkshop buildsAbility to send friend request ingame,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
6/26/2017,0,0,30,TRUE,Recommended,"GREAT GAME FOR EARLY ACCESS PROS1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle royale PvP games are mostly in Early Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game PUBG is exactly the opposite.2. Great gameplay concept. No pay to win and no grind to win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.3. Non toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no scoping bozos. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often especially in squad play (e.g. risk your life to revive your mate or run like hell to safety Kill someone and give out your position to nearby players or stay quiet Deciding your next 'safe spot' etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists not too steep and not too lean. 5. A shooting game that applies semi realistic weapon recoil bullet travel time and bullet drop is always appreciated.6. Various vehicles weapons weapon mods clothings and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation.7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV the game supports both FPS and TPS.8. Minor performance improvements can get quite noticeable after several updates. Devs truly are working on the optimization issue. We can look forward towards better performance in the future.CONS1. Currently very performance demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very unstable fps even on high end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum virtual RAMs can't help your 4 gigs RAM PC. In terms of GPU one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from &lt 30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke.The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops crashes and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high end rigs. It happens randomly I don't measure the frequency.UPDATE Although the game is still quite laggy minor performance improvements are already noticeable after the latest updates. I no longer suffer from fps spikes with my GTX1080.2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover but 2 seconds later blood spurts out of your chest you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you but then...okay you get my point3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO's Competitive and Dota 2 you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in game.4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three four RMBs to activate the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game devs better fix this quickly.As a response to the comments' feedback I have to add that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally 1 or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid The controls are NOT reactive horrible for a PvP game.6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to drive7. Door and movement bugs seem to be quite prevalent lately. Whenever I move a step ahead the game throws me back 3 4 steps backwards. Seems to be affecting the entire server whenever it happens. Invisible doors also prevent players from entering a building throwing us outdoors whenever we try to enter a building. Similar to fps spikes these happen randomly. Even though this game has many flaws you won't regret buying it. You can expect this from any early access game! The concept of this game is so fun! You all skydive out of a plane (you choose when you eject) that flies across the island. You loot what you can killing anyone you see. As you continue the boundary of the island gets smaller and smaller forcing players to come closer and closer to each other. If you get caught outside the boundary you will start losing health until you die!Overall I give the game 4 stars for the concept ""addictiveness"" etc. not thinking of the server issues.2 or 3 stars out of 5 if we include the server issues.GREAT GAME!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

6/2/2017,0,0,480,TRUE,Recommended,Good game sometimes. The amount of bugs in this game is too high for anyone to count to. Sticky cars lagging servers hit reg all of the things an early access game would have. Here are the things i hate that aren't glitches 1)Getting a drop with a sniper rifle with no damn scope. I dont see the point of getting a sniper and then not having a scope on it! In CSGO the awp for example it would be like only being able to use the awp just you cant use the scope its 100% pointless.2)UAZ. Being one of the vehicles in PUBG its probably going to be laggy right? A bit maybe but when its a damn military van you wouldn't think a small bump would send it flying head over heels would you? This has happened to me and my friends almost more than the bugs in this game.3)Falling damage and cliffs. Falling damage is WAY too muuch in my opinion. There is a small house on a cliff near the military base and getting down the cliff is RIDICULOUS. Fall damage is dumb as you take about a quarter of your health just tripping a few feet and the cliff is only accessible by a single road. No steps no slope just a road where you can get run over easily if there is a car.For these reasons i think this game should get a 6/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

10/30/2017,0,0,205,TRUE,Recommended,First of all you guys should know what this game is about. Currently it's in early access and there's only 1 game mode which is around 100 players set foot in a 8x8 km wide island. Guns armor equipments you find them yourself. Last one standing wins. There's solo duo and squad mode. Players can choose to play in first person or third person perspective but there's a mode which players are forced to play in first person perspective. I do enjoy the game. It really gives you the excitement that you're looking for and the anxiety during gunfights.Since the game is still in early access there are still some bugs with the server etc but I'm pretty sure the developers will get it fixed soon because it has gotten a lot better than when I first started playing PUBG. A few features will be added soon such as climbing and vaulting. Although the game might sound plain like how it's always the same map 'people might get bored playing after awhile'. I totally disagree with that because so far I've nearly 40 hours of gameplay which I have played hundreds of rounds I never once quitted because I was bored but only due to my bursting eyebags haha. Let's get back to the topic. This game has unlimited possibilities. There are so many ways you can ambush on an enemy and vice versa.Well there's much more to it but I guess I'll close my case for now. Hope you guys wouldn't change your mind after reading all those poor reviews. Keep in mind this is game is still in early access!!!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Which is strange considering its only for ' visual ' items ... that have NO EFFECT in game.. Cept maybe letting you run around in a white outfit which sets you up as a giant target.. So Ignore anyone who has a problem with that.. They are just looking for a reason to cry. There are some bugs some terrible an nasty ones.. but they have been slowly patching them . I have played 50 or so games so far with no bug ' having cost me the game '.. If you have a few friends to play with this is a GREAT experience. Is each battle based on RNG? Why yes it is people cry about lack of weapons an being at the mercy of RNG... Guess what everyone has that same chance.. Its part of the experience! Its like these morons crying about ' there were 4 guys who dropped at the house i wanted '.. well guess what.. its a mechanic.. plan for it.. adjust your plan.. hell the circles are random.. so crying about that is similiar! The whole point is you have what you find an adjust as best you can! For the cost you wont find anything as fun! No progression.. just a different experience every time!

5/29/2017,1,2,759,TRUE,Recommended,So you want to know a bit about battlegrounds before you buy this rather expensive battle royale shooter right?Well I will give you a bit of an insight into the game which might sway your mind about buying this game.Now we have to get past the fact that this is an early access game and has only been given access to the public on steam for 2 months now. So clearly there will still be some mechanics that need to be fixed in the game and I am sure those areas will be addressed as the game gets updated monthly. And yes the game is being updated monthly by it's highly active developers which is a key part of making a great game. This game is like H1Z1 in a way with its same concept of a large open area with weapons and vehicles scattered around and 100+ other players to battle against. There is also a barrier that closes in periodically limiting the area that players on the playing ground can be in. However you still can go past the barrier but it deals damage over time and deals more damage as the game goes on.Now that we've got the kind of blurb of the game out of the way let's get onto the pros and cons of the game so far.(Keep in mind some of these are my own opinions)Pros The game is so thrilling that it brings up your heart rate substantially making it a very intense and exciting game There are loads of weapons to find There is a huge map with tons of houses to loot and new areas to explore Your play style is completely determined by where you drop in the map The developers are updating the game monthly which means there will be new items and fixed bugs every month There is a variety of attachments you can add to your weapons to customise them and get that small advantage over your foes. You have an ability to look round corners to survey the area such as in a house. This stops those pesky shotgun users who hide round corners waiting for their unsuspecting enemies to pass through the door.Cons Aiming can be a little bit finicky sometimes and when you think you hit someone it won't register it. However this is probably being fixed by the developers or is fixed by the time you're reading this. Jumping needs a bit of a rework in game because jumping seems a bit off such as when you try and jump a fence sometimes you make it and sometimes you don't and also you can't jump and move forward Strafing is a major part of PvP combat but the game doesn't really seem to account for strafing and it's hard to avoid fire because you can't sprint left or right and you just slightly move from side to side and you become an easy target. There are a lot of performance issues and network issues due to the amount of players and the amount of servers being used. The game is very performance hungry and will challenge even the best computers. I myself can run the game rather smoothly and my PC is using 16 GB of RAM and the internet says that if you don't have 6 GB of RAM then you won't be able to run it. 6GB would be the minimum and you'd need to have a high level graphics card too such as a NVIDIA GTX 970. Vehicle mishaps are very common and you can be doing very well in game and die to a tiny bump in a field whilst in a vehicle.So overall this game is one of my personal favourites so far. Sure it has its downsides but all games do even after early access but as I said this game has amazing developers who are working hard to fix all the problems the game has so far.The game may be pricey but it's definitely worth it due to its variety of gameplay and heart racing thrills. It will leave you wanting to win so you'll try again and again and again. Thank you for your time. I hope this helped )Update PUBG 1.0 is coming out real soon! Some time in December (Hopefully) Thats with no delays of course.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

3/31/2017,0,0,91,TRUE,Recommended,Best Battle Royale to date.I know we have all said this at some point but still dude this is good. Feels much more polished and just well done than Kotk. What's best is that you can almost always continue to search because you want that lvl 3 on Helm Vest and Backpack. Also there are weapon modifications like bigger mag scope all that. So it really encourages you to continue searching also i feel it's much more easier to find vehicles in this than Kotk you can basically just follow a main road and eventually you'll find one.I know how early access is and i don't know if the devs will become money s like all the others after a while. But currently they are gold haven't done anything yet. I am very satisifed with what i got for the price. I know many may disagree with me on this one but still i'm satisfied. Also if they keep their promises to make this game better it would be amazing (i'm very sceptical of this due to Early Access History)Long Story Short i recommend this. It got depth in searching for stuff and also very great physics in driving also shooting feels impactful. Biggest concern would be the lag but devs have said this is their priority #1.

3/28/2017,0,0,222,TRUE,Recommended,I got H1Z1 played some of it disliked it quite a bit refunded it and thought I just wasn't a fan of battle royal games. Then I see this game on the top sellers on steam and thought it looked pretty cool. Thinking battle royal games weren't by cup of tea I was hesitant in buying it. I ended up getting it obviously and I think I am addicted. Something about this game just satisfies me so much. While gun balance isn't perfect it feels so rewarding getting a kill. While certain areas have better loot than others I still find myself exploring the map for new places to loot. To some the slower tactical pace of the game is off putting but I love it. While I have gotten quite tilted and mad from other multiplayer games like CSGO and mobas like everyone I don't get mad at all playing PUBG. Even when twice in a row I got 2nd in solo almost getting my first win ever (at the time) I didn't get mad. While I find many things great about the game I have experienced as many issues with it as the next guy. Yes optimization isn't the best. Yes I've lagged super hard many times. Yes the game has crashed for me more than once. Remember though this is in early access and as of now hasn't even been out on steam for a week. Also the devs have plans to fix all these things and other problems and has proven themselves apt at making such changes to improve the games. Just put in a team waypoint (apparently on the way) and I don't have much else to ask for. Highly recommend.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

5/18/2018,0,0,1124,FALSE,Recommended,PUBG.. I have a little too much time invested in this game. I love it it's addicting But what a broken POS. With constant lag issue's that to be fair are improving a little with every update it's amazing it made it this far and got as popular as it did. The netcode/optimization issues are finally being listened to a little bit but i personally feel with the money they have made most of those problems should be fixed by now if not perfected.This most recent update basically changed the game completely. Just when everyone got used to the last update they drastically changed things again. Now micro transaction? We all saw this coming.. It's only a matter of time before that one big BR title is going to come out and swallow PUBG whole. Fortnite hurt numbers bad enough as it is.With that being said though and the player base still somewhat holding strong. For the price I say it's worth it.

11/24/2017,0,0,868,TRUE,Recommended,I don't usually often write game reviews but I will tell you something game is simply amazing fun.If you play it with you friends then game is totally terrific but for me it's little boring to play it alone but hey if you want to grind BP points then solo is way to go.This game is all about 60% luck and 40% skill. Aim always helps you but luck factor is damn high here because you never know what is gonna be in the next house what loot and who is gonna be inside (except sound is important you can hear other player's moves). Also second important thing is knowing the map and where to go. So if you have good feeling for orientation on the map then this is also a huge plus.Also game currently game has performance issues for now (on my PC FPS can drop easily but my PC isn't very top notch) game is not that very fluid for now. And I think that game should have at least better looking graph (when you see how game is running not that quite good) but hey nothing is perfect and DEVs are gonna soon release 1.0 release of the game so if you ask me I think it's gonna be worth. I mean I just hope DEVs are gonna make game more fluid for lower/middle end PCs.I recommend this for buying because this game has proved already that's it is worth of the time for playing. Positive things Good replayability VERY fun with friends Current map in early access is pretty good designed + more maps to come Game is developing pretty fast in early access patches are coming frequently Grinding BP points (depends of the player but this is something which pulls you forward to play this game more)Negative things Luck factor (random loot finding other players etc) Graph. should look better Random performance issues/fps drops especially on lower/middle end PCs,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Either way I will do what I can to give my fair and basic evaluation of PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS.Pros+ 8 km X 8 km island.+ 100 people. That's a lot. Right?+ Speaking of ""a lot"". This game has a huge playerbase. + Once you die or win it's quick to jump right into another server.+ Loot such as guns and armour and other spawn related items such as cars and boats are generally randomized. So you almost never know what to expect when going to the same building twice. Last game there was a sweet First Aid there last time. Let's go there again this game! Oh nope this time there's a level 1 helmet this game.+ Both singleplayer and multiplayer are equally strong points in this game. Which mean basically it boils down to whether you prefer to fight on island with 99 other players all by yourself or with your buddies.+ So far the crate system is better than half what I've seen exists out there. It's there merely for cosmetic reasons not weapon or stat atvantages. (or pay to win atvantages if you will)+The shrinking zone circle concept helps give a nice balanced pace to the game. You can still play a good game of being a camper and sniping people. This basically prevents the option of you and people camping at a corner of a map for a long extensive period of time.+ It caters to those with different style of play. I've already mentioned one on my previous ""pros"" point. If you like to find a house bunk in there and wait to pick off people at a distance. You can do that. If you have a more aggressive style of play where you're almost always on the move. that works too. Like hanging out at the edge of the circle or dead center of it? Yup! That works too! Prefer landing in busy places like School or Millitary Base? Or do you like to land in more rural areas? No problem! I've seen various play styles people do and they've won Chicken Dinners all alike!Though it could be because of a bit of luck and skill too that's affecting. I hear occasionally that ""patience"" with the right skill is the key to victory.+ Decent variety of weapons. Unfortunatly I can't say much because I still don't have enough knowledge and experience to say whether the weapon is inherently good or bad or is there some better off in certain situations or does the style of play the player does effects which weapon would be best suited for him/her.+ bullet speed and bullet drops. Which means depending on the distance of your target you you'll have to lead your shots esspiecally if it's a moving target. It's a lovely challenge.+ The physics for the cars in this game can be pretty hilarious sometimes. I'm making fabulous memories with some friends because of this. This could be a con for some people but I'm making it a pro. Some of my favorite moments is some goofy thing that happens with a car.+ Pretty much everything you do builds up to that insanely intense end game fight. Where everyone goes into try hard mode. Kinda like that feeling you get in Overwatch when the payload is on the final checkpoint and is in Overtime. Lol.+ Now includes First Person Perspective as an alternative option to the standard Third Person Perspective. Widening the range of more players who prefer true FPS games.Cons Not nessesarily a huge biggy but I will mention this The points (BP. You use this to buy crates.) system seems to encourage a rather....passive play. What I mean is that you get rewarded a bunch of points for winning a chicken dinner but the points you get very much pales in comparison what you get when getting kills. Which means your only kill could be the very last kill and you would be getting more points than the person next to you who lost and got 10 kills in the entire game. I might be exaggerating but only by a little if such is the case. The game lacks a system where it puts you in servers with players with same or similar skill levels. This could be a good thing but right now I see it more as a con because I'm still somewhat of a noob even after 126 hours. There are some players you face that are just simply beyond your league in headshot skills (It's possible I might be spoiled with games such as Rocket League that has such a system.)Heck I'm still trying to familarize myself with all the weapons because bullet speed and bullet drop stats and damage output differ in each gun. Which also leads me to my next point. Lack of practice range mode or ability to customize your own game. Only selected few right now can make their own servers. At the moment your best bet is just watch Youtube video guides and just practice from lots from trial and error. Unoptimized and clunky with some considerablly noticeable bugs. This con is actually pretty huge. Bigger than all my previous cons put toghther. If you're computer's processor and graphics isn't above average you'll easily be experiecing FPS problems to a point it affects your overall ability to play the game skillfully. You will have to crank all your settings to very low and hope you can play something smooth at that level.Mind you the devs have improved it a little since I first bought the game. But they still have work to do and I hope they continue to polish this game up. and because of this major con I don't recommend this game with players with below average gaming machines. And I'll bet this is partly why the overall review rating for this game is suffering a bit.And bugs in this game could be use some work too. Example sometimes I get weird things happening with opening or closing doors. Sometimes I have door closed and it behaves like a open door vise versa.SummaryOverall the moments you get in this game can be more rewarding than other games but also more punishing because you only get one life. That's it. If you die it's all over. You need to start from the beginning again. Not like a tyipical arcade like setting where you just respawn in a few seconds and get a chance to make a comeback. Every desicion you make counts. And because of the higher risks and more on the line that's what makes it more rewarding when you get kills and chicken dinners. But at the cost dealing with fustrating games too. I've had days with this game where I felt like I was on top of the world then some days that just were utterly fustrating to the point I just wanted to uninstall the game.Even though the frame drops can be a struggle at the end of it all the pros experience in this game outweighs it all for me and is enjoyable enough that I will overlook the issues most of the time.Every game is different even if you're playing the same map over and over again. Giving many hours of replayability. I have a blast with this game! Esspiecally with my friends! One of them whom recommended the game to me! And I don't regret buying it!Thanks for reading my review! )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

4/17/2017,0,0,489,TRUE,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS a semi realistic (compared to ARMA series) battle royale gameI've seen people plays it I've played the game for a few couple games (mostly solo) and as an early access game this game nails it. Now as in many early access games you'll (almost) never gonna get ""the best experience"" from the game immediately since it's still in early development. But personally I had fun and it's just gonna get even better as incoming patch and updates comes. You may confused as you play your first couple games as the lack of detailed information in the UI that I have to check on the control settings to learn each function of the game which is acceptable in this state of early development so yea not really a game breaking problem really you just have to acknowledge that as you commit to buy an early access products.So the game starts as you drop off a plane to decides where you want to spawn then as you landed loot as many resources as you can to survive among 100 players in the same island. Weapon and the attachements varieties clothings laying around for fashion from painfully drivable Sedan to some Jeeps and even a Buggy (all vehicles are gas fueled so keep an eye on that fuel meter) and other equipments to help you survives easier in the game. There's going to be a circle of electrical waves that's gonna force players to take a walk and say hi with each other as the circles gonna starts from the outer island and gets smaller on each waves within visible range and time limit. It's totally random as it could centered at the corner of the map which is cool.There maybe some bugs and stuffs laying around (rubber banding weird latency spikes car flopping around soo high just from bumping a random rocks or bumps) but it's a lot of fun for me personally again.And for performance you might wanna crank down the graphic settings a bit if you're PC build is below system requirments stated as it's still not greatly improvised in technical performance.As for now that's all I can get from this game I personally recommend this game as in this early access state for players who wanna play a decent battle royale game haven't play much of any other BR games so can't say much about that. But yes this game is still fun and challenging despites the bugs and technical problems for now. Can't wait for the upcoming updates and see where the devs gonna take this game.

PUBG has a remarkable prompt patch/update record mostly in line with what their players are requesting.

11/22/2017,0,0,1269,FALSE,Recommended,Update November 2018 Although this game is still far from polished it has come a long way since Early Access. It has a good mix of MilSim action and Battle Royale adrenaline. Some terrain (boulders and rocks in particular) could use hitbox updating Erangel could use some loot buffs and I would like to see pistols buffed but these are minor complaints.

Has a decent amount of bugs but most are fairly minor and don't affect gameplay too much.I would say that it's a great game overall.

10/2/2017,0,0,347,FALSE,Recommended,Alright the game is out of early access.What has changed?Not much really. A new map polished graphics and slightly better performance.I still play the game for the same reasons I played it when I first got it 1) Everyone can win2) The game is heavily skill based at the end of the day3) You have your downtime and no match will play out the same or have the same playersOf course this doesn't apply to everyone. Some might say they play PUBG solely because their friends do it. And you know what? That's fine.In this game I don't care for the players. I don't care how the person who just killed me might look think or laugh about that kill. I queue up for another match and things might play out differently.The replayability is heavily supported by a NONEXISTENT ingame chat (apart from voice which you can turn off which is best LEFT off).Ingame chat and player interaction is what promotes tilting and rage the most. Seeing and hearing a stranger laugh at you or taunt you is one of the worst things that can happen to your dignity in a game. PUBG doesn't have that.The new content is cool and a welcome addition to the game.The map feels more polished thought out and generally more authentic. I've come to like it more than the old map.The weapons have their use and usability BUT The .45 ACP weapons are way too common. It feels like the developers wanted to shove them in your face so you use them more.And one more looting RNG on the new map is ed. And will probably continue to be. There are whole houses with nothing but backpacks and clothing in them whereas you can go to one specific building (you probably know which one) and almost always come out with an AR level 3 gear and MEDs.Of course there are still problems with the game the developers could have been fixing since long.Servers are horrid. The network lag and coding in this game sometimes is more than laughable. Replays are buggy and inconsistent or unreliable.Wanna see how on earth you died there? Oh Replay says he was 2 meters more to the left than where you shot at. Oopsie looks like this was your fault for not shooting right.Who knows which one was correct. The enemy in the replay 2 meters to the left or the enemy you felt like you emptied a clip at?Optimization has improved a bit...?AMD Graphicscards are still heavily underutilized as well as Ryzen and Bulldozer CPUs.However this does not mean you NEED NVidia and Intel to play PUBG smoothly.AMD has been bringing out patches to get their products to run better with PUBG.I was using an RX580 8GB for the majority of the time I spent in PUBG and played on medium to low settings to get smooth frames when things were getting messy.I changed to a GTX 1060 6GB at the start of 2018 and OH BOY have I been having a better experience. Much more frames much better settings.Apart from GeForce Experience (Replay feature) eating frames from time to time leading my game to stutter heavily.Over all PUBG is still one of the best multiplayer games I have played.7.5/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

7/31/2017,0,0,197,TRUE,Recommended,"A game that overall has wonderful potential. The design the guns and the map is well designed. Excited to see more content. Mechanically the game is okay but could use some serious improvement in the network lag problem in game lag not being able to aim down sights clean and a few more tiny problems that will be patched over time. However where this game thrives in the already mentioned I would say its not meant for those who want a competitive experience. It is more of a casual game right now do to the handicap it gives with the current meta and third person for those who need help with these types of games.The current meta of this game is loot get to the circle camp and then move. You could start a game perfect and take gun fights have 10 15 kills and still lose because of ""campers"". The third person is another problem this game would be fine in third person if there wasn't an alt look or prone third personing. Both the meta and third person are intertwined in a problem that even H1Z1 didn't have that this game seems to thrive in. Overall I would give this game a 6/10. While I may be harsh on the meta and camping that doesn't mean you can't win and not have a competitive time but it is the main problem I have had and have seen. My best advice to anyone who purchases this game and I'll even have to take my own advice be patient don't get frustrated and play with friends it makes the experience worth it and it hides some of the issues I have stated above. Other than that this game has a great oppurtunity lets just hope our friends at Bluehole will listen to the community and focus on mechanics/gameplay over content.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/7/2017,0,0,318,FALSE,Recommended,So far Im absolutely loving it. Yes there are a few bugs and lag but this is an early access game keep in mind. I understand the frustration with the crates and breaking their promise to not add microtransactions until the game was done and so I looked into it. The dev blog says that the proceeds will go to Charity Prize pool for tournament The event itselfAND it's also to test out their crate system to see if it works as expected. What if everyone lost their crates or items that they paid for? Thanks to this test they can smoothen out how crates work.TLDR Crates are a test Game is very fun for Early AccessEdit After Hours more I still love this game.

You get to choose where you want to drop and land by jumping out of the plane whenever you want. Also less buggier than H1Z1 and has a better hitreg. Overall I enjoy this game more than H1Z1.

6/20/2018,2,2,27,FALSE,Recommended,"I had to post my review because today I noticed a very large amount of bad reviews.Issue seems to be that they banned a lot of hackers and admitted to accidentally banning some innocent players. Now it appears to me that the guilty hackers as well as probably a few innocent hackers have taken to Steam to complain about how bad they feel this game is.I have an old system. My processor was purchased in 2013 and my video card is a GTX 770. I think I have 12 GB of system ram and I don't have any SSDs.When I first started playing on my sons account about a month ago the only bug I would have was a crash when I opened my inventory occasionally maybe once every other day or so. I fixed this by deselecting the option to show character in the inventory screen and haven't seen an issue since. The ""Bugs"" where you shoot at someone in the mountains and hit invisible terrain or your car hits a small rock or hill that flips or explodes you is common for all games in general in my experiences.Game's graphics and performance on my system are 8/10. It looks as realistic as it can be these days and plays great.The main issue that I have with the game is with the Squad players that want to just jump into high concentrated area like big towns that are along the path of flight so we spend more time on the loading screen than playing. I prefer lasting until at least the top 10 and that is not the best way to ensure I make it there.It is an excellent team game if you find good Squad members.

11/23/2017,0,0,608,TRUE,Recommended,I love battle royale type games. They are rogue like winner takes all paranoid murder fests that require strategy awareness and skill. I have played the precursor to this game the Arma 3 Battle Royale mod and loved it. WIth PUBG/Battle Royale it all comes down to you have one life your choices are important you have to be aware and have a plan that is adaptable. If you screw up put yourself in a place to get ambushed easier fire your weapon when you don't have the upperhand don't stay near your team or drive unsafe you are putting your one single life and that game at risk. This makes the game exciting and interesting but frustrating and anger inducing when things don't go right.When they put PUBG together they took almost all the good bits of the mod and added features/systems on top of that that made the game even better. These additions include better squad games reviving squad members azimuth/compass HUD (better) shooting from a vehicle target hit feedback (with blood mist) fuel for vehicles etc. When the much lauded vaulting mechanic comes it should be a major change to gameplay and tactics. When all of these pieces come together it makes a fun and exciting game that has become very popular. I would even say that this game will end up influencing other leading shooters to incorporate and mimic PUBG and battle royale type gameplay mechanicsWould I recommend this game? Absolutely yes with some caveats 1. You need a good PC to play it even on the lowest settings the game doesn't perform as well as it should2. The game has some bugs that need to be ironed out3. There are cheaters that Bluehole and PlayerUnknown needs to further address4. There are toxic players with mics (which you can mute) The things I wish PUBG had that the BR mod had is a hardcore mode where ammo is tied to magazines that have to be packed and repacked as well as deploying a weapon to steady it on the environment. Scopes that have a red dot on top that you can switch inbetween. A night mode with flashlights and nightvision goggles/scopes. Also the BR mod had vehicle repair kits and one broken helicopter randomly placed that you had to fix and had very little fuel to run. If they could add a heli (or other special vehicles) that you had to fuel to run or that randomly airdrop it would be very interesting to gameplay.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I found a UAZ in a short while and began driving down the road towards the circle. I soon ran into another player in another UAZ I immediately rammed him after which he offered an allegiance. I accepted and we unleashed our inner Mad Max our first fight as blood brothers he flipped a smaller car off the road after which I ran over it's occupant. After that we shared other battles took more lives under our wheels until one fateful encounter. We were driving along a road when from the bushes beside us came enemy gunfire i pulled back around and ran over the assailant but when i drove up to my ally's car i found him dead on the ground. I crouched over his body in grief and fired my bullets up through the rain towards the gods that so unjustly took his life. I will never forget you bloodbrother never.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Basically anyone can play this game but getting kills is not the only thing. It's about surviving. You can win Chicken dinner with only 1 kill too! What you have to do is just survive until the last man.. xD But it is difficult to be last person standing with just one kill. getting into last top 10 players is the best experience you can get. Too many glitches right now since the game is early access. The game is not optimized so there are fps drops even in lower settings.

They're working on a new map. You don't have to wear pants.CONS (As of Early Access 3/28/17) Switching weapons and interacting with world objects isn't smooth (sometimes you have to hit the button multiple times to get the interaction or weapon switch to work). Reloading sometimes doesn't happen especially frustrating when you first find a gun and need to load it. Grenade throwing is extremely slow/feels off. What is up with the really slow end to the parachute landing. Sometimes it's instant others I feel like I'm falling through quicksand. RNG will sometimes get you killed. Friends who only want to land at the school/apartments for that instant death action. Sound overall needs an improvement especially movement/footsteps.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Granted I do not have a ton of hours spent in the game but seeing some other reviews it makes it looks like EVERY game is filled with hackers and from my experience that's obviously not the case.I've even played a couple of times on NA and haven't encountered any hackers either but sadly the ping difference makes it almost unplayable.Now with that said this game is a hit or miss. Either you'll love it or you'll hate it. I'm one of the former.Opimization is not great but it's playable on most rigs and there's still bugs that happens but they are rarely occuring and often minor.

You can dive into a well populated area and kill some fellow players or you can choose to play a little bit more safer and proceed with cautious.The devs are well invested there is a major update every single month new weapons vehicules... and even maps sometimes.I run this game just fine high settings for textures and medium for the rest (it is strongly advised to set the foiliage and the shadows to very low to have a better vision of the sneaky bastards that might stab you in the back). Now that the game is out it's running even better!You can check out my config on my profile.Few people are complaining about lags desync... but I have not encountered any of these problems.

7/14/2017,0,0,193,TRUE,Recommended,Awesome game!This game is very fun and competitive. I have had very few crashes with the game it seems to run pretty smooth. I love the variety of weapons attachments and gear. I also can appreciate the fact that unlike H1Z1 there are lot more vehicles making it more fair to make it to the safe zone if you just so happen to pick a landing spot that isn't very close. My biggest complaint with the game at this point is by far the rewards system. I mean the currency is cool but even after saving and buying the third and fourth pioneer crate I got a pair of pants and a dirty white tank top. I mean ok ok I understand they have to make money and all but at least give us better rewards for winning. I have won multiple games now team and solo and still I just get a liiiittle more currency to buy a pioneer crate only to unlock a dirty wife beater. This isn't gonna keep me from playing but it is a little annoying. Thanks for reading!UPDATE ON THE REVIEWTHE LOOT CRATES ARE STILL ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. you spend your renown points and then have to pay real money for a key to unlock it? Like wut? yes you can still get the ones that are just renown points but what do you get? Garbage. Pants that are common shirts you already have or stuff that is just dumb. I mean I am still gonna give it a thumbs up because i do enjoy to play it but with the complaints for loot and the ones for stream bs are gonna bring this game down.

5/27/2017,0,0,118,FALSE,Recommended,Introduction PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle royale 100 players open world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo duo and squad (3 4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward you hop off a plane loot weapons armors and equipments from buildings and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle royale game out there yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known PUBG has had a highly successful launch securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle royale PvP look no further. You've struck the gold..My claim is not without reason. The following is PUBG's pros and cons in my opinion Pros1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle royale PvP games are mostly in Early Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gatherinng as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game PUBG is exactly the opposite.2. Great gameplay concept. No pay to win and no grind to win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.3. Non toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no scoping bozos. A learning curve definitely exists not too steep and not too lean. 5. A shooting game that applies semi realistic weapon recoil and bullet drop is always appreciated.6. Various vehicles weapons weapon mods clothings and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. 7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV the game supports both FPS and TPS.Cons1. Currently very performance demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very low fps even on high end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum virtual RAMs can't help your 4 gigs RAM PC. One of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from &lt 30fps and extremely slow loading progress.2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover but 2 seconds later blood squirts out of your chest you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you but then...okay you get my point3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO and Dota 2 you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in game.4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three four RMBs to active the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game devs better fix this quickly.6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to driveConclusionDon't lose all hopes because of my cons list remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay but devs are very active in updating the game. I dare to conclude that PUBG is currently the best battle royale MMOFPS/TPS PvP game out there. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing even when it's not on sale.Well that's all I have to say about PUBG. Hope it can be of help to potential buyers!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PUBG has it's flaws but it has a long road ahead of it. Any good game doesn't get developed in just one day. I believe PUBG is the most fun game I've ever played. Yes there are some problems but those problems exist because of the limitations imposed by technologies used in the game.People keep comparing it with CSGO for it's gunplay but they forget that CSGO has max 20 players connected to a server at any time. Whereas PUBG has 100 players connected to a server at a time. Of course it isn't gonna feel same as CSGO. People keep comparing it Fortnite but they forget that PUBG has more realistic texture and effects comapred to Fortnite. Of course there it is not as smooth as Fortnite. But the development looks promising.From its launch in Early Access to as of today PUBG has changed a lot. Devs keep updating the gameplay keep fixing the anticheat keep maintaining the servers. Overall progress is slow but there is progress. PUBG is the most promising game in the Battle Royale genre. I think Bluehole (or to say PUBG Corp) is doing all it can to make game better. Those who know what they signed up for when they bought a game developed by small company like Bluehole give it a ""Thumbs Up"". Others just rage and give it a ""Thumbs Down"".",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game is one of the most usntable and glitchy pre alphas I have ever played. Considering this game is only multiplayer and the fact probably half of the games I play I cant load in. When I do load in the game crashes a lot of the time. Walls are glitchy as hell jump on one and you can be stuck for eternity. The play zones in my opinion are hit and miss sometimes zones will allow for a good fire fight other times players will spend majority of the game running just to be killed by getting stuck on a rock. Angles of vision seem off some players having the ability too see you round corners or over hills when you can look over them (the amount of times I have been shot around corners due to server lag is ridiculous) First aid kits are also too common you can shoot a guy 20 30 times but as long as he has 5 seconds to himself he can keep coming at you like jesus reincarnate.

12/22/2017,0,0,34,FALSE,Recommended,When I started playing this game it was plagued with bugs and issues However the devs have been really consistantly patching and have improved the game by a substancial amount. A few months ago I may not have recommended this game but now I cant recommend enough. I would get some friends on board though because this game isnt even half as fun playing alone or with strangers. (most of the time)Pros The game features some very realistic sounds and the directional sound is as much a mechanic of the game as movement. Great job with that.The mechanics of the game are very good always keeping you moving and questioning your next move. Its very pretty in terms of graphics. Its quick to pick up and hard to master. There is a large amount of skill involved in getting good at it.Game is in continual development so a lot of new content is getting released monthly so far.Bullet drop and bullet damage is pretty consistant Ive found. Learning the different guns is a challenge but youll soon find your favourites.Its a great game to play with friends most of the time. It can suck when you die at the very start and have to wait for everyone else. But sometimes youll spectate the funniest things.Good inventory system.Very accomplishing when you do get that chicken dinner.The cons The game still has some bugs mostly with vehicles and interaction button (F) however the devs are pretty quick to patch em out.The damage you take from vehicles is infuriating. Its a one hit kill most of the time and there is no roll implemented in the game at the moment so vehicles can be OP at times. The driver can then loot your stuff with no damage to it unlike when you are involved in firefights.The controls can be clunky and there are quite a few of them. When you start playing its quite a large learning curve in this aspect.The quick pick up mechanic (F) is clunky at times and actually hinders you in a rush.There is no free customisation to character When I started I didnt know this and just accepted the default look thinking I could change cosmetics later. This is not the case.Flash hider compressor and silencer are not entirely accurate to how they perform in real life and there is almost no difference between the angled grip verses the handle grip it terms of accuracy.Sight distance even at full in settings isnt very good yet. When you are sniping with an 8x scope or higher you can see the full details but when its drawn in while you move positions or reload you generally will lose your mark in a green blur.No roll mechanic. They have implemented the climb mechanic recently but there is still no roll mechanic. It may not ever get released in the game but I feel its needed if they continue to have a one hit kill against vehicles.Overall This game is great and well worth the purchase if you are planning to play with friends. The interactions you have with randoms is well random. Some people are overly cooperative others will kill you to get the gun you just picked up. Some people suck at the game but are funny to have around others are just the worst people imaginable but are amazing at the game.The fast paced machanics and the feeling of getting that chicken dinner will keep you playing even if the game is full of bugs. You'll have the greatest highs and the worst lows while playing this game. 8/10 chicken dinners from me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

4/18/2017,0,0,296,TRUE,Recommended,"I'll start off with an in game moment that got my heart pumping I start off sitting in a plane as per every match waiting for my two other buddies to pick a spot to drop in on and start the hunt for weapons. They drop...I drop a little late. They yell through the mics where they are heading but I fall short. A broken down temple surrounded by ruins separates me from my comrades...I see 3 other players (enemies) drop within the ruins surrounding me.I hit the ground and instantly scramble searching for a weapon unable to find anything. My friends tell me they can't make it to me until they do the same and that it would be a few minutes. I hear footsteps near me...I run and hide and see two guys run past me. I wait for them to be outside of earshot and run the opposite direction into the center of the ruins. Moments later I find a double barrel shotgun and 10 shots. The second I turn around one of the two I had seen earlier pops around the corner with an uzi. Too far away for the shotgun to be of any use I try to dodge the barrage of bullets getting hit until I'm at a sliver of health. He has to reload...I charge him with my shotgun and unload two into his head. I can't believe I made it...Then his friend comes around the corner charging me with a crowbar (he must have not found a gun yet). At this point a pebble thrown at me would kill me...I hadn't had a chance to reload either so I run around a corner and end up cornering myself. I start reloading...the guy is within a few feet...one hit and I will be dead...Then a split second before he swings I unload two shots into his chest as he falls in mid stride to the ground mere inches away from me...I meet up with my buddies and wonder what will happen next...It's experiences like these that really make me appreciate this game. I am not saying it is perfect in any way it has a few glitches (nothing I would find game breaking but this is my personal experience) but for how recently it was released it runs very well. Also I have yet to have a bug or glitch (besides perhaps disconnecting from host once) affect my experience.Recommend to those who play The Culling H1Z1 King of the Hill DayZ (For style of combat I find PUBG to be very similar)Pros Guns feel realistic (bullet drop spray recoil etc) Fun competitive play with Duo and Squad options (I personally prefer playing with friends over solo but solo is still fun) The game does provide a ""Rank"" System if you can call it that with the ability to acquire cosmetic items (at random) with in game currency acquired from doing well in matches. It gives some motivation for coming back and playing more matches.Cons FPS Rates are not always constant I hear this quite a bit but it doesn't affect me terribly. I am using a 960GTX no the game does not look pretty at that but I get a consistent 60 FPS with occasional small lag spikes. Matches CAN be quite long occasionally. You can pretty much choose the length of a match based on where you drop. Reward System As mentioned earlier it does provide cosmetic items that you keep permanently from match to match however ALL the cosmetic items you can get in a ""crate"" (what you purchase outside of a match) can be found within a match on the ground. It seems to defeat the point of spending your hard earned currency on clothes that anyone can find on the ground in a match. No they don't get to keep it after the game ends but you get what I mean.To be honest if you have been looking at the game for awhile watched the gameplay seen what it has to offer and are on the fence. Just jump over to the side where you actually buy it I promise you it is a lot of fun and you will lose hours upon hours of your life to it!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I tryed H1Z1 and somehow I like it more because it was more fluent to play smoother... but rapidly I started to noticed how arcadelike and limited it was... but started to get the hang of the battle royale games .. came back to battlegorunds one more time.. and wow finally saw the light... still abit clunky in the movement but so much deep and enjoyable as h1z1 in my opinion.So actually yeah I changed my mind and I have a good time with it.I would only like to see my achvements in a better way like H1Z1 preseason showcase where i See my best matches.. here the stats has a rather underwhelming presentation... also no progression feeling.Old Review First time playing this kind of game.The movement it s very clunky compared to other first/third person shooters.Gameplaywise I dont like how after 5 minutes already the play area starts to get reduced so if you happen to be at the edge of the map at the beginning you almost have no time to looks for weapons and gear as you have to start running towards the middle. In my opinion we should have at least 10 to 15 minutes before start reducing the play area.This game could have a good potential after a couple of more months in development but at this stage and for 30 dollars i dont see it being worth it. On the other Hand a lot of other people seems to enjoy it... so my opinion doesnt seem to align witrh the experience with other people.. I may be missing something.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I play pubg with my brothers every night as well as my friends and it was certainly a factor that contributed to our bondings with each other. From ragdoll glitches to baiting using various methods it was a well worth journey with pubg. I started this game out during early access and boy it was so unoptimized that I was running on a 30fps and lower. I am thoroughly surprised by the optimization that they put in gradually and I highly question those reviews that emphasize how unoptimized the game is. It is a heavy duty game so don't write how unoptimized the game is when you have a low end pc.I have a 1060 and I run the game smoothly on max graphics with 60 80 frames.Secondly I would like to say something about the cons of this game the game itself started out with two FREE crates ""Survivor and Wanderer"" as well as one paid craid ""Invitational"". However the crates that are currently available are highly populated by paid crates causing my whole inventory to be filled with paid crates while having zero keys. I understand the business behind the decision but it is in no doubt a factor that ruins the overall experience of the game.

The game is 100% worth it's price even in it's current state.Note to people reading reviews on this game on Steam This game has an absurdly toxic community of reviewers playing it for thousands of hours and giving negative reviews because they mix feedback with reviews.

But this game has some flaws such as horrible desync in matches the ability to play on servers with high ping which makes gameplay frustrating the item drops need to be fine tuned slightly and the worst of all the ""Sanhok Pass"". This was a quick cash grab for those who want more customization. It was released too early with an army of bugs and no major patches as of me posting this. There are quests that done count progress are insanely difficult and time consuming and worst of all the items for ""free players"" cant be unlocked after level 16 of 30 if you bought it on day 1. The maximum progression points you can earn daily is 200 for free players and you need 400 to level up 1 time some rewards just give you extra xp towards your level and you gain exp based on how long you survived not the placement or kills you get. The crates system is an ok addition because about 25% of crates in this game can be unlocked without using in game keys you need to buy with real money so I don't have a problem with it.

7/3/2018,0,0,9024,FALSE,Recommended,Source IGNPlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds didn t invent the last person standing formula that s made it one of the most massively successful PC games in history but over the course of a nine month long early access period it certainly turned it into something special. 100 players drop onto a sprawling map and fight to the death using whatever weapons they can find within a shrinking force field. This simple bare bones take on the Battle Royale style deathmatch foregoes the fluff and high time investment of most hardcore survival sims in favor of fast accessible action. The result is a tight focused no frills experience that s as exciting as it is unpredictable and where no two games are ever alike.PUBGwastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as you and up to 99 other players airdrop onto one of its two 8x8 km maps from the back of a large aircraft. Part of the genius of each match s arc is how heavily it weighs every move you make and it begins with the critical decision of where to land. Jumping early along the plane s randomized flight path lets you hit the ground first giving you a jump on the competition but risks placing you farther from the parts of the arena where the fighting will likely funnel as the boundaries contract. Jumping late might distance you from other players giving you some early breathing room and a chance to forage for loot in peace before entering the fray. Depending on the angle of the flight path jumping right into the center especially in large cities and other loot heavy spots could place you right in the middle of the action with some of the most trigger happy opponents.The tension mounts during the descent as you get a good look at the swarm of players in your vicinity but things really pick up the moment you hit the ground as everybody (no matter where you land) scrambles for weapons and gear and the killing kicks off right from the get go. Item distribution is partially randomized and learning the spots on the maps that are likely to spawn military grade weapons and attachments is a good early strategy to work out on your own with a team of up to four or using the many fan made resources that already exist thanks to PUBG s hearty run in Early Access. You can t count on finding a good gun early to keep you safe but unlike similar games like DayZ where you could potentially go long tedious stretches without finding a weapon there s bound to be something worth picking up no matter where you drop. Backpacks for holding more items a handful of protective gear like helmets and police vests medical supplies melee weapons and a good mix of firearms are in good supply.But no matter what gear you find PUBG excels at creating a reliable and streamlined space for your adventure to play out while also allowing for a thrilling level of unpredictability. It isn t out of the ordinary for someone with only a pistol to take down someone with a fully loaded SCAR L assault rifle since good gear is only half the battle the other half is wit.As players outsmart each other in deadly games of cat and mouse those still standing are forced into ever closer proximity within the confines of a deadly shrinking force field until just one player or team is left alive. Victory (accompanied by the coveted Winner winner chicken dinner! screen) is an exhilarating reward matched only by the suspense that emerges from the battle to achieve it. But even if you die early jumping into a new game is always quick and easy. In the ZoneThe deadly moving force field that contains the arena and occasional airstrikes marked with red on the minimap add a consistent sense of purpose that drives you toward conflict and with it an exciting set of options. You might want to prioritize reaching the center of the circle to make the next incremental reduction in size of the survivable area easier to deal with move slowly along the borders to pick off stragglers as they rush into the open to avoid the oncoming doom or even hide in a building until you absolutely have to move letting everyone else kill each other so you don t have to. Hopping into a vehicle like the speedy but vulnerable motorbike and buggy the sturdy closed top UAZ or the slow but durable van among others is a quick fun and conspicuous way to cover a lot of ground and can result in some hilarious and explosive encounters. Either way you re encouraged to stay on the move but still have a set of options that lets you pick your pace. An aggressive approach is just as viable as a cautious defense and the practicality of both playstyles is refreshingly liberating bringing new sets of challenges that are just as fun to plan around and tackle as the next.The incentives to stay on the move no matter your chosen pace forces ever more dangerous encounters with increasingly skilled (or lucky) survivors condensing the action and ending a match after around 20 minutes before it can get bogged down by campers or other distractions. Action isn t hard to find if you re looking for it and impossible to avoid for long when you re not but PUBG manages to put enough space between encounters to keep those quiet tense moments of cautious exploration intact.The two large maps aren't the best looking environments in gaming but they do provide much needed variety on the battlefield. Both the forested island of Erangel and the sunny desert of Miramar boast an assortment of small towns large dense cityscapes and rural industrial zones ripe with loot. There are some parallels between maps so as not to restrict your options when you re dropped randomly into either one (the server picks for you). For instance the small military base on an island off the coast of Erangel sees its match in Miramar s remote military camp for the high risk players looking to compete for high level equipment right off the bat.But both maps have their own unique merits too. The abundance of trees on Erangel provides plenty of cover even for groups of four while the sparser rockier Miramar makes moving across open areas on foot and in vehicles much more dangerous. While some areas in Miramar feel more isolated than even the most secluded spots on Erangel the diversity of elevations more interesting city layouts and some great map exclusive weapons like a sawed off shotgun that fits conveniently in the sidearm slot more than make up for it. Adapting to new challenges and making last minute decisions based on each of these factors is part of the fun. But no matter what you re facing an abundance of loot in even the smallest buildings in both maps ensures hunting for a weapon is never a frustrating task which not only keeps the playing field balanced and fun for everyone but ripe for all sorts of thrilling confrontations.You might find yourself involved in a frantic shootout in the woods or on either end of a deadly hunt across a dense city or town. You might even find yourself holed up in an attic listening for the slightest creak or scape to indicate a nearby presence shotgun in hand. The use of sound to build tension and alert you to nearby enemies is one of the ways PUBG forces you to stay attentive and tactical rather than treating every round like a fast paced shooter à la Call of Duty or Battlefield. Play long enough and you can learn the subtleties that tip off when another player has been in a place before you an open door or an unusually dense or sparse pile of mismatched loot are telltale signs you should watch your back. All these layers merge to build a shooter that s invested in creating smart nuanced survival and understands how even the smallest moments of your story build up to create the larger adventure.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I asked him how it was and he said ""great""...I had extra $ in my steam wallet and decided to give it a try...ReviewThis game is actually really good. To be honest I worry if they are going to change it too much they could ruin it. The spawns the balancing are really good. The ambient is also well done and it feels the way it should be. I can't say about performance but it's doing fine for me.One of the things I like is that you can approach the game in different ways. You can find a nice rifle prone in the bushes and snipe or wait for people to kill each other and only engage towards the end or you can shoot people up without hiding risking more but getting more points if you pull it off.Dev feedbackThe only few things I'd suggest to the developers...1. Increase the time before the 2nd and the 3rd circles. It feels like they go too quick for how small the area is. You're literally fighting more against time than players.2. Randomize circles locations a little more...there are areas I still haven't explored because the circles are usually in about the same areas. Also...very important...avoid bridges towards the ending circles. At that point it's literally all about good rng...if you're on the wrong side of the bridge you either get sniped or die outside of the area.3. Very simple but please add a voice chat volume slider so we don't have to stand kiddos screaming in their mic at the beginning of each round.4. Later on please add more maps. I can see myself getting bored of the same map eventually.5. Most importantly don't change too much. The game is really good.

3/31/2017,0,0,106,FALSE,Recommended,It is difficult to describe why the open nature of this world s huge map plus its realisticly modeled weapon mechanics and urban environments(with every building being enter able) create some of the most intense moments in gaming I ve ever had so I will describe two of the situations that I ve found myself in while playing this game. These sequences are not scripted not carefully crafted by an omniscient developer but are a result of dynamic emergent gameplay that this game delivers often. 1)I am looting a small house managing to find a Beretta pistol and a single magazine s worth of ammo before hearing the roar of a car engine driving nearby. I crouch and peek out the windows just in time to see a dune buggy stop its driver get out and run purposefully towards the building. He is holding an M416 rifle and wearing a welder's helmet. Terrified I sprint into the bathroom and close the door hoping to hide. I hear the front door open and his footsteps as he clears each room of the house probably searching for ammunition. I kneel in front of the bathroom door every sense on alert my heart about to beat its way out of my chest as his footsteps get louder and louder and the bathroom door swings open. There is a perfect silent moment as he stares at my character too surprised to react that is abruptly broken by the sound of me emptying every single round I had of 9mm into his chest panicking and not ceasing fire even as his lifeless body slumps against the wall. I had inadvertently set a trap not one out of careful planning but one of desperation.2) As I am sprinting across a hill top carrying my beloved SKS I hear the snap crackle pop of a rifle round breaking the sound barrier as it whizzed by my ear. Judging by the faint gunshot report I concluded the shooter was at an extreme distance and I ran and hid behind a tree. Many rounds hit the tree s trunk and I even took a couple hits to the shoulder as I cowered behind it and using the 3rd person view I surmised he must be in a nearby church s tower using the same thought process of Private Jackson in Saving Private Ryan That s where I d be. Leaning over from cover I aimed and fired into the tower but since I only had the iron sights I had no idea if I was hitting him or not. I cowered behind the tree and hoped that he would get bored and find something else to do. After 5 minutes of patient hiding I sprinted out to the church and not a soul was to be found. I never knew who was firing at me or what happened to him. The more I play the game and the more I ve learned about the importance of stealth it is likely that another player drawn to the sound of gunfire ended up taking him out.Is this game perfect? Not quite I have been randomly disconnected from servers and it needs optimization. However the moments in this game are unlike anything I ve ever encountered in another game before other than something like DayZ. These moments are the reason why Battlegrounds is already a resounding success and if what I ve described to you sounds like a good time I recommend picking this game up and join in the fun.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Playing with friends with voice comms always gives me my share of laughter but playing solo is the real deal though. When you reach that top 10 in a solo match your heart is racing you are listening carefully thinking hard watching the circle and all that just to get your hands on that delicious chicken dinner. This game still needs lot of optimisation because even with a 1050ti and an i5 4th gen I see a lot of fps drops and a lot of times the building textures fail to load after parachuting. Even with these issues the hype train about this game is real. 2 million concurrent players on Steam in not a small deal. I am excited about the future of this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's got fantastic shooting mechanics a highly rewarding Battlepoint and win system. There's nothing quite like getting a Chicken Dinner in this game as opposed to any other shooter and I don't know why. This game does have a few genuine problems unlike irrelevant issues that people bombard the review section for like adding paid crates (they went to funding the tournament and whatever was left over was going to charity) stream sniping bans and banning those who edit the configs or use macros. The real problems with the game are the extreme unoptimization. I rock a GTX 1060 6Gb i5 4690k 16Gb of DDR4 RAM an it's on a 500Gb SSD yet I'm only getting 60 90fps with Mediumish settings. There's the lack of ping lock which allows people from other regions to use their lag to an advantage in game. There's an abundance of cheaters though I've only come across about 10. There's a whole lot of bugs but I haven't come across any other than the default to Asia bug. Overall though this game is really consistent and tons of fun but you really do need a pretty good rig to run this game decently. If you have a good rig I highly suggest you pick up this game. It's got first person and third person modes allowing those who prefer either perspective to play alone though for third person mode you can switch between first and third freely. As I said earlier the gunplay and replay value is really the best parts of this game. The RNG based gameplay keeps weapons fresh and fun and makes sure there's always opportunities to use each weapon. The Blue Force Field is always comepletely random and so are the random special crate drops and deadly Red Bomb Zone making sure every match is an entirely different fun experience. In short this game has it's issues though they're almost completely overshadowed by the overwhelming amount of fun you'll have playing this game and I highly recommend anyone with a good rig buy this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
12/21/2017,1,6,325,FALSE,Recommended,"I've been playing the game since it first ""came out"". But now that it had its official release today i decided to write a review about what improved and what didn't.Because it seems like this game is having a bad time when it comes to reputation at this moment. The reviews are mixed and people are p*ssed about the fact that it was released being in the state it is currently in. And i can totally see that. The game is still buggy to some degree and f*ck i wouldn't really call it stable.Still all the time i've been playing there was only one issue that really got me mad...and that is the performance. To even scratch the 60 FPS i had to put all graphic options down and hell it was still dropping to 40 at points.But since the big update today it runs smoothly at a constant 70 FPS on Ultra. And that they added the climbing really changes the Gameplay in a good way.The new map is debateable. I'm not a fan of desert areas at least not in games. They don't appeal to me visually and always feel bland. Though i must say that after seeing the same map and places for over 200 hours this change is quite refreshing. They overall worked on the visuals and the whole game just looks better now.But again i'm still having the weird bug of building needing too long to load. So long that people have enough time to get weapons while i can't do anything. That destroys some rounds and is just frustrating.Then there is the problem that sometimes even if the buildings load fast enough (Hallelujah) the character just kind of refuses to pick up stuff. (Might both be because my internet is a big C*nt at times i dunno)Last Words PUBG is far from perfect and i do know that. But after games like DayZ or H1Z1 i wasn't expecting this to be perfect. I'm not sure if they should've gotten out of early access today since it still needs a lot of improvement. But it's fun and that's the only thing that matters. Be honest here if you wanted a ""perfect"" and ""great optimized"" game you wouldn't even look at this kind of game. I just wanna say All the negative reviews are right but don't be scared of it having them. It's enjoyable and changing in a good way (at least how i see it). And if you are into these Battle Royale kind of games this is most likely the best option right now.Truly a f*cking Hate Love.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The start of the game I found a nice M4 Custom it helped me all game with a x4 Scope and Red Dot that I switched in between. This gun is great in close range and long range so if you find it you won't regret it.Overall the game runs great I upgraded to a GTX 1050 just so I could play this game smoothly. Gameplay is really fast paced time is your biggest threat(along with players who land beside you). The servers have a bit of latency so you can get hit even when behind cover you really need to learn to play around this. There are lots of diffrent guns all with their own stats on range and damage. Snipers are crazy one shots sometimes even with a level 3 helmet.The map is quite large and you'll never see the whole map before the first circle alot of buildings and cities are scatterd around the map. There are also lots of open fields which you should avoid as much as possible.The only thing that can stop you from finding weapons is the RNG on loot. I have found no weapons and only attachments or random ammo inside lots of buildsing so get lucky!I really enjoy playing duo matches and look forward to playing in Squads which are made of up to 4 players.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

All the reviews pointed me out of the direction of this game as do most with early access titles. But PUBG was different...After a few cocktails I said screw it and picked up the title. BOYY! The heart renching adrenaline that I got while playing is what kept me addicted. Even with the heavy stress for mediocre graphics and the Pixelated late loading houses I couldn't get enough! People is really what makes this game fun. Sure the map may be the same but every game is different and depending on where you jump options are endless.Graphically the game is decent. Well rounded and doesnt shy away from details. Although The memory tole that the game takes will have you wanting to get another 8 gigs of ram if your sitting on 8 already or god forbid 4. As with most games loading time can be a pain if your running off of a HDD but this can be heavily reduced by purchasing a SSD.Bugs are not as big an issue as they were previously and the developers fix issues regularly.

A lot. Yes the game has issues as of now. It is not yet well optimized. It does have hackers and cheaters. There are still bugs around.All three of these issues must be mentioned.But The game is early access and the developers (as every developer team would of course) are saying they're working on optimization. Right now they're pushing for the first stable version they call it PC1.0 coming out in a few weeks. For a lot of players that behave a little like toddlers that's not enough they want daily optimization updates.Hackers/cheaters are getting banned every day. By the thousands and tenthousands.The bugs I encounter have not cost me my life over the last few weeks anymore the physics are sometimes still wonky especially in cars but they're fun as heck.Is there still A LOT of work to do for the developers?

So it seems to me that the Devs do look after the loyal honest players.. While the game does glitch out a little and crashes every now and then. You cant expect much more from a game in early access. Yes the game could go with a couple new maps vehicles and weapons as the game can get a little boring after long periods of playing at one time. Devs need time.

7/17/2017,0,0,232,TRUE,Recommended,Ok so i absoloutly love this game to bits hence the high amount of playtime that ive got on this game. Graphics are quite good but the performance is the proplem which brings to have to lower my graphic settings to very low and ive got a decent graphics card (GTX 960) so i shouldnt really be expierencing fps below 60 but sometimes it goes down to 40 with high settings. I personaly feel like the hit regestration is quite terrible and that i find my self missing alot of shots that ive lined up perfectly on perfectly still targets. Another problem that seems to be going on in this game is me geting shot right after ive gone behind cover which absoloutley should not be the case alright?Over all i would rate this game a 8.5/10 (pretty high score in my opinion) we will just have to wait for the developers to optimise the game to a proper state. But! for 30 dollars the game is not at fault and plus it is in alpha state after all and has provided much more content than its rivals such as H1Z1 (which is a terrible game btw). All and all a very good game for the price tag. Thank for listening/reading my 2 cents on the matter. It has been i ''HippityHoppityWomenAreProperty''.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

3/29/2017,3,3,543,TRUE,Recommended,My friend leads as we exit the three story building. With body armor backpacks helmets 5 kills under our belt already we sprint out congratulating each other as conquerers of the town. Ten seconds later we round a corner of a nearby building.My friend is slain by a shotgun shell to the face. I fire back with my M16 tagging the enemy quite heavily. The solo murderer of my ally quickly flees likely looking to tend to his wounds. I pursue him with intent to make him pay for my fallen brother.I see enemy is in a corner gun pointed at the ground attempting to bandage himself.I shoot off a shell from my shotgun.He falls.I loot the enemy for his ammunition and meds and quickly flee the scene silently mourning my friend's death. I promise to him that I will win this battle royale and avenge him by taking out all the enemies that I see. Not too long later two players enter the outskirts of town on a buggy. I hide behind a corrugated metal wall watching their movements as they enter a two story building with a balcony facing my direction. It must have been over 2 minutes before they decided to show themselves again. One of them opens the balcony door and crouches behind the balcony wall obscuring everything except his helmet covered head from view.I decided to take my chances and open fire with my M16. I walk out from behind cover exposing my entire body while madly tapping my semi automatic rifle hoping to get a lucky headshot on the enemy.Some of the bullets whiz past his head while the rest embed themselves among the balcony wall. He and I both know I am nearing the end of my clip. As I run out of bullets and start to reload he stands up and sprays his bullets toward me. I run and jump back to cover unscathed. After I reload I walk backwards and retreat taking potshots at him so he cannot fire back. I duck and weave through buses and broken walls.I do not flee.I look for an optimal position to take another battle.The enemy soon grows restless as one of them walks out of the building searching behind walls and buses looking for me. His path leads him to me crouched under a wall watching his every movement.As soon as he gets near I stand up and end his life with another shell from my shotgun. I once again reposition myself as his ally will be looking for me. I find another wall to hide behind and try to locate the second enemy.I see the player timidly walk out of the house. He reluctantly searches the area not wanting to get killed in the same way his partner had been. He certainly has no idea where I am but I can clearly see him opening the huts nearby. He crouch and slowly creeps up to the side of a hut that has a door facing me. He is holding a shotgun aiming it at the door oblivious to what is about to happen to him.If he goes to open the door I will have the perfect chance to take him down from behind. He does exactly as planned.I walk around the corner of the wall and get behind him. He opens the door of the hut.I point the shotgun to the backside of his head and I fire.He falls.The entire town is silent. I am victorious in my battle and left as the sole conquerer of the town. However I do not feel like I have won as I think about my fallen friend. WIth 65 players remaining the road ahead is very long.I take a deep breath and leave the town mentally preparing myself to face the future combatants on my own. 10/10 No other game has been this exciting for me and my friend so far.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is a controversial thing though that the developers will ban you (from the forums) if you complain about the hackers in this game. There aren't many of them (yet?). Everything feels pretty balanced aside in this game and it's what I've really grown to love. If you have a shotgun it's generally considered a pretty weak early game weapon however in the late game you can use it in close quarters and still one two shot someone making it scale pretty well. The game has quite an Arma feel to it (because the game oridinated from an Arma mod). On my high end PC I'm getting none of the issues people are complaining about other than server lag every now and then (but they're making efforts to fix it).It's a good game that keeps getting better because unlike most early access developers they're actually updating it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

12/8/2017,1,3,326,FALSE,Recommended,Before I start I'll state this clearly. Yes this game is broken in a lot of ways there's some optimization issues there's a lot of server issues there's a lot of things that need to be fixed. But here's the thing when you actually play the game you'll somehow overlook these flaws because of how fun the game actually is. I've had an absolute blast playing this game after getting it as a gift from my friend. Despite being from Asia I can play on NA servers with ease however there is rubberbanding in the early game.You'll see a ton of negative rewiews about how the game is broken etc. But if you check out the people that typed the rewiews you'll see that they're still playing the game. That's just how fun it is. Even if you hate it you won't stop playing it.The developers are actually working hard on this game despite what people say. I've seen it with the 1.0 patch and the instant perfomance boost I got from it. I'm not kidding it blew me away how much smoother the game ran for me with that update. The new map and other content with it was also amazing.This game has exceeded my expectations since it didn't follow the early access death trap route.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/4/2017,2,3,34,TRUE,Recommended,mmmmm bad. Based on my previous experience with this game I have come to conclude that the character development in this game is truly awful. While initially appearing as mysterious and confused the protagonist is an incredibly one dimentional figure who does little else than loot dead bodies for valuables exploiting the unfortunate deaths of others not once coming to terms with their own mortality. In addition to this the supporting characters are bland murderous amalgamations of cowardice and hatred who fail to effectively convey the deeper meaning of this game. Although the storyline had great potential it was overshadowed by the vapid interactions between the unfaceted and unlikable characters. Also I got sniped by a guy hiding behind a door. 0/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

What you receive A third and first person action survival shooter that throws you into battle with 99 other players A fix for your craving for intense squad battles really fun with friends free kitchen utensils which can also be used as a shield against incoming gunfireWhat might bother you Microtransactions in its current state of development (Doesn't bother me too much but apparently they promised otherwise) Low tick servers client side computing for some features (necessary for games of this size) Not quite optimized yet for all machines Overall I can say that my view on Early Access hasn't quite changed but that I may need to look at every title individually and go from there.It's a fun game and definitely worth your time.

4/21/2017,0,0,665,TRUE,Recommended,Note that the following Review is based of my Experience. Many of you might agree or disagree but this is just my personal opinion. You will love this game if you like one or more of the 3 following games DayZ The houses are similar and the loot is not that easy nor hard to find. The looting part of this game has a DayZ feeling definitely. The Graphics are similar aswell.Rust When I find a weapon and add scopes to it (especially the snipers) i get so excited. Just like in Rust. I feel like i am ready to go and kill as many people as possible. The combat system reminds me a bit of Rust aswell. H1Z1 KotK/Arma BR The Positives of the Battle Royale Gamemode on both of these games. PlayerUnknown made the Gamemode for both of them anyways. Now many people have an issue with the Lag. It really depends on what kind of PC you have. If you check the Devs' posts you can see that they are doing their best to improve the Performance. If you are not sure whether to buy this game or not because you think it might lag i would say wait a couple of months and see if people with Specs similar to yours see any improvements. There are many bugs and Performance issues in the game i agree. But keep in mind that it's still in Early Access.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

11/19/2017,0,0,174,TRUE,Recommended,When I first purchased PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds after months of being pushed by my friends to get it I thought it was going to be a grave mistake of mine. However my expectations were completely flipped around 180 and I can't say enough about this game. I don't have many hours in the game compared to other hardcore players but I feel like I've played it enough to give a solid analysis. My experience with PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is akin to no other game of it's type that I have ever experienced. It is an addicting game that has refined the Battle Royale genre and rakes in thousands of new players by the week. The fundamental concept is easy to grasp You and 100 other players fly in on a plane and drop down to locate and capture supplies and take each other out one by one until you are hopefully the last one standing in the end. The amount of variability and variety in each new match you play makes this game GREATLY replayable. This replayability is greatly enhanced when playing with friends as close quarters firefights quickly become nerve wracking when ammo becomes scarce and medical supplies are sparse.There is a wide variety of gamemodes in the game beside the usual single duo and quad matches. These types can also be mixed and matched with First Person Only servers which makes everything seem more up close and personal. As with any game in Early Access there will be skepticism the 1.0 release is nearly upon us and this will bring not only many bug fixes and new features but new vehicles and a fresh new map as well. I can only imagine how this will factor into making this game a much more solid polished and refined experience in the not too distant future. If you are looking for a last man standing shooter that has seemingly endless replayability with constant updates and additions I couldn't recommend this game more.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

4/22/2017,0,0,83,TRUE,Recommended,Bought the game hour after it was released on steam and i was very excited!I started it up after a quick download and i noticed that the starting screen was a bit laggy but i wasn't worried yet because it was the first time running and there might be something loading in. The menu looks nice and i like that you make a group easy and edit your character.i checked the settings and it was on high for me (Not sure if that changes if you have beter specs that it would recommend ultra).First time playing! It was one laggy experience and i didn't really know what was happening so now i started to get a bit worried buildings wouldn't load and i could barely walk around but after a few minutes it would load the map a little bit more and it started to get a little bit better but still with huge framedrops.To be honest i wanted to return the game to steam because i was just unable to play not even thinking of competing with other players about life or death. I stopped playing and was just waiting to see if there would be an update/patch soon and it came! After the latest update they did not only make the game able to play for me without any form of freezing and framedrops but they also added new content now me and my friends can finally play the game (we have the same specs in our pc's).Now i am really excited to see where the game goes and how it will run after a few more updates the gameplay is really great and i love that they put it on unreal engine 4 it looks really nice and the fact that you get ''knocked out'' and if you don't get killed while you're in the downed state your friend might be able to pick you up ) you can still crawl around.After all i'm glad that i didn't return the game to steam and i will stay following and playing this game.Really nice job!Sven.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are a lot of things that need to be improved (smooth gameplay optimization servers etc.)I hope PUBG will not share the history of games that never came out of beta or alpha.

11/6/2017,0,0,351,TRUE,Recommended,"PLAYER UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUNDS or PUBG is a battle royale game which pits you against up to 100 players per game. Whilst there is great value and fun for a squad or duo of friend/s the game itself can become quite boring. The repeated feeling of looting for 30 minutes to realise you havnt seen any other players which is astonishing considering there is 100 players on the map turns into quickly realising youve been shot from players who are camping in the ""Blue Circle."" Rinse and Repeat. But hence that is the game. There isnt a better feeling in any game right now of when you find a kar98k fully deck it out Im talking 8x with bullet loops and silencer to be ""clickin heads"" all over the map. Every gun has its own feel which i personally think is the reason the cod games have died. It takes a certain amount of skill to get kills rather then bunny hop/strafe jumping and spraying off the hip to get a +15 (Promod cod4 can i get an amen).All in all the game is fun and is worth the purchase. Itll only continue to grow as the sales and concurrent players dosnt lie for statistics.3.5/5Needs new maps so its not the same over and over and over and more weapons to use at your disposal and ffs the amount of money its made the games is horrendously coded and i assume they are to busy porting the game to console to care about the master pc race anymore.Pick a place to loot Pick a place to loot Jump from plane Jump from planeLoot said area Loot said area bearley surving the onslaughtCircle is close just need a car Circle is the furthest point awayYay you found a car!

8/11/2017,1,3,232,TRUE,Recommended,This game is good cuz if ur friends are good then u can win but if ur friends are bad than dont play alot with them so u win more ok? good. first step to playing blayerpunknows gattlebrounds is that u have to win. the way to win is to make sure you are the last alive. to do this instead of killing other players u just hide and wait for it to be only u and another. Then you catch them by surprise and then u win. U have t0 loot houses so u can get good guns and meds and armor cuz if u dont then other ppl will get them and u will lose. The only good play is to win so loot and hide and win. u can kill others but its unecessary cuz u will probably get 8 kills but have bad friends so u lose cuz they all die and dont help you. i recommend buying Playerunknowns campgrounds because the shotgun is a 1 shot if ur close and that feels good so u should feel it too. also if u get a airdrop in the game u can get a sniper that 1 headshot ppl and u can win. there are clothes but they do nothing so theres no point in spending real money to get them but people sell stuff for 900$ so u can if u want. In conclusion this is a good game and im proud of everyone who wins. it is better than h1z1 king of the kill because h1z1 has unrealistic cars so u can jump without dying and that is stupid and bad. So buy this game and we can be happy thnx win pls.UPDATE i hav put more hours into the game and won more times so i have more advice for the people who struggle. TIP 1 If u lose to others wen fighting just let other people kill them frst tht way u can have advantage on weakened other people and loot evryoneTIP 2 buy some gud players on ebay and use them to help u winTIP 3 get better at hid nd seakTIP 4 Just play alot nd youll do fineIf you liked this review punch that like button in the face LIKE A BOSSS!!!

3/26/2017,0,0,360,TRUE,Recommended,The game is great if you can get over the few glitches and bugs (which we all know is being worked on so I dont really find it to be an issue aside from some frame drops I haven't got anything too bad) the kills feel so rewarding in this game. Even getting 1 kill makes your time feel worth it because to build up to it is very exciting. Either camping a house and thinking every sound is a footstep or dropping in a main city trying to be the first to get a gun to kill looters the game is always a rush! The reward system is pretty great too use coins from in game to open crates with clothes and what not in them (all sellable as far as i've got) Well worth the money!

If you don't then the game won't be as fun and it will get boring a lot quicker but you can still play duos and fives.

This game is a solid game that forces you to learn quickly. It has a steep learning curve for beginners who have never played any sort of Battly Royale type game before. At first it is super frusterating since there are sooo many people who have many more hours into the game. But the key to this game is to practice. I Havent had any server lag issues as of yet. My complaints Bugs such as your parachute catching the side of a building oddly dropping a couple of feet and losing half of your health. Playing on a NA server and getting non english speaking squad mates . UPDATE 3/31/2018 While I'm currently 101 hours into PUBG and I still suck very much. What is happening? You do an update on something worthless and the you cant even access the lobby for hours. When you do your character is #unkown. STOP with the weapon skins emotes events.

I cut away my parachute hoping to hold the marvelous semi rifle in my hand. Suddenly my life flashed before my eyes as I soar past the roof after being teleported 30 seconds into the past without a parachute hitting the ground. I emit a pained moan yet I lost not health and I'm standing upright. Trying to move forward but I'm stuck. My chest hits the ground as I look down at my ankles broken in 15 places my healthbar flashing red. Atleast there is no beeping alarm sound for that I think. I move up to the door ever so slightly annoyed as two broken keyboard lie next to me on the ground. My hand reaches for the door. It doesnt open. use use use The door finally moves. It's in a quantum position. I can see inside yet I can't move inside. I'm flabbergasted gasping out ""schrödinger why have you failed me.."" under my breath. Like a usb I use the door two more times to ensure it's finally right despite there only being two options. I can finally enter looking around on the bottom floor. Suddenly I hear footsteps feeling like I'm in jurassic park I run to the gun infront of me. A revolver with 15 bullets. Amazing. I pick it up and start reloading only to see the ammo appearing in my pocket 5 seconds after I grabbed it. My revolver fits an incredible amount of 10 bullets before I decide to stop. The steps are really close and I'm almost positive he didn't hear my mariachi band of metal clanking bullets. Coming to think of it where did they come from? The revolver was empty and I didn't drop anything. A foot appears in the door my senses come back to the important part the danger the enemy. I can see his barrel and his foot in the doorway waiting for him to enter my line of sight more before I start shooting. He's unarmored! What a miracle I might just win this! I think to myself shooting him in the head. The bullet hits him right in the face as blood splatters from his leg. Suddenly he shoots back towards the stairs. Yes he's not even shooting at me! I think catching some pellets in my face. Barely alive at 10 hp after he shot at me without even looking at me which is quite rude to be honest I make my last resort to running back to the room I found my weapon in. The door is still open so I can finally leave. He wont be able to get me out there with just a shotgun! Running for the kitchen I make it as he only just enters the room shooting as I'm already behind the wall. I'm safe! Let's just get out of her Killed by ngrf4gt with Shotgun. Better luck next time.

Aside from the most recent patch I actually haven't seen any bugs that I can remember and the bugs introduced recently are already fixed.The community gets nearly everything it asks for. We managed to get the region lock introduced (Even though it took months of spamming it in the comments of every update) and the map selection was added back very quickly. Actually PUBG Corp. could stand to listen to us a little less and focus on their top priorities instead. As most of us know the constant spamming is most likely done by a very vocal minority rather than a full representation of their playerbase.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

9/21/2017,0,0,227,TRUE,Recommended,I had been avoiding this game like it was ebola but a friend convinced me to buy it and it is a really good game.You dont need to run it on a god tier PC and you dont have to play on very high quality. I play on low and the game is still good looking fun and enjoyable.There are some good sides and some bad sides The pistols are not great but they are meant to hold you over till you find a real gun so I get it. I know some people have had issues rendering buildings but recently they seem to be fixed. Parachuting long distances takes practice but if it did not then I think there would be a big problem. It's not that hard to get a Chicken Dinner you just need to play smart even if you are poor at aiming. It's over all a good game with good hitboxes and fair aim mechanics the devs have stated they will never implement spray patterns like CS GO. This means engagments do not always favor the guy with 1 000 hours in the game the one who knows ever spray pattern and can hit you while jumping backwards and smoking a joint since he practiced. It's not that hard to get good at the game and learn the usefull game sense mechanics that can help you win. As of late October and the majority of November the servers have been under a large amount of stress and a heavy load. I find that some times the servers are a bit laggy and other times they are fine.Bluehole did an amazing job with the game it keeps getting updated all the time and the devs plan on supporting the game after it is fully released out of early access later in 2017.Over all my experiance with it has been good I would rate it 9/10.

9/13/2017,0,0,638,TRUE,Recommended,One of my most played games and it's still in early acess. The concept is simple you jump out of a plane and chose which area of the map you want to parachute to. Once you hit the ground it's everyman and his dog for themselves. The aim is to survive as long as possible and become the last to survive or become the last team to survive. As the game progresses the map will spawn kill zones aka the blue zone being outside these zones will damage you.

I don't like the different weather conditions as they make the gaming experience and fps worse.

7/10/2017,0,0,23,TRUE,Recommended,"This is the first review I am writing ever. And I have been on Steam for 8 years. Anyway. This game is addictive and I do NOT even understand why. I honestly suck 4 times I have been in the Top 10 once I was no 2nd place usually I make it to the last third and get murdered from somewhere. And still this game has a certain genius feel.Why? You live for these moments in a game where you do the same you usually get from someone far superior. Like driving over someone with a UAZ how has really good equiment but can't manage to shoot you out from the car. Of camping on a balcony and wait until somone is in the adjacent room looks out of the window does not see you (but you can because of 3rd person) he turns and gets killed by you. Or you and some other poor guy drop in the same group of buildings you find a gun first and hunt him down.My amateur tips for beginners Ignore the crossbow. Seriously.Car physics are a recipy for desaster motorcycles in particular.But great for getting in the zone from a bad choosen spot. Motorcycles are fast and loose control even faster.Air drops are usually cleaned out by someone who gets there with a fast vehicle and the camps it to kill anyone silly enough to think one minute after it touches ground you might have a chance getting there first. Yeah right.Inhouse fights are usually won with the mirco Uzi the UMP or a double barred shotgun. Just dont miss the shotgun.While you aim down the scope or iron sight with the same button you sprint (usually shift) you hold your breath to aim better. In the heat of battle I usually forget.Grenades suck. they take long to draw aim and throw. maybe if you throw it in a room with a camper you can manage some worth.All in all a sick genius game where you are drawn back to without any rational reason. You try to win you die to someone superior BUT once I a while you smile.And yes this game gives out adrenaline like candy. I only played ""singleplayer"". Maybe someone will read this and invite me to a clan or unit to play duo or team. I suck and will go now to get killed. 5/7 Would buy again!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/25/2017,0,0,57,TRUE,Recommended,"It's pretty good.I'll recommend it because it's fun at times but other times it can be downright boring. There's heaps of potential here. The mechanics and concept are pretty simplistic in nature though they can be a little annoying to grasp and the game isn't very friendly for new players especially solo and I don't mean that as in the community isn't very friendly (I play solo with voice turned off so I wouldn't know) I mean the game itself isn't very friendly to newer players.While the mechanics are simple the learning curve is steap due to the the fact that you have to learn everything on the fly and since there's no ranking system no levels to earn or anything like that you find yourself in massive matches with players far more experienced than yourself. It's only a slight negative really but it does make it a bit of a chore to learn.One of the issues I have that is basically the only major issue from my point of view is the way the play area works. Every so often the game will reduce the play area this area keeps getting smaller and you have alimited amount of time to get yourself to that play area or you'll end up taking damage and if you're too far away that damage will eventually kill you. This in itself is a really awesome system I love the idea of such a large map that continues to funnel players in to smaller areas so the action is pushed in one direction BUT the annoying part is you don't know where the first play area is going to be located until a minute or so after you land.I personally think that the very first play area needs to be marked before you eject from the plane at the start of each round. I can't tell you how many times as a new player I have been caught of guard by a play area located ages away from my selected drop zone with no vehicle in sight leaving me to have to run toward it often being so far away that I die before I get there. They give you a beefy amount of time to make it there but sometimes you just get bad luck and all hope is lost before the game can even get going for you.When this happens it just sucks the fun out of it and turns from this really amazing battleground battle royale shooter to a sprinting through the woods type simulator that ultimately ends in your death because you're way too far away. If the first play area was marked on the map before you eject this would not be an issue and you'd be jumping straight in to the action from the word go rather than feel lost. Something that is the absoloute worst is being sniped. It happens quite frequently where you will spend 90% of your game traveling from one spot to another without encountering an enemy only to reach your destination and be picked off by a guy who was lucky enough to select the correct area from the start of the game and has been there getting set up he has his weapons his gear and he's all cosy just waiting for people to stroll in you've only just got there so you have no idea the guy even exists until he pops a shot at you and then it's all over and it feels like you just wasted your time.It's just not fun to run around for ten minutes and get taken out by somebody you can't even see and cane barely even hear their gun shot they are so far away.The game is something that could cater to a numerous amount of play styles but with the things mentioned above you're only real option is to hop in to the first major town the plane goes over so you're get at least some action.One thing I do love is that they have a first person perspective (FPP) only mode where all players have the first person viewpoint. I'm not a fan of third person multiplayer and while the option is there to use either third or first in a regular game you'd be at a HUGE disadvantage using first person as the enemy will be able to tilt their camera to look over walls and through doors while you won't be able so I'm glad they have a first person exclusive mode.The reward system isn't very rewarding. Basically the way it works is that you compete earn BP (The in game currency) and buy cosmetic loot crates with that BP though each time you pruchase a crate the amount goes up so if you can't do good consistantly then you end up having to play a ridiculous amount of rounds in order to buy one chance at one loot roll as each crate will only give you ONE consmetic item and the prices go up to around 7k for a crate to my knowledge which makes it near impossible for the casual crowd to earn these cosmetic goodies at an acceptable rate.On the one hand this is actually pretty genius as people are playing for the simple fact that they enjoy playing. It's not about rewards or having some stupid prestige rank or whatever people just jump in because they are genuinely enjoying the experience but at the same time if you are going to offer up some form of reward then it should be at a level where each player regardless of skill level can earn the rewards consistently. Obviously those of a higher skill will earn these rewards much quicker as it stands now the 'reward' system clearly favours the hardcore and dedicated rather than the people who just want to jump in for a bit of fun from time to time.You can of course part with your real money and purchase these items off of the steam market place but have you seen the prices for these cosmetic items? They are insane.I can reccomend it but just know that it's going to take you a while to get in to it properly and you have to learn absoloutely everything while in the thick of it.While I do enjoy the game I do not agree with the practices of the developers in how they stroke the shafts and ego's of those popular streamers who chose to stream their game. I don't watch these streamers but banning people because they killed a streamer whether it be stream sniping or not is just disguting banning people for ""Harrassment"" because they honked their horn a few times near a streamer is also disgusting giving streamers exclusive rights to create their own custom games is disgusting. The devopers care more about the people who stream this game and those who watch those streams than they do the average player.Also Microtransactions in early access after you've sold one million copies is ridiculous. I also heard (note 'heard' as in I'm not 100% sure if this is true) that when the game launches crates are no longer going to be free which with how they currently work I take that to mean that you will require keys to open all crates and much purchase these keys via real money. Again this is a disgusting practice. You have sold over ten million copies of a $30 game and charge $2.50 per key to open unique crates which even if only a small percentage is buying them you are making a lot on just those keys alone yet you are going to make people spend even more money?",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

1/5/2018,1,3,1811,FALSE,Recommended,Best game I ve played in years for originality. I know battlerounds isn t the first game to use the battle royale formula but it seems I chose the best executor of the concept. When I first bought battlegrounds I had no expectations. I had around 1 600 hours in CS GO and wanted to play an open world survival game. I read that battlegrounds was more of a shooter than a survival game which at the time wasn t what I wanted. I watched a few videos and read a few reviews detailing the mechanics of the game and thought eh this sounds fun and novel enough to spend $30 on. 600 hours later and I m finally playing my other games (I stopped playing Witcher 3 Divinity Original Sin 2 Prey CSGO). I will probably never play CSGO again as Valve doesn t take care of their hacker problem and I played CSGO since the original game s beta which I installed from a PC Gamer disc sometime around 2000. With Bluehole enforcing a 1.5 million player ban for cheating since PC 1.0 I m hopeful that they will manage their community better than valve ever did. For the most part I find the community in PUBG to be okay. As a comparison CSGO was filled with racism sexism xenophobia and bigotry. It wasn t uncommon for people with white supremacist names to be spewing bigotry. I ve had to team up with a fair number of bigoted players in PUBG but they are easier to deal with because if I don t want to play a match with someone I can back out without a penalty. Also a nazi thrives on stupid people supporting their t inflammatory statements so when they don t have someone backing everything they say and actually have to use reason to argue their argument falls apart. Or you can just make fun of them for being a nazi the choice is yours. As far as trolling goes I ve encountered that only in random squads. Every so often you end up hitting a squad that has two really intentionally annoying players or someone who wants to drive everyone into another squad to be killed. Duos people are pretty cooperative because it s a little awkward to be an aggro when it s just you and your teammate and nobody else to witness the LOLs. I ve met a few solid steam friends through duos.As far as looting goes the game is pretty shallow here. There is no crafting. It s a matter of figuring out which guns work for you finding them and finding your preferred mods. I ve won games with very little loot and I ve lost games level 3d out with suppressors on my AR and sniper rifles. But looting isn t what the game is about really it s about teamwork and working with the terrain to gain an advantage over your enemies. Enemies on the hill behing a house getting shot at by guys you don t see inside of the house? Run up during the firefight and clear the house or wait in ambush for the team to loot the bodies. One thing you learn quick is to not engage everyone you see. You re here to survive not get kills. Let your enemies do the work of killing for you as you have no stake in which team lives and dies in a skirmish. And wounded players are a few bullets less you have to waste.While you may develop favorite places to drop and find yourself in a regular loot cycle where the circles force you to move is what keeps the game dynamic. You may start at the same place in two back to back games but be forced to move in opposite directions for each. When the circle gets small tactical decisions like should we take the house at the center of the circle or the hill at the edge? Become a matter of critical importance. Goddamn it we should ve gone dead center to the house while we had the chance is a pretty commonly used phrase that I cap a failed game with.Gun mechanics there are more realistic weapon ballistics than instaclick games like CSGO (sorry to make the comparison it s just the shooter I have the most experienc with). Understanding bullet velocity/drop and weapon mobility are all important. What you click isn t always what you get. This makes the game more challenging in my opinion and I like it. I m annoyed that maximum foliage isn t a mandatory thing as the game would be so much more interesting if you could hide in the grass. Most players turn it to its mimimum value so hiding in the grass is useless until the final circles.Vaulting can be clunky. I ve vaulted off a 3 story building when I was just trying to jump onto a ledge and landed right down between two enemies I was trying to get the drop on (but not like that) a few times and needless to say that s incredibly frustrating. Anyway go buy the game. If you haven t tried it by the end of 2018 what kind of gamer are you even sweetie?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Drop start looting be happy with good loot or complain about the amount of random stuff you don't need but you still keep finding them die without being able to fight back. Feel the satisfaction from that. Repeat. For hours. Mostly tho an interesting running simulator when safe zone decides to ruin your happiness and it's on the other side of the map...and of course on those moments no vehicles nearby. And yet the game is good. Or maybe I'm the one who has gone insane.Finding a chicken dinner after hunting for hours and hours makes everything totally worth it.

You could possibly add some tense music combined with the amazing sounds that this game can provide. On the other hand it is a game full of bugs glitches and a bad ban system.Moreover replay option should be added so that if we doubt that someone killed us by cheating we could instantly report him and help the developers understand those types of hacks.Furthermore some of the players are really offensive. I dont really like to mute when i play squad because there are people who really enjoy the game and they want to cooperate in order to win. All things considered even though this game is in early access it is really promising and i definitely recommend you to try it! Take some friends and enjoy exploring this huge and extraordinary map.

6/24/2017,0,0,211,TRUE,Recommended,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a really fun game to play with friends. I is quite buggy but the overall experience is still fun. The thrill of making it into the top ten by youself or with your friends is exillerating. My least favorite part of the game is how long it takes for the matches to progress. Overall it is a good time but does get rather repetitive 8/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
3/24/2017,0,0,178,TRUE,Recommended,"I usually don't review games anymore so stick with me...There are a few aspects of this game that seperate it from the rest of its genre. Its NOT just another survival of the finest the game presents itself with dignity and a fine polish for its early access. NOTE We should all be aware by this point in time of how early access games work when it comes to getting the game set up and running fluidly. I have spent the last 11 years on steam most of my life at this point playing competative shooters. I have played nearly every FPS i could get my hands on from CS series Battlefield Quake Halo TF Americas army The Specialist COD and countless F2P titles. Before I get into talking about the game I have to warn you... The skinny jeens for combat pants is a bit strange to me but with an open mind I continue on!Beside the before mentioned issue I have to be honest with you. This is by far the most enjoyable take on the Last Man Standing genre or ""Battle Royal"". PU BattleGrounds allows for a fair fight starting right out of the gate all 100 players for the match are hauled in on hulking plane. Once you reach land you are free to jump when you see fit. This allows players to instantly go for the spots they enjoy the most. I was never a fan of randomly falling from the sky with little control or awareness of where i was going anyways... The overal gun play is what I have found to be the most enjoyable. Realistic balistics! Bullets drop with time and distance guns must be sighted in for longer shots and you MUST AIM if you wish to not be taken by suprise and controlled my your enemy.The action is heart pumping the sounds are clear and everyone has a fair chance at winning the match.Cosmetics I think PUBG has truly mastered the art of Cosmetics. The clothing options are plenty for a game of this design. We arnt talking about CSGO style crate drops that other games have taken to with a micro market that ruins the economy for the game. For every match you play you are awarded a varied amount of points that go to opening a cosmetic crate completely free and easy to obtain your first few crates will. However finding clothes while running around is easy enough and by the 5th minute of gameplay you should already be clothed and ready for battle!Armor You are allowed ONE helmet Body armor and backpack! In other titles in the genre you would be able to hoard these and use them to replace your hurts. In this case you are only able to have one at a time and you must decided which to take. This makes the overall combat feel much more realistic if you rush into combat you will die... Take it slow and choose your battles!Cars Beware of this you cant jump out of the car at Mock5 and expect to survive! I have seen countless people die due to this and i feel it is completely needed. There was nothing worse then when a player could jump out of the car and shotgun your face off in just a few moments without taking a single bit of damage from the tuck and roll.DO NOT JUMP FROM YOUR CAR! slow down and park behind a tree or something people.Attachments Guns can have countless attachments on them from sight changes and forgrips cheek pads for sniper rifles. Your playstle is your own!Overall I am a HUGE fan for PUBG I have yet to experiance something that I felt altered the Fairplay rules. The community is of course filled with the same class of folk that played all the others. Hateful screaming children with nothing better to do then degrade others.. The community sucks but not at the fault of the game itself... Its the internet boys what else should be expect?If you read this and decide that its the game for you hit me up and we can duo!

10/24/2017,0,0,847,TRUE,Recommended,PUBG is very promising in that the game itself with its concept/art style/design/gunplay is great. But the server issues bugs and overall optimization are creating a rift between the playerbase and the developers. Bluehole has undoubtedly put together a great battle royale but only in the rough draft form so to speak. They need to focus on polishing what they have instead of creating more roadblocks in front of them (adding new maps guns vehicles clothing). When they create more content while the game is still buggy and laggy they give the perception that they dont care about the overall performance of the game. People have been rating this game negatively because they are impatient with this poor performance and want to fully enjoy this game! Bluehole is not a AAA studio but the time is ticking for PUBG as they have had a large sum of time and resources to get this game to a steady level of performance. If they cant deliver on optimization and server issues the big AAA studios will release their own battle royale crushing this game to where it will be forgotten.

8/15/2017,0,0,938,TRUE,Recommended,I haven't played that much yet but here's a review for if you're deciding to buy it or not.Upsides Hours of fun gameplay either solo or with squad/duo (Automatch possible). Big map lots of places to find loot and enough places to hide. Not a lot of microtransactions they're only for clothes right now lol. Fairly simple keybinds for gameplay and vehicles (cars motorcycles) Instant matchmaking. Very fun to play with friends. Rewards in crates which you can sell on the market (Currently for about 1$)Downsides Movement/climing can be confusing. Graphic issues such as buildings not rendering I have to turn textures to ultra and the rest to low in order for stuff to render before I land. (60fps overall) Optimization isn't great. Seems boring at first takes time to get used to. You will die a lot. Apperently Developers are banning for exploits and stream sniping which is unfair for an early access game. Looting takes most of the time. Hit Detection isn't perfect.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also this game gives you good thrills at the end of the match. What else is good about it is that everyone is competetive no matter what they do everyone wants that chicken dinner once in a while kek. Developers keep updating this game and ain't leaving it unstable. If you're fan of games like H1Z1 or some other survival/shooter of this kind you should definitely buy without thinking you wont be disapointed. I dont feel like I spended those 30$ on nothing. It's definitely worth its price. So go grab it and enjoy.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There is no way to prove this or not so any butthurt streamer can report you and get you banned for just killing them in game sometimes the devs ban you without even checking the proof or anything.you can also get banned for ""Harrasment"" which is understandable you should be banned or harrasing someone on mic but apparently some people have been banned for honking the horn of a vehicle repeatedly at someone. Which is just absurd.So basically the reporting system is just terrible some butturt online can get you banned because you beat them in game. So if you feel like being an stream on twitch get killed in game and get someone banned who probably doesn't even know you're streaming.Stream sniping doesn't even make sense. at all.

With plenty of tactics and styles to play the game gameplay remains refreshing. This game gives a rush of Adrenaline that no other shooter has given me specifically when near the end in a position where you might win that delicious chicken dinner. A lot of people have been giving this game bad rep recently since they release a box that gives cosmetics that you need to spend $2.50 on to unlock and receive the item inside but a portion of the proceeds go to charities and the Gamescom prize pool. So as much as everyone is upset with it please look past their angry reviews and buy this wonderful game that is only 29.99$ God Bless hehexd,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PubG got many bugs and performance issues but these can be easily ignored because of the fun you have while playing with friends. The most annoying issue is the rubberbanding probably a server issue and the only way to fix it is to wait for updates (they are on it).People with performance issues like low FPS or FPS spikes should set the graphic settings to (very) low and test things out till it works with the built in setup. I am playing this game with medium settings except shadow (very low).With 29 99 and a couple of friends you can have very much and very long fun with this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/4/2017,0,0,254,TRUE,Recommended,"PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS though still in early access has been a wonderful and amazing gaming experience for me personally. I am aware that not all others feel this way but this is my personal opinion. There is never an uneventful moment in this game especially when you reach the top 10 and your heart is pumping faster than ever before. The adrenaline kicks in and you experience a true ""fight for your life"" feeling that is hardly ever seen anywhere else. Even though there are some bugs and glitches because the game is still fairly new this game is truly one to keep your eye on. Recently many people have been leaving negative reviews because of the addition of the crate and key system. They are angry because PLAYERUNKNOWN and the dev team promised ""no micro transactions until the game's full release."" The reason crates and keys were added was to serve as a ""test run"" for later additions. Additionally some of the revenue from the crates goes towards charity the Gamescon Invitational PUBG prize pool and supporting the devs themselves. Plus PLAYERUNKNOWN himself even gave a sincere apology to the community for doing this. Most people overlook the reasons that this system was implemented and only think about the micro transactions. If you actually realize why the dev team did this you would understand that they had to do this for many reasons. But enough about that. Looking at gameplay you definitely need a beefy computer to run this game well which is a downside but I can assure you that it is worth it for the beauty of the landscape alone. Indeed the environment in this game does look very realistic and nice if you can run the game at high settings. One thing that really makes this game stand out from others is the huge requirement of strategy. If you don't have a game plan and aren't paying close attention to everything you will be steamrolled by the other players early on in the match. If you plan ahead and move tactically you will succeed and make it further into the game. Like I mentioned earlier the feeling you get when in the top 10 or higher is something truly unique to battle royale games especially this one. Overall I would definitely recommend that you give this game a try even if you are a bit ""on the fence."" If you truly hate it just refund the game and be on your way. You must remember that this game is still in early access and the devs need time to flush out all of the problems. And with the monthly updates bringing new content and a new map coming in the future there is a lot to get excited for.

1/26/2018,0,0,16,FALSE,Recommended,This game is simple but will keep you coming back for more. I suggest you try it out for the following reasons (1) It is half the price of a AAA title and if you get hooked you will be pouring in hours into this.(2) You decide what success means for you. Don't expect to be #1 in every game with 99 other players trying to kill you. Most of the time the way you die is the entertaining part.(3) Don't expect spectacular graphics or Hollywood effects in the front end because I think the reason why this game is special is because of the back end its ability to maintain server performance with 100 players and to match make continuously without ridiculous waiting times.(4) There are replays so if you spot a hacker let PUBG know about it. It is in PUBG's best interest to ban the hackers forever. So far I haven't seen a hacker in the EU servers. Hopefully I never see one at all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/24/2018,1,4,108,FALSE,Recommended,I'm going to say this now. And i'm probably going to get plenty of hate. All of these negative reviews come from people who are either Too young for this game or prefer to be the majority and say PUBG is bad and prefer Fortnite. Fortnite doesnt have the same quality as PUBG. This does also play into the other reason which is that the younger kids like Fortnite because it is so much easier. PUBG was developed and made for Teens and adults. Fortnite was made for Teens then adapted for younger kids. So when you aplly the rules of PUBG which is meant for people who are harder to beat to a game meant for little children that don't have to much experience in gaming it gets easier.On a side note PUBG brings plenty of new content keeping the game fresh. On the other hand their balancing is questionable. Things like how the UMP9 is so buffed up it's pretty much an AR makes absolutely no sense! They do also need to add some more anti hacking measures. Overall I think you should buy it. Hopefully the Fix PUBG campaign really helps to better improve these problems and bring more content. Anyways I hope you found this helpful.

8/17/2017,0,0,282,TRUE,Recommended,Honestly PUBG is one of the best Battle Royale type of game. I've had my fair share of H1Z1 and Arma 3 Royale and even The Culling but this one is absouletly the one with the most promise. Although this game does indeed have bugs because it is on early access the gameplay makes up for it. This game requires some skill but in the end it all depends on the loot you pick up and the place where you choose to parachute from. They added a First Person only server and honestly that is the way it is mean't to be played of course you can play 3rd person if you want a more easier experience but the intesity that the 1st person server holds are way too much to be explained in this simple review. If you feel like this game is too much for solo then have a friend join you as this game supports up to 4 people in a squad or if you don't have any friends just join a doubles or squad match with some randoms and make some. I highly recommend you get this game before it's released and has the price increased.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/10/2017,0,0,162,TRUE,Recommended,"Ah.. One of the Greats of this years Early Access.&lt The Quick Answer&gt Q. Is the game fun?A. ABSOLUTELY! Bring friends to get the best experience though.Q2. Should I buy it immediately? A2. Mmm.. Sure but you ought be cautious and know what your getting into. Objectively looking at the game it is quite a mixed bag.&lt The Long Story&gt *NOTE this is my first ""battle royal esque"" game so my view point when I might refer to H1Z1 or DAYZ may not be completely accurate. However I have been following those games and watching gameplay for quite a while now so I should have a general idea.So as many have countlessly stated this game can be very entertaining and rewarding when it wants to be.Whether you are a team player or a lone wolf player there is something for everyone. But do take into account that having friends to play with will enhance the experience a lot. It can be hell to work with strangers in team matches. Random matching can often end up with strangers screaming in their microphones for the mistakes you or someone in your team made be it on purpose or not. Speaking of which there are people who don't have microphones. By that point coordinating a must in team matches will become impossible.Also by the very nature of the game it can get very aggressive in both gameplay and voice chat. You'll be often greeted with politically infuriating(sometimes hilarious) statements being thrown about. If you have seen any of the Asian Server gameplay ""China NO.1"" and ""Taiwan NO.1""(hilarious if your from neither) will be the first thing you'll hear. If you get easily offended by such things this game might not be for you.To strictly talk about the gameplay side I'd say PUBG is a middleground between H1Z1 and DAYZ. What I mean by this is that it doesn't take it self too seriously to the point it is rediculously realistic like DAYZ but at the same time is gritty enough that it doesn't feel too arcadey like H1Z1. Bullet ballistics are user friendly with a touch of reality enough to make you think twice before shooting a target hundreds of meters away with an UZI. Maps and vehicles are also well crafted and spaced that you have a feeling of open world but not overwhelmed at the same time. Weapons are in variety and most are well balanced boiling down to personal taste than the actual specs. Not claiming that there aren't some weapons you might want to switch out later but PUBG does leave a lot of room for strategy. So even if you don't have the best gun doesn't automatically mean you are screwed. Overall its a good mix which I think is one of the reasons people are gravitating towards PUBG.Now gameplay is one thing but being a great game is another. Like I mentioned PUBG is kind of a mixed bag. While the gameplay it self is great there are major issues with the game like optimization and server crashes. Optimization has been greatly improved over the days but there is still much to be desired. If you don't have the latest desktop packing some major computing power prepare to lower settings. Even on Highend PCs there can be stuttering from time to time. Not saying that it is completley game breaking but its something you might consdier if you like +60fps with all your games.Servers are something that worries me though. I get that the number of PUBG players are growing rapidly but this issue with servers going down and people not being able to play is happening very often. Its has been a problem since day one and we are still seeing it. Bluehole(the dev) is not a small company. They have the capital. They even have an mmo under their belt as well so its not even lack of experience. Why they won't expand to a server size more capable is beyond me.While I do recommend this game. Please be cautious and think through before buying because you never know what will happen with an Early Access game. The servers and optimization issues are likely being tolerated because it is still Early Access. However if the problems persist through full release a lot of player base may abandon the game. The devs won't care either because they already have your money and LOTS OF IT too...Now if your still convinced to buy it... GET IT. GET IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

Made by Brendan Greene. (BR Arma 2 Mod) Good looking &amp fresh graphics. (Unreal 4 Engine) Acceptable ingame balance so far. (e.g. weapon spawns) Good reward system. (Still in progress) Simple but effective weapon variety and customization. No random spawn you ""decide"" where to land on an massive 8x8 km island. Work hard against cheater. Battle Eye forum and algorithm demo search. Very good &amp smooth menu guidance. (Highlight matching parts) Early access game yes but core mechanics of the game are 99% solid. CONS For some people performance needs to improve. (But they are working on it) Movement animation looks sometimes bit strange. (Maybe because of lags?) Hitboxes sometimes doesn't fit. (Lags?) Some distance graphic bugs which can cause advantages. (e.g. shoot trough not loaded trees/stones) Sometimes the start of a match is unplayable laggy. Overall one of the best.

5/31/2017,0,0,498,TRUE,Recommended,It was kind of a risk adverse run. I dropped at the powerplant usually there's a few other people who drop there but there were no one there that time. I found some good loot and stuff including a SKS and level 3 body armor. I run from the powerplant to some area outside and locate a car. I sit and camp hidden in a bush close to the car to scout for other players until I have to move.I took the car up in a hillside a little deep in the circle and went to a close by rock for cover. This is where I see my first players in a town about 400m away. I don't take a shot because they are constantly moving. I wait here checking behind me a towards the town for other players when my car which I parked like 100m away from me is stolen. I don't get a clear shot on him but I have to move by foot for the next circle. I make it even after spending a significant time in the blue because this is only the 3rd one and you can outheal the damage if you time it right.At this point I get my first kill just inside the white. It's safe to assume he doesn't expect me because the circle has been active for a while. I pop him with a silenced pistol (just in case). The circle is closing in on a town area I try to make my way down there using tree cover. On my way I see someone hiding behind a bus down in the down I kill him with SKS headshot and go back into cover in case someone heard me. I see someone else running on my right towards the town I try to kill him but I just tag in hard before he gets to cover.I sit here for a while before I have to make it into the town. My path has no cover and I am certain there is someone on my right. So I off smoke my approach and on my way there I see him and I stop to take him out. At this point there are 4 players left my heart is pounding like crazy and my hands are sweating. This game can be properly intense. I am hugging a wall close to the leftmost edge of the circle when Feistyfrog takes out 2 people consecutively with the M24 sniper rifle leaving only me and him.I am certain he does not know exactly where I am and I knew roughly where he was. The play area is down to like one house and the surrounding backyard. Grenades were exchanged to no avail and he has to move because of the blue circle (which will deal a lot of dmg at this point.) He tosses a smoke in another direction to bait me (I assume) but I saw where it originated and I heard his steps. It ended in a head to head battle where we cat and moused out of cover a couple of times. I managed to come out ahead.So well a lot of patience some luck some positioning and some mind games. I didn't queue up again because I needed some time to decompress.I made it to 3 one time also but that time I was embarrassingly killed by the circle.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
4/1/2017,11,13,31,TRUE,Recommended,"This game has been very enjoyable however just recently (that is in my last game) I executed a perfect three point turn over a teammate I was paired up with basically this began after he insulted me personally by assuming that I was some sort of charitable taxi service demanding if he could ""come get in the car with me"". When I then responded ""being a teammate is not a sufficient payment and in order to get into my vehicle you must first perform oral sex on me."" I was then met with an uncouth verbal attack. This then escalated further into what can only be best described as a spontaneous form of slapstick comedy. ""VReady970"" began firing off several shots at the back of the vehicle in order to injure me and then subjugate myself under his control by his laughable attempt to dethrone me from driver's seat in the vehicle his telos (ultimate aim end goal and so on and so on) being so that he could drive off and abandon me to die. However in protest I then began gaining a momentous amount of speed proceeding to contact my car with ""VReady970"" until he was downed and then reversed over him dead. A catastrophic outcome for ""VReady970"" is also in part a valuable lesson in morality. The lesson being (although a depressing one) that he must perform oral sex the next time he wants to get into a vehicle without having anything to offer (in real life or alternative reality he must decide).Finally this game raises an important philosophical question that must be examined that being whether the player (the gamer the individual and so on) can handle such an intrinsic lesson in ontology which is delivered in such a naturalistic and almost primordial narrative so suddenly without any knowledge to the player beforehand.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

4/29/2017,0,0,85,TRUE,Recommended,"I don't usually write reviews for Early Access titles but this game has *a lot* of potential if the developers continue to make progress and don't abandon the title like most seem to do. I'll try and keep things short and sweet.Pros If you like DayZ's PvP then you'll enjoy this. It's essentially more of the same except without zombies. The map is reasonably sized so that although there will be periods you don't encounter anyone you're never really too far away from a threat. By extension of the above since you skydive from a plane and that plane is randomly positioned there's more variation in your starting experience. The mad rush to find weapons at the start especially if you land in a hotzone is thrilling. Weapon variety is good and are not too scarce with some of the more powerful weapons requiring effort to obtain. Vehicle variety is good and not too scarce. The playable radius of the map decreases over the time funneling people into a hotzone closer to the end of the round. Generally good performance. I can run on Ultra 60fps with a GTX 980 I5 4670k OC'd 4.2GHz. Sound and animations are pretty much spot on.Cons Although you shouldn't really expect it in this type of game don't expect players to be nice. If you've not found a weapon and some guy comes across you with an assault rifle you are dead. Similarly players are incredibly annoying over voice chat. Mute. By extension voice broadcast is ""On"" by default and can potentially give away your position. Numerous bugs crashes performance issues on occassion. To be expected with an Early Access game but worth mentioning nontheless. Hit detection is hit and miss sometimes all your shots will make contact sometimes not. Desync issues cause players not to take damage etc. Cheaters / hackers. Yes they exist. Anyone who tries to convince you otherwise is either a hacker themselves or ignorant to how multiplayer video games or computer systems actually work. Although the use of Unreal Engine 4 is good I find the graphics to be pretty lacklustre.Potential Improvements I would like to see more map varieties. I'm tired of ""Generic Island"" and miles of farm yards / forestland. Give us snow! I honestly think they should implement a seperate PvPvE mode where say wild animals are a threat and you have to eat/drink. More vehicle clothing and weapon variety but doubless these will come in time.Comparsions I haven't played H1Z1 but most people seem to be thinking it's better. This game is essentially what DayZ should have been without zombies and is already much better. The smaller map and lack of survival elements outside of PvP combat lend itself to a much tigher engaging experience. Bothemia Interactive REALLY dropped the ball with DayZ which is unfortunate though not suprisingly given how much of a money maker it was. If PUBG continues to get updated regularly and with plenty of content then it will stand the test of time.Verdict If you're on the fence especially with it being an Early Access title then I don't blame you. Although the game has had support since release such can be said about previous titles that have become incredibly popular only to die a death. For what my opinion is worth I am confident that this is a product worth investing in purely for the current experience alone.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

There are a number of issues still with it being in early access but I really hope that will be addressed most importantly the server performace the tick rates have to go up!

8/5/2017,0,0,667,TRUE,Recommended,So I've seen the reviews fo this game take a hit with the recent updates and wanted to give my two cents.Yes a crate system has been introduced but the items are purely cosmetic. Don't see why so many people are off by this since it has absouletly no effect on gameplay. It's purely optional like Dota2 or CS GO. Just because it's there doesnt mean you have to take part in it.The most recent monthly patch (August 2017) basically broke the servers to the point where the game was unplayable. However within around 36 hours a hotfix was released and since then the servers have been in the best shape the've ever been in. Been playing this game since it came into early access and within 4 months they've come a huge way. When i first started playing I was getting around 30fps the game was full of bugs and the servers were (granted I'm playing on a Laptop running a GTX 860).Now I'm getting a constant 60fps on butter smooth servers. and almost all of the game breaking bugs have been fixed to the point where I can play for days without encountering one.Don't get me wrong this game still has a ways to go before completion. There's still bugs and glitches that need ironing out new content that was promised and proper First person for all servers (only available in NA and EU solos and duos at the time of writing) but seeing the dedication of the dev team and their attention to the community I'm fully confident that this is gonna be a masterpeice of a game at full release even more so than it already is.Even in its current state this game is highly recommended. Duos or Squads are the best since theres nothing more fun than dicking around with a bunch of mates but solo can be incredibly fun and tense too and is the mode I've played the most probably cos I don't have alot of gaming friends (. Obviously can get frustrating when you have all the gear in the world and you get killed by a guy camping a bathroom with a micro uzi but thats part of the game.The very late stages of the game are the best bits. When you're in a town with fire fights going off all around you and you hear footsteps around the corner.

I believe they can change that.Shooting people The hitboxes are a mess as the shooting itself. Happens to have 4x scope 8x scope aiming to the head from a distance (ofcourse i changed the meters) and the bullet went very very off (You can learn that by playing more and more so you will get the mechanic but still they can make a change here). Map I think the map needs some improvement due to so many open places and sometimes you run and you pray noone is there to hit you and die. Also the campers are part of the game. I pray for that one time that the safe zone will close on top of me which never happened always had to move in safe zone and fighting with person were already in there cause the safe zone close in them without doing any move.One other thing that i would want to see it changing is when you are duo or squad if someone hits you and it's instant death you should die and not just knock out. And one last happens very often looting 5 houses and find absolutely nothing and get in one house and find 1 ak 1 kar supressors and full extends with healing I belive they need to do something with this i know it's kinda random but we all know where are the hot loots even if you have to battle for thisTLRDGame is nice needs alot of work yet before it gets released. I hope the developers fix everything i mentioned and i am sure many more i didn't wrote. Recommend since it's fun and addictive but as i said needs a lot of work.6/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/10/2017,0,0,207,TRUE,Recommended,"Honestly this game is amazing. It has such a tactical gameplay feel and the gun selection is great.I have 93 hours played in H1Z1 and I can honestly say this game is more fun to play. I wouldn't say it's any better or worse because it's totally different. In H1Z1 you can run around with a shotgun. If you try that in this game you'll get sniped from someone on a mountain 200m away with an 8x scope.And if anyone tells you that a beastly PC is required they're wrong. I have an Intel Core i5 processor and a GTX 750 and I run all settings very low (with the exception of textures those are on medium) and it runs a steady 45 50 fps which is perfectly playable for me.The only complaint I have is the servers. It seems as if the devs weren't expecting this game to be as popular as it is and the servers are always overloaded. You sometimes get a popup saying ""network lag"" and you can't move at all. This only happens rarely and if it does it lasts 10 seconds at most. So in summation this game is great and you should pick it up if you don't have it already.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But not when the game is poorly optimized contains too many bugs to count and it stays that way. They ignore everything wrong with the game add in new things that break the game a little bit more then expect to be praised like heroes. Nah I'm not with that. On the other hand the game is fun. Wether you're solo duo or in a squad there's always something fun about the game and that's why I spend a lot of time playing it. Just because a game is bad doesn't mean it's not fun.

11/14/2017,1,1,1012,TRUE,Recommended,So because I played so many hours of this damn addicting game i thought i should do a review. First of I have nearly 500 hours brought into this game so I know nearly every pro and contra. But there are many things where you can think with two mindsets and I cant look into the brains of other ones so sorry for that boys. I have to say this game is absolutely amazing to play and you really get into it after a while playing it. Its really skillbased but you can still have really much fun even as a beginner because there is so much to learn. the level of strategy needed by this game is quite high i d say and till yet it didnt get any boring. You just go into a round kill a few people or die win the round or lose but still you have fun and lust to do another round. Its a great thing for such a game that there is yet no ranked game mode because after a few months you would get tilted as to be completely honest. Also if you dont have a good computer yet you should just forget the game. Its kinda impossible to play it with a below average PC. Also there are many bugs in the game but I can tell by twitter that the team is really working on it. So i think i have to give this game a thumps up and really look really forward into the future of Playerunknowns Battlegrounds.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

11/26/2017,0,0,200,TRUE,Recommended,A great game if you have a couple friends to play it with. The concept's not new 100 person battle royale style gameplay however it has been done very well here providing some exciting shootouts and standoffs. On the downside the devs have seemed to move from caring about making a great game better and moving away from optimisation (which it needs a lot of) to money making with the new crate system. The recent reveal that they were planning to port to console was also quite upsetting as I feel the game isn't complete a) in terms of content and b) in terms of bugs and glitches.I really like this game and I would recommend getting it but I'm not going to be surprised if it turns out to be a flop in a couple of months.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
4/4/2017,0,0,1797,TRUE,Recommended,"04/04/17 120h ""Review"" If you want something with action to play with friends this is the game to do so. Been 2 weeks since launch and the game is going strongh. Optimization needs work but like I said game came out 2 weeks ago. I have a solid 60 120fps in houses/towns/middle of the field (can get low as 40fps in big towns but those need work) with a RX480 and i5 6400 4Ghz. Right now you can play solo duo squads of 4 people (you can play with only 3 and fill up with a random or just your group). It's not comparable to H1Z1 I mean sure it's battle royal but it's a totally diferent game and feels different aswell (DayZ feel to it). Early Acess have to say this is the best example of EA I've ever seen. The game is fairly polished and runs well ( on this I'd like to add that the game runs WELL for ME I also play with everything on LOW settings for a competitive end. A lot of people been complaining about performance but with the game being out for such a small time you can't really complain about that...or anything at all since its EA...and you were told that..) Bad stuff? I don't like to point the finger at anything given its a EA acess game sure optimization is ok but will improve circles need work servers are sometimes but well this game its the 3rd most played game on steam right now so its stressing the server game feels arcadish?

If they are not 100% try to replace them. You want all your equipment and health at 100% in the final circles. Air drops are a gamble. Use your instincts on whether or not to go for it.

9/30/2017,0,0,379,TRUE,Recommended,25.06.2018 I have to admit I've been losing touch with this game for a few months. It has not been enjoyable and the content was stale. This new update has changed things for me. The QBZ is an incredibly fun weapon. It feels right the damage is great and the spawn rate is fantastically high. The upsetting part for me is that I know it will soon be nerfed...The new map is what dragged me back into the game. Since the update I have played hours upon hours of it just for the new map. There are however some issues to be addressed.1. The lack of map selection on the old battle royale series is not a good idea. Why are we calling it mini royale and battle royale? What's wrong with just selecting a map?2. When you have just exited a game and you immediately click ready up your character does not ready up you don't find a game but the ready up icon is greyed out and unselectable. This can usually be fixed by restarting lobby but on occasion I have had to restart the game.3. The loading screen time has been significantly increased. When I'm loading into a game sometimes I can hear myself running on the dirt after parachuting and I'm still not loaded in.I hope these issues can be fixed soon. Thanks for making the game good again. An early access supporter.OLD REVIEW So This game of yours that I paid a good portion of 30 for really does not work...It is a great idea and a great game however you need to FIX THE DAMN THING.This is literally the defenition of AIDS Half the time you can't connect to servers The lag is actually unreal Loading errors left right and center Made hundreds of millions of dollars still can't fix the 'servers too busy' thingHeres a suggestion Put the extortionate amount of money that you made from an unfinished pile of wank to good use and FIX THE GAME PLEASE!If the game doesn't work why on Earth release it?,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But the game play is very enjoyable. The game is not worth 30$ as of right now but with time and further updates I'm sure this can be a very successful game. Its best played with friends so you can communicate among yourselves. And if you don't like games that have slow points you will not enjoy this.

5/10/2017,0,0,75,TRUE,Recommended,This game is exhilarating! I've played just about 10 hours so far and already the number of times I've felt my heart pounding in my chest or gone giddy with excitement or jumped in my chair from surprise are beyond counting.To address the elephant in the room it doesn't run very well (I get about 20 25 fps on the lowest settings with a basic laptop and good internet) but I'm surprised to say it hasn't put me off perhaps a testament to how good the gameplay actually is.Battlegrounds is addicting exciting and always fresh but from what it sounds like the poor framerate issues are universal (even on high end computers) and will be hard to fix my impression is that the devs are indeed working tirelessly on it but the improvements are still a long time coming.If sub par performance is a deal breaker for you maybe this isn't your game... Yet. It's still in early access as of this review so it can only get better. I would still recommend it for those seeking exhilarating gameplay but with the above reservation that it won't run as well or look as pretty as other contemporary games of the same ilk.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It's just clothing chill lmao (also side side note I unboxed my coat from a FREE CASE))Reasons why I like this game It's quite a lot of fun (when it's not lagging please optimize) It's quite a lot of fun with friends (when it's not lagging please optimize) This game is fun to troll in and just mess around in (please don't add ranks that will ruin the fun)Reasons why I don't like this game Unoptimized (please optimize) Network lag (always in the worst spots too) Unoptimized (please just ing optimize)Other than that this game is fun.

10/26/2017,0,0,486,TRUE,Recommended,Let me start by saying i really enjoy playing this game. PUBG is a blast to play espcially with friends. However there are several things that absolutely ruin the game. First off the game is still poorly optimized. I know i dont have a top end PC but i have no issues running any games but this. 3 out of 4 games i have to wait about 10 25 seconds prior to looting due to buildings not rendering. Also the game is filled with hackers. Hopefully the creators are doing things to fix these issues. All in all it is a fun game and i enjoy playing it but buyers beware. Until changes happen you will be dissapointed probably half of the time while playing this game.Update to my review My game has been running much smoother now with all of the updates the game has been adding. Hackers are still a thing but i feel like the creators are doing a good job of banning them. I strongly recommend this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

4/29/2017,0,0,22,TRUE,Recommended,This is definitely a solid game it handles like a triple a one but its not. Battleground's i think personally is best played with friends from my expirience. The only negative thing i have to say for the game is that it still lacks in variety of equipable items. For example it doesn't have a lot of weapon variety or another example would be the buildings across the whole map they're just the same buildings with the same furniture inside them and sometimes even the same items. Other than that a very solid game for what it is right now. Would definitely recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

7/25/2017,0,0,43,TRUE,Recommended,I can say without a doubt that PUBG is one of the most fun games I have ever played by myself and with friends. Even though I don't have many hours on record to write a full review this is what I can say for the game so far. (Side note as of writing this review I have 10 hours on record). This game gives you adrenaline very quickly. One moment you can be running in a field not thinking there is anyone near you and the next moment you can be getting shot at trying to hide or locate the enemy. Very few games have given me this feeling of anticipation and making my heart race and I am so glad to have purchased this game. I was a little on the fence since it is an early access game and the price was 30 dollars but I said screw it and bought the game. I don't regret buying the game for a second. When I play with friends and when we find a four seat vehicle we like to shoot at enemy cars Mad Max style. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun time with friends and for a jolt of adrenaline.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

3/23/2017,0,0,239,TRUE,Recommended,In comparison to H1Z1 this game focuses much more on the realistic gunplay and loot you can find throughout the map. If you are coming from H1Z1 don't be suprised that it is much less arcade y and a much slower paced game. Cars are less rare however there is more weapon choice clothing attachments and so forth. Minimal bugs and missing features make the game slightly annoying to play. Not sure if the game should be worth $30 dollars however IMO I should have waited to purchase the game and let it develop and patch from the player feedback due to inital launch. Wait a few months or so before purchasing if you are having doubts of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

6/3/2017,0,0,272,TRUE,Recommended,"Let me preface this by saying that I am absolute trash a this game. Like I must be the worst PUBG player ever. Of all time. That said.... I absolutely ing love this game.Okay sure it's got a LOT of issues. Some are small such as the schizophrenic gun mechanics and utterly sadistic incarnation of RNJesus that dominates this game's world as its overlord. Some are not so small such as HORRIFYING optimization and wonky mechanics. But you know what? I'm not going to about those things as this is early access. For an early access game this thing plays and looks damn good. Add that to an awesome dev team and a stellar community and things look peachy.But that's not what I love about this game. What I love is the gameplay itself. When I first got the game I was down with a three week case of pneumonia and I felt like And so getting rekt in an unfamiliar game with mechanics I wasn't used to and a choppy framerate (It runs exponentially better on my machine with recent updates by the way) I'll admit to getting a bit salty and thinking ""This game is crap."" But as I got better both health wise and gameplay wise I began to like it. What really clinched it for me though was my first kill. Dropped out in Gatka with a buddy one other team with us. I'm looting a building and this dude comes around the corner with an M16. It was a split second of electricity I clicked my mouse and heard the gloriously realistic sound of my looted shotgun going off and watched my would be killer drop to the ground in a lifeless heap. And once I had the taste of blood the game took on a whole new light for me. I began to enjoy the ferocious firefights the tense sniper duels and the terror of running through the open. I fell head over heels for this game and while I still suck at it I HIGHLY recommend it.Now if you'll excuse me I'm gonna go get rekt some more xD",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I liked The Culling for a while but that game has gone to I have played the Arma 3 Battlegrounds and that was fun but arma runs like aids(even on my i5 6600k and 1070 combo)and it has lost some of its popularity lately making it hard to find a match thanks to PUBG. If you are worred about this being an early access title you're not alone I am in the sinking Dayz Standalone ship made by the slowest devs in the world but the PUBG devs seem to inspire confidence and have been working hard with well timed updates and do a good job at keeping the community informed with what is going on behind the curtain. This is not the most or the worst optimized game in the world but check your specs to make sure you can get something like 60 FPS or better if not you will be at a disadvantage in firefights and that might get frustrating. But if you can run the game at a playable frame rate IT IS A BLAST especially with your friends. This is one of the only games that will get my heart racing and actally immerse me in the game.

5/27/2017,0,0,421,FALSE,Recommended,Good game but still not a finished game. 30 is a price where about 10 are for future development I suppose. Developer listens to community and fixes bugs or makes wishes of the community come true (e.g. last 2 zones are now slower).I would add more weapons or new maps but the gameplay on its own if fantastic every round. Note this game requires more GPU than CPU.***Update 1.0***The new map Miramar is pretty good at all. Vaulting is a long awaited feature but does not affect the game as much as I supposed because on the old map you cannot get on any roof. You have to keep in mind that Erangel is not based on vaulting and Miramar indeed is. Rubberbanding is still a problem tho which could be easily fixed in my opinion. I hope the focus of the devs will be at improving the performance of PUBG rather than beginning with micro transactions or too many cosmetic items.All in all a pretty good game to play alone or with your friends!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The first game my friend and I won we shouted and immediately ran around outside. The gunplay is intense strategy is critical and something as simple as good positioning are very imprtant in this game. People who value teamwork and communication are rewarded here.As you may hear the game can crash fairly often and has some moments of network lag. This can be frustrating and has sometimes resulted in the loss of 20 minutes of build up and preparation. However most of the time I have been able to relaunch the game and join back in after crashing in a minute or less. This game can be a lot of fun but it's always better with friends or with a squad that communicates in your language and has a good attitude. I haven't regretted my purchase.

7/28/2017,0,0,484,TRUE,Recommended,I don't write reviews. Ever. However reading some of the reviews on here they are all aimed towards the microtransactions system. They are negatively rating the game over cosmetics. They do not enhance gameplay. I will still continue to play this game after microtransactions get introduced. The game is poorly optimised yes I will agree. However the core gameplay and experience is amazing. This game is enjoyable every match. So unless you feel the need to buy a new shirt for your character or something (Which in game will be covered by body armour and helm anyway) then I would HIGHLY recommend this game.EDIT Now all of the reviews are based on hackers. I don't have the most time played but I often hit high in the leaderboards I do not see as many hackers as the others are. In fact very rarely will I find one.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The fact that the PLAYERUNKNOWN ""lied"" (which is highly debatable because it is not likely that he mad the decision by himself) should NOT be relevant to an actual review of the GAME!So... get your collective heads out of your collective behinds stop whining about the trivial and quit the drama.The game is awesome and is going become more so every day.This is what counts.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/7/2017,0,0,41,TRUE,Recommended,This game is great fun with friends. Luckily I had some good friends who have already been playing the game for a nice enough length of time that they helped carry me a bit for the first few games however despite only putting in 3 hours into this game at the time of writing this review I can certaintly say that I will definitely be investing more time into the game in the future!Let's just hope they keep on top of the updates brining the best experience possible. High Hopes! SlothfulEdit 1 Not really much has improved in the game from what I can see it's still badly optimized and laggy with the tendency to sometimes get your charcter stuck in weird places and the bullets not always hitting your targets like you think they are! It's a fun game to play from time to time but other than that until they fix the bugs and make the performance a lot smoother I think I'm going to keep this review a negative!Edit 2 They have added added some better stability improvment updates now and the game actually runs relativley smooth the hit registration seems to be a bit better now too but I could just be imagining that the only thing I really have a complaint about is the lack of new content considering how much they made and how well they have done surely a new map or even just a bigger variety of weapons would suffice? Then again I know it's easier said than done! But for now it's back to a positive review here's to more updates!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The fresh start every game is what makes me love the game intense survival game that you hate one minute and you're eating chicken dinners the next. With that said it still has many issues but they have been keeping on top of making sure they deliver what the community is asking you. Just wish they would fix the other dumb bugs in the game and leave everything else that was good before (the UI) alone. Either way I play nightly and enjoy every minute spent looting houses and running through the woods. Can't wait for the next update to drop the new map weapons and cars!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

3/31/2017,0,0,95,TRUE,Recommended,"Temporary Review. I have a serious client crash issue with this game. That said I really enjoy it and have faith that this problem will be fixed.Pro's Arma inspired controls map gameplay. Team play option up to 4 players. Great tension as the game comes towards a finish.Con's Memory crashes upon opening inventory (this is a serious one. 1/3 of all my games I crash to this) while sound quality is good the directional sound is poor. It sounds very mono when hearing shots/cars ect.Summary I'm not a fan of the ""battle royale"" genre but this one has just the right amount of arma injected to grab my interest. After getting to grips with it I soon realized it had a solid engine good optimization and heart pounding gameplay. It took me back to the days of wasteland and dayz mod for arma 2. If you're an arma fan pick this up you won't regret it. The reason this is a temp review though is that I have a game breaking crash when opening my inventory. It's apparently a known bug and in the pipeline to be fixed though it has been the cause of a few mini rage fits when in the final 10 players and sitting on great gear with 6/7 kills under my belt I loot a guy for the ghillie suit he's wearing and crash to desktop ( All in all it's early access so if you can withstand some annoying bugs go ahead and pick this one up.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

10/11/2017,0,0,285,TRUE,Recommended,The game is a lot of fun but in my opinion it is in dire need of some optimization as the framerate is extremely variable.Also I recommend playing PUBG with friends as it is loads more fun than playing it alone.The guns are pretty all right and the different attachements make some of the weapons really versatile as long as you are lucky enough to get the parts you need. Sometimes though you'll be running around with a red dot scope on your sniper rifle for an extensive period of time before you find something better but obviously this is bound to happen with randomized loot.The vehicles are in my opinion usable but not something I enjoy using. The vehicles can sometimes feel difficult to maneuver (especially when being shot at) but this might be because of the game engine. Regardless I think there is potential for improvement in this area. All in all the game is a good buy and you are bound to have a lot of fun. However sometimes the game can be really infuriating but this might break down to the loot being randomized or your skills being limited. Whenever an optimization patch comes out I'll praise the developers. For the time being though I would not recommend anyone to play the game if they have worse specs than a GTX 970 or R9 280X paired with a CPU with the least possible bottleneck /b as the framerate can be infuriating and especially in tense situations. Shootouts in 40fps is not very satisfying I'll tell you that much.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/24/2017,0,0,64,TRUE,Recommended,Game is amazingly fun and I rarely have friends to play with.Have had literally no problems with optimization or poor fps despite all the complaints I've been reading in reviews here and my PC isn't amazing by any means. As for the microtransactions got some sweet looking items from 'em already and can sell extras for a nice profit($2.50 crate sell jacket drop for 7$). Literally don't buy them if you don't enjoy them its not breaking your game plenty of content and fixes are being pushed out regularly alongside the MTX items. One thing I would like to see is more map diversity which they are working on if the upcoming desert map is anything to go by.There was also some crap about stream sniping and people being banned for stupid reasons(Like honking car horns) but I haven't experienced anything like it myself. Pretty sad if thats the case but just have to be careful.All in all awesome game. Even better if you have friends to play duo or squad with sometimes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

6/8/2017,0,0,77,TRUE,Recommended,Essentially the game is a great game Its so good and I'd give it a 8/10Gameplay Gameplay is great the shooting mechanics are great the animations blend in well when running and I love it.Sound The sounds of gun fights turn it into fun fights (get it Fun Fights lmfao) I love the gun fight sounds as you can hear enemies from a while away but at the same time is realistic.Graphics Graphics are average (Then again I play on the lowest graphics.) Optimization is really bad atm so if you have a computer don't buy it until you get a better computerPlayerbase Player base is interesting actually Its very diverse with spastics and actual tryhards all and all everyone has the same objective so you don't have to care about being shot unfairly/toxically unless you're on a Squad or Duo which has never happened to me.Guns and Customization The game has a lot of guns that make it systematically good. You can also modify the guns which changes the dynamic of the game A LOT. I love games that allow for customization.Character Customization I love how it works You don't need microtransactions to get better clothes you NEED actually play the game that makes me happy because it rewards players who actually play the game Love it.Plot There is no plot just a plot of massive land P.Map Map is interesting I enjoy exploring the map biggest problem is that it caters to players who've been playing the game for a long time so they know better spots for loot.Car Driving It operates similar to H1Z1 King of the Kill in such a way possibly due to it sharing a SIMILAR developer playerunknown kun sama chanArt Art is alright very plain and boring but the gameplay makes it up.User Interface The User Interface is VERY PLAIN and boring and it a problem for me in such a way because it is not convient I don't want to learn tricks with the UI in the battlefield For example looting when healing etc.Realism Realism is not what you play this game for even though the art of the game has drab colors.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

9/13/2018,0,0,110,FALSE,Recommended,Love the game! But it takes to long time in the lobby as well as in mid game to actually get in the game u know? It takes 20 min of looting to so get in a tiny bit of action that might just end in 2sec becouse u die. So basicilly what am trying to say is that it takes to long before things happen as in games like fortnite it takes max 30sec in lobby rare more then 15 sec. Then there is action almost all the time. thats why I play fortnite more then pubg. Becouse I get more out of the time playing fortnite. Have a lot of friends that agree with me as well. They also play fortnite more becouse of that exept one guy who went back to Leauge of Legends. And the game is insanely big and takes a lot of space My wifi and computer is fine so dont really care. But most poeple who play the game dont have 280mb per second download speed. So should try to make the updates as small as possible ) But exept from those small things the game is great!

I don't know why this game has so many negitive reviews. Also if anyone ever tells you that Fornite is better than PUBG they probably wear a skirt I'll just throw that out there. It all started with H1Z1 and this was really big when it was released and took KOK's fan base. This game was the second biggest battle royale game released but then overtook H1Z1 and became number 1 on the charts. It's really fun and action packed. It also takes some amount of skill. Now even though i don't agree with some things the devs have done with this game It still doesn't take away from the fact that this is a good game. One of the biggest problems with this game more so in the past is the hackers. This games playerbase kind of died out and maybe that's why there's not as many hackers but it used to be very bad.

I havent run into a single hacker in the last 12 hours of solid play. I have run into any bugs. The game is unforgiving when it comes to death and peoples' playstyles (sh*t tactics etc.) But nonetheless the game was worth more than $30 to me Ive spent way more on much sh*ttier games.

10/26/2017,0,0,195,FALSE,Recommended,It's a great game and IMO the best battle royal game out there I've experienced this game since early access and I have to say that it has came a long way since. The full game release has killed many bugs and introduced some (no doubt) but it has also introduced a better UI more content such as items maps and vehicles and a whole new desert map. the developers have definitely been pulling their weight around this game and I expect a whole lot more bug fixes and content they already have a snow map underway so i'm quite impressed compared to the devs that worked on H1Z1. Gameplay wise it is a little bit of a hard game in the sense that getting used to it takes some time but eventually you learn more by just playing and experiencing the game so play it a bit before you judge the game as a whole. I mostly play duos or squads with my friends and I must say towards the end of the game when there is about 10 people left is where it becomes really thrilling either that or you get your legs cut off and left there to die because that er had the high ground. To excel at this game you need good situational aweness or else you're just going to get mad that you died randomly. Playing alone is more of a challenge although it can be easier in other ways. Overall great game just takes a bit of time of getting used to.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

1/2/2018,0,0,35,FALSE,Recommended,A game you won't regret buying! I was orignally planning to buy PUBG much earlier then I had however my hopes for the game were very low mainly after watching videos of very early access gameplay which showed very little promise due to the vast amount of bugs packed in with the game and terrible ping and latency issues. This game almost reminded me of Rainbow Six Siege being as though that game is still packed with bugs and ping issues even though we are moving on to year 3! Another reason why I was persuaded not to purchase this game was because I never really thought Battle Royal games would be my type of thing. Eventually I purchased this game after the Steam Winter Sale and some of my friends almost forcing me to. As soon as I played my first game (although I was terrible and died at the start) I loved the game to bits! You wouldn't expect a team based game like PUBG would be fun solo however due to the amount of things I could do compared to knock off games such as Fortnite kept me occupied for as long as I was alive for. Squad play blew me away even more as the situations you get into are incredibly fun and the amount of team work required for this game is amazing as well as the satisfaction of getting a good team position or even 1st. I would definitely make sure to have friends to play with to get the full experience from it. The best part about it is that most of the buggy mess from early access seems to be gone and due to smart choice from the developers to implement BattlEye I almost never encounter a cheater. This seems to be more of an issue in the Asian servers according to others however I am solely basing this on the EU servers.Would most definitely purchase this game even if you have no intrest with games of such and I can assure you will enjoy it however I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game if you aren't living near either the EU or the US servers as there seems to be a big cheating issue at this current point of time in Oceania and Asia.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The combat in this game seems to mostly function accurately. (opposed to hitboxes not working very well) The game at its core is quite fun and works to expectations.

9/4/2017,0,0,854,TRUE,Recommended,I will start with this it only takes one round to understand why this game is so special.PUBG is one of the most elegantly designed shooters ever created. Here s how it works up to a hundred unarmed players parachute down into a vast map. They find weapons armor and vehicles. As time passes the safe play area shrinks forcing players into the same region of the map. The last person alive wins.That s pretty much it. And yes you may have noticed that it is pretty much the movie Battle Royale in video game form. In fact PUBG's namesake creator Brendan PlayerUnknown Greene cut his teeth developing similar mods for games like ARMA 2 and 3. PUBG however is built entirely around this structure and it s this purity and focus that makes it so accessible. The game s balance is a lot less forgiving than Halo or Call of Duty but it s not quite as harshly realistic as ARMA.What this means is that basically anyone can jump in and have a meaningful experience. Everyone starts in the same vulnerable situation and every kill is significant. Winning or being the last person standing is immensely difficult but since the scoring system is so simple it s always tempting to try to improve your ranking next time. And PUBG isn t shy about including elements of luck even the most skilled player might find themselves landing in an area oddly bereft of weaponry beyond a frying pan and getting rifled in the back.Every time I'm in the final ten players have been among the most intense gaming experiences of my life. Everything you do becomes a small but profound decision. Do you wait inside that room and stay safe for now but risk having to blow your own cover when the play area gets smaller? Do you attack that other player now or hope she doesn t notice you and wanders into a more compromised position down the line? Do you draw attention to yourself by using a loud vehicle to cover more ground or can you make it to the safe zone in time while keeping quiet?PUBG has none of the trappings of online shooters that I ve found so off putting for the past decade. There s no way to reliably game the map no requirement to put up with usually offensive voice chat no oppressive metagame that requires you to spend every waking hour playing if you have any hope of catching up. Each game rarely lasts more than half an hour and even that s only if you re playing very well. Anyone with a basic grasp of shooters can have fun with PUBG.That said the game is clearly unfinished. You may find yourself cursing the netcode when you die due to lag. The visuals are distinctly unpretty even if you re not one of the many players that turns down everything except draw distance for competitive reasons. Jumping over knee high obstacles is weirdly difficult. And you need a beefy Windows PC right now despite the unimpressive results.Overall I highly recommend you purchase the game if you like the sound of it from my review and if you think you will be able to run it on your pc system.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

1/27/2018,0,0,368,FALSE,Recommended,Well let's start from the beginning.When I bought this game I was extremely excited to try it out after watching so many funny clips on youtube. Sadly I was disappointed by the performance issues that the game had at that time and it was not something you could easily get over because of moments when you would make it to top 10 and then just die because of a freeze or some drastic frame drops. BUT this was all before the official release and all the other updates that followed updates that significantly improved the performance of the game as well as the server lag. I'm glad to see the developers really showing interest in making the game a better experience for everyone and taking their time to fix bugs and get rid of cheaters. Since these big updates I've had so much fun with the game in every aspect. Both TPP and FPP are enjoyable wether you're playing solo duo with a friend/random or squad. The game really manages to create tension every fight being unique in it's own way. Fighting scenarios vary a lot due to a large weapon and attachments selection as well as different types of terrain that play an important part in the way you come up with tactics to stay alive so you could get that chicken dinner. However quite a few things can still be improved. One of them being vehicles. Man I really hate when your vehicle can pretty much go over any hill and through bumpy areas but somehow manages to get stuck in a little piece of terrain. Overall I'd say this is a very fun game that offers a unique experience. In my opinion this is the best battle royale game up to date and I say it has a bright future ahead of it.9/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

3/23/2017,0,0,455,TRUE,Recommended,PUBG is an online survival based game in which the objective is to survive against other human players scavenging around the entire map for weapons attachments boosters vehicles and and medical supplies. All of this and the ever closing threat of a dangerous fog surrounding the map which in turn every so often stops for a certain time then changes the point of intrest for you to get to. My thoughts on the game are a follows PROS 1. Friends fun The game is in my opinion much more entertaining when accompanied with friends whether with 1 or 4 other people. (1player Solo 2 People duos and 3 5 players Fives)2. Tension When you play this game whether in solo duos or fives it gets really tense as you see the number of people remaining go down on your screen. Also as you look around for your vital survival equipment you know that just next door could be another player.3. How getting kills can be satisfying How does this game do it? when you are roaming the map or checking out villages coming across players 99% of the time result in gun fights then proceed to kill someone you get a feeling of accomplishment and that you have earned whatever place you finish. (Many other shooters lack this feeling)4. Game feels realistic and has a very rewarding feel to it!CONS 1.The one thing i was hoping this game was gonna do different was add more than 1 map. I know maps are very time consuming but playing on the same map 1 000 000 times eventually gets boring.2. Being in Alpha obviously means there is going to be a lot of Bugs and Glitches some games you will lag out/lose connection game crashes and lots of annoying bugs like that.my conclusion is that this game is a great battle royale game and is one of the only BR games that has done it right! Possibly my most upcoming game of the year! ) RATING Action/Gunfights 10/10Fun 10/10Servers 8/10FPS 8/10loot 10/10playing with friends 10/10Overall i would rate this game a 9/10 just untill they fix the bugs and lag at that point i would probably go far enough to rate this a 10/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
3/23/2017,0,0,622,TRUE,Recommended,I played this game during the Beta and really enjoyed it I have also played quite a bit of King of the Kill and find this game to be similar in play style but different in actual experience this game feels a bit more realistic all items are found and nothing is crafted (currentley) it is extremely satisfying when you sucsesfully kill another player and firing the gun is very rewarding. The player experience feels more gritty and raw and its very fun and addicting. Weapon damage seems as though it more realistic than other battlegrounds because one or 2 shots well placed and you are dead also bullet trajectory and ballistics feel more closely to actual ballistics.If you are a fan of Battleground/ survivial PVP genre games I would DEFINITELY pick this one up.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

10/2/2017,0,0,38,TRUE,Recommended,I figured after the recent spike in negative reviews I should include my own. recently PUBG has been hit with negative reviews from chinese players complaining about an AD running in the game and add which was not displayed anywhere else in the world. the reviews are coming from people playing on other servers with high ping intentionally and are not happy they are being served a resolution.The game itself is great for what it is 100 man free for all death match (unless in squads)there are a few bugs here and there as with most new games but the development team is still very much active at continuing to produce and improve this game. the community is very active and as of yet you will have no problems finding a match as I've never been in a queue more than 30 seconds.

5/25/2017,0,0,880,TRUE,Recommended,Okay well I've played this game for almost 250 hoursI think and I still find it very fun and Im not here to blow out steam Im here to show legit problems if people were wondering. In this review the cons are the most important and almost every big bug is listed. Thankfully the game company has been awesome and fixing most issues people had before this review so I hope they keep up the good work and soon have the fun as crap game they've made without these big bugs/issues.PROS Fun game All you could want from a battle royal game VARIOUS SCOPES FOR ALL RANGES Great game to play with friends Game company is great on adding new content and giving big patches for fixing lots of problems.CONS Game crashes (used to be a lot but now doesn't happen often) Beggining game lag (cant walk in/out of buildings loot fight well for first 30seconds 1 minute after landing) GETTING SHOT AFTER TAKING COVER (I've had people shoot 3 4 bullets into me after taking cover a good second earlier and solo games it seems to be even worse). Vehicles flip on the slightest bumps and even invisible breaks between terrain. The game company after each patch will have some new stupid error left in the game (Now blue circle just keeps closing a lot farther in than it should but does no damage to player) Floating buildings have spawned in on open fields water and other places they're not supposed to be. (Only few people per match see these buildings though which give others advantages ESPECIALLY IF ITS IN THE MIDDLE OF LAST 3 ZONES!)**** Very very rarely there is this audio bug and the game makes an ear peircing static noise that comes through at probably about 3x the volume you have your volume set at. (HURTS EARS)**** Rarely and randomly entire games will lag to where game freezes for a few seconds during fight and bullets will sound choppy and players will put in a lot more shots into you than you hear or feel until your downed. (Worst part is its hard to tell if a game is laggy until getting into a fight)I hope this either helped someone decide whether to get this game or not but even with all these bugs I would still reccomend this game its THAT good. Or if you already have this game and is seeing if someone else feels your pain with these bugs... I do...but we can make it through haha.EXTRA TIP You can crouch jump in this game by pushing spacebar+C at same time pretty much but push spacebar the tiniest moment you can before hitting C... or just spam it and find what works for you (,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I dealt with the unpolished never updated H1Z1 and was becoming less interested in these ""hunger games"" type shooters. however 20 hours in Battlegrounds this game has definitely tickled my fancy. The ""jump whenever you are ready to spawn"" feature is only 1 of several perks to this game that definitely sold me when i first started playing. Spectating your teammate when you die so they can critic his shots and movement was another positive upgrade from previous team based shooters i have played. And last but certainly not least are the weapons and attachments. The ""snap"" to FPS as you have an ACOG attached and the pin point accuracy of the bullets leaving my rifle seem excellent considering this game is in a Beta. I look forward to seeing what else this game can push considering its already better than any Free for All ive played thusfar. MUST BUY and only concern i have is Server Lag.

6/6/2017,0,0,91,TRUE,Recommended,With a mid range GPU and a upper mid range CPU this game runs surprisingly well for an early access game despite what I was told I went in expecting a low amount of frames and having to lower graphic settings to be suprised I averaged 50 75 FPS with some great graphics on it's highest settings. After playing the Battle Royale mod in Arma 3 I feel absolutely comfortable in saying that this game runs and works on many levels better than the mods ever did not to downplay thier success. The gameplay is fast and exciting but can vary to quiet and eerie and allows you for the most part to take your own pace while still pushing players closer together every few minutes. From long and mid range battles on hillsides apartment shootouts and close range combat while clearing rooms the game offers combat that can suit different play types allowing you to bring your own style into the game.With the community guides and tutorials even the least experienced players can enjoy and have a good shot at winning their share of matches. The game is well rounded enough that within the first day after trying both Squad play and Duo play I was able to win a solo match. This game is fun with friends and even alone on solo play which I can't say for many games like it. It is an all around thrilling experience and I absolutely recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

3/26/2017,0,0,454,TRUE,Recommended,This game is best played with friends in duo/squad mode. Solo mode is fun enough but nothing compares to roaming the 8x8km map with your buddies. YOU MAY NOT ENJOY THIS GAME IF You dislike slow paced games where you can die in an instant without ever seeing your attacker. However planning your movement to avoid these situations is part of the fun and eventually you will be the one sniping at long range from behind cover. You dislike lots of randomness. The loot distribution is fairly random with some areas having higher concentrations of good gear than others (these areas tend to attract more players though). The path of the plane is random. The restriction of the play area is random. However learning to manage this randomness is part of the fun and the different conditions each round lead to diverse strategic options. You like winning reasonable frequently (50% of the time or more). Each game starts with 100 players and only 1 player can win. This game has a lot in common with roguelikes where you lose frequently but get further and further as you improve.The game also has some serious technical deficienies and much needed features Performance is bad even on a high end rig. I recommend turning all settings to VERY LOW. Performance optimizations should arrive in the next 5 weeks. There is no practice range which means that it is difficult to learn the guns.These flaws are acceptable to me because this game is extremely fun and reasonably balanced for an early access title. It has the potential to be the leader in this genre if the developers can deliver on their early access promises.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
4/18/2017,0,0,289,TRUE,Recommended,This game is great.So if you run this game on high with a GTX1060 for me it runs around 60fps and thats playable.I think that it is a little buggy and sometimes you take random damage or a small bumb sends your car flying.I think when this game is opomized it should be great. I think that if this game is worked on a little it will be great. It feels not to smooth sometimes and if they can get it to be smooth this would be one of my favorite games.So now I have played it more after it was optomized and love it this game is great and I like the new Kriss Vector aswell.

Okay here is a problem it's not nearly done. I've played this game somewhere around 20h in total and i feel that without content updates it will get boring after some time. But that's not the worst part... Optimization of the game is awfull and i highly recommend not to get it if you got weak computer c'mon even assasin's creed unity did it better. I got carried away a little bit. Anyway back to to the topic.The game is ""battle royal"" game. It's basically you and 99 more people (isn't dat impressive?) killing each other and trying to stay in the constantly closing sircle and this part of the game is really fun... atleast in the beggining... then it get really intense with constantly raising heartbeat searching for a good spot to sit and wait. this game teaches you to be patience and calm. Honestly it can become GREAT game BUT not now.A horrible tech partB price tag is really big for early acces gameC not so big amount of content /h1 conclusion /h1 I RECOMMEND to play it BUT i DON'T RCOMMEND to BUY it now.wait a little somewhere around 1 3 months OR atleast buy it for a lower price.hope my post will help somebody.

So if you want a halfway decent framerate you need these GTX 10 series GPU (preferably 1050 ti or above. You can have an equivalent AMD GPU. I highly recommend more than 2gb of VRAM)AMD Athlon x4 2.8Ghz (or equivalent.)8Gb ddr3 RAMEither a SSD Hybrid or fast as HDDThese specs can get you 30FPS to 144FPS (Mostly depends on amount of RAM and what GPU you have.)

Right now the hacking is out of control I could never recommend this game in its current state. BattleEye is a JOKE! Fundamentally the game is fairly sound (it needs mantling bad) but there honestly is no point in playing it in today's current state with all the cheaters. Also the game crashes have been out of hand there doesn't go a day without it crashing or disconnecting you.*** Update 1/1/2018 ***The game crashes have gotten better after the launch day patch. They are still present just not as often.Hackers still bad as ever check back here periodically for video proof!Mantling and vehicle mechanics updated with launch day patch huge improvment but again the game is ruined with hackers and cheaters. I still do not recommend you supporting Blue Hole whatsoever until they address this dire issue! Nothing worse than spending 20 minutes in a game to get wrecked by a aimbotter who's armor never takes damage. The problem here is cheaters effect 99 other players not just a lobby of 10 or 16 like other games! Banning half a million players is NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT! That speaks volumes that your ""anti cheat"" system does not work! Blue Hole is dragging their tail when it comes to countermeasures for hacks. REACTIVE vs PROACTIVE!*** Update 1/19/2018 hacking still going strong. New hacks now shoot threw everything and instant revive!*** Update 1/25/2018 hacks still alive and well after patch 3.

12/20/2017,0,0,345,TRUE,Recommended,The rubberbanding/lag at the start of matches can be low bad or horrendus but about a minute after landing there is almost none.The game is fun to play both alone and with firends IMO better with firends. And if you don't have a lot of friends who play PUBG there are a lot of community discords which you can google and find fun people to play with.If you're looking for an esport to get good at I'd not get too existed. The game has no other objective (currently) other than to survive which leads to the best tactics being camping which again leads to very boring gameplay from a viewers perspective unless the player is someone you follow. And this isin't even taking into account the logistical problem of getting 100 people together for a turnament but maybe they could reduce the map size lower this number.TLDR Fun game to play both alone and with friends with a few technical issues. Developers are active and it's easy to participate in the developement community.

This game has alot of issues like dying while opening a door shooting bullets that dont hit due to bad tickrate But the biggest issue OPTIMISATION. This game has bad optimisation but to give them slack it is only in early access what do you expect. Besides all of that the game has alot of stuff to do and can have tons of hours spent into learning new skills positions strats and heaps more. Ive spent roughly 300 hours playing and im learning lots of new thing everytime i play. Another great thing about this game is the test servers. This is a great way of showing the community the ""future"" of their game. By doing this it allows the community to give feedback on the games development and point out any issues that may hurt the games enjoyment or stability. Once this game reachers 1.0 ( which it will in a couple of hours lol) i believe the developers will have achieved their goals and the community will be satisfied.

6/27/2017,0,0,263,TRUE,Recommended,PUBG is a very fun game to play on your own or with a group of people although it is terribly optimised at the moment. Overall the game is amazing and I do intend on spending more hours playing it but recently I have been obsessed with the test servers the new features that are coming are incredible.First of all the devs are bringing vaulting to the game which changed the way the game is played completely with vaulting you can climb through the windows climb over walls which are impossible to just jump over and it can be used when trying to escape enemies. For instance when I heard an enemy above me in a building he was able to jump through one of the windows that was already broken and then sneak up behind me before the vaulting was out this was pretty much impossible without someone hearing you.Secondly the game has been optimised with the 1.0 update but it still isn't the easiest to run. I currnetly have a GTX 750ti an i5 6500 and 8gb of RAM and I am able to run it at about medium settings but it still crashes and has it moment I think this is down to the amount of RAM I have personally. But if you own a 10 series graphics card or the equivelent for AMD the same or better CPU and 16gb of RAM you should be able to run this game fine in the 1.0 update.And third the devs have brought a new map with this update Miramar which has a completely different play style to the original map Erangel. Miramar is a massive map almost double the size of Erangel and if you drop somewhere like Los Leones you meet very little enemies but the loot is incredible. This map is more slow going than the other one with much more sniper play so make sure you have a long range weapon on hand. I would like to see some more weather variations come to this map like a desert storm which restrics view and elimiantes most long range battles.I believe 1.0 is releasing around 15 hours after I have wrote this review so I can't wait for that.I honestly don't have many complaints and any I did have have been eliminated by the 1.0 update for example optimisation. Before 1.0 I struggled to get textures until about 5 minutes of waiting and by that time I was probably already dead.I would recommened this game to anyone whos looking for a thrilling new game and I can't honestly compare it to the main contender Fortnite but just from looking I believe PlayerUnkown is a much better game and is worth every penny.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

7/9/2017,0,0,324,TRUE,Recommended,Lets be honest here most of us who had H1Z1 spoiled the game genre of battle royale. But when you come across this game and try it out the combat is phenomenal every second of it which is about maybe 40 70% of the game depending on how you play or your play style fits into the game. It is so fun for a majority for people because you can play how you would like camping buildings rushing high populated areas etc. You can play it how you want to and its special in that way. The devs are doing a really good job keeping the community close and working hard to make it come out for release. A game that is actually good in early access and when it came out? I never heard of such games but this could be the one and im 100% going to be with it untill it releases. I recommend it to anyone who is interested you will not regret.. Also you may want to find some friends to play with because depending you may not like solo's. One downside thought is that is crashes almost every 5 matches or so but keep in mind dev's are trying their best to fix all the bugs. And it is worth crashing every time to play this game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
7/11/2017,0,0,1163,TRUE,Recommended,Well it's in early acces so of course you'll encounter bugs slow in performance and the game will be rough around the edge. This said..THE GAMEPLAY IS AWESOME!!

Various weapons and attachments Running people over in a car is funny afCons Revive system can be annoying in Duos or Group (Long range gunfights can be annoying if they have cover as the friend will get revived multiple times) Needs to be optimized better.

12/9/2017,0,0,992,TRUE,Recommended,Exhilarating thrilling and scary. The main boss is you!That is of course after playing for a while and getting some awesome feeling wins under your belt. Learning the map the guns the bullet drop and especially the way the other players act and react in different and similar ways and the intriguing predictability of where the players might be and how they might manoeuvre. This early access game tickles out a lot of primal emotions and instinctive decision making moves out of my core. This game is a lot deeper than people think. The fear of dying or at least losing loot and starting over again mixed with the adrenaline of the hunt or just plain fun and reckless combat.I love the realism of firearms the random spray patterns and how you can get comfortable with your favourite and how you push yourself to practice with the ones you might have hated.RESPECT THE ZONE! There are a million ways to die in this game but the most common one for me is this necessary evil.You might hate this game because you keep getting shot from who knows where or you might love it like I do because of it's raw ridiculous and infinite ways of playing or getting lost in the recurring nightmare of possibilities or what ifs. Anyway great game. Now buy it and let me kill you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
1/11/2018,0,0,403,FALSE,Recommended,After about 300 hours on PUBG you relize its a game you love and you hate. 1.0 was much needed patch and dropping into the new desert map was like droping in for the first time in Erengel. But after about 30 hours on the test server and another 50 hours on the live servers of 1.0 some of the changes have out stayed their welcome. The worst one of all seems to be the loot system. I dont know if its changed in 1.0 but since i have had multiple matches in a row on both maps where ill get to the end game top 10 or 15 or even 5 and all i have managed to find after dropping at a town such as Las Leones or Yas and looting every building i can and attempting to kill every player i see on the way to the zone to roll up with if im lucky a assualt rifle. Even better when i land ill run into the house or appartment loot every single floor and get a 1911 why the guy accross the street in his little one bedroom house leaves and kills me with a M4 SkS combo. Then the icing on the cake is when i finaly get a good loadout and make it to the zone i get killed by some aimbotting hacker who snaps to my head and drops me.But Ive put in 300 hours and i will keep playing hating and loving the game the whole time.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

12/22/2017,0,0,606,FALSE,Recommended,A HONEST REVIEW ABOUT MIRAMAR AND PUBG V1.0As where Erangel was suited for sneaky players traversing on foot hiding behind every tree the threat in miramar lies in its vast open spaces and it is truly a map designed for vehicular travel and frantic action..... but it leaves me hoping for a map select option. You see i tend to like the gameplay more so on Erangel then Miramar.... especially for solo play Erangel gave you a sense of tactic and bravado when you absolutely needed to cross a open space so you bolted and was happy when you reached the next crest of a hill or rock thinking your safe. Miramar is just this all the time.... there is never a moment where you can relax its 360 degrees of exposure at all times and cities are far and wide between.... if that sounds appealing if this is your jam then by all means play Miramar.... its a nicely designed map for that type of action packed gameplay... as for me ill see you oldskool pubg players on Erangel i cant handle the change... oow yeah and vaulting works well but i prefer the old ways slower is betterGrandpa signing off,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
9/24/2017,1,1,78,TRUE,Recommended,TBH IDK what the deal is with the FRing Streamers but I haven't experienced it so why would I give it a bad review if it doesn't personally affect me and I like the game? It's very dumb for these people to be giving this great game a negative review. Maybe if you have a legitamate argument on why you don't enjoy the game with that as a reason then sure by all means. But if you are here just to join the bandwagon then thats kind of dumb. I have only seen TWO stories of people getting banned from this. Me and my 2 other friends that play this have not gotten banned at all.Anyways here are some pros and cons and my explanation on why I personally enjoy this game.Pros Good with friends good alone. Matchmaking doesn't give you empty squads but I have had instances were everyone left the squad pre game.In game voice is flawless no need to add randos on steam.The loot is abundant however its possible to get nothing but a pistol for the rest of the game unfortunately.Cars frequently spawn but only on the outer edges of the map. Anywhere else won't usually give you one.If you only like first person then great! The game has you covered just queue for FPP modes.Very easy to figure out what to do and how to play I knew what to do by my second match. Watch gameplays they help (although I didn't personally watch any.)Cons Honestly there is some lag between you and server which is bad because everyone sends signals to the server and you recieve them back its not p2p so you could unload into someone then they 2 shot you 1 second later and they are fine and you are dead.You can easily run yourself over make sure the vehicle is completely stationary before attempting to exit.Somehow somewhere there are people dropping to the same location and are getting there first. I don't understand I have looked at strategies all over the internet and still people will land before you.Honestly to me the pros outway the cons. The games matchmaking is shockingly fast as the game surpassed Dota 2 and CS GO in all time player peaks breaking several records its not surprising. The last 2 things I want to say is to make sure you look up strats and buy the game now its not on sale and it WILL NOT BE TRUST ME ON THIS. It won the summer sale without going on sale... So yeah if I were them I wouldn't put it on sale either.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

That aside this is one of the first games in a long time to really draw me into it. Genuinely winning firefights or picking people off feels so rewarding but it's nothing compared to being in the final 5 players as the zone tightens.

5/23/2017,0,0,372,FALSE,Recommended,PositiveGraphics The graphics are good and makes the game even more interesting and challenging when you always have to keep an eye open for enemies. Aim is not the only thing that matters you also need to think about the zone terrain what you carry where you go what you hear etc. Sound/Music Sounds and music works great but it chould be better at some point. The game also suprise you in different ways you can't imagine og expect. Controls Controls are configured as expected and feel a lot more responsive now that it did when it first came out. Gameplay The gameplay is fun and challenging.Personal thoughts Would love to see how the game will develop in the future. Developers have done a great job since launch. The game is the post played atm (3 100 000 on January 2018). Clearly the developers are doing a great job and people are loving this game. A lot of different changes and additionals have been made into the game and are more to come as mentioned by the game dev team and the creator it selfs on Twitter so it looks like they have a lot of stuff comming up. A big thumbs up from me!The game it self in my opinion is really good and I've had so much fun with it. It's a great game for being in it's current state as it got out of early access.Some people just hate the developers because of how they ban people and bringing crates into the game. In my opinion if you don't play fair or can't follow the rules you should get banned. IDC if they puts crates into the game it's does't give you any kind of advantage anyway. If you don't like it then don't ing buy it. Give the devs an oppertunity to work on this game for years even after early access. Just keep in mind they don't work for free.There's a reason why it is the most played game on steam atm...Negative Gameplay Inventory can be better Gameplay Hit registration can be better Gameplay Some poor server performance.Summary Graphics 9 5 Sound/Music 8 Controls 8 5 Gameplay 8 5 Road out of early access 9 5 Developers 9 5 Personal thoughts 9 5 Fantastic game 9/10ChangelogJanuary 14th 2018 9/10 (Adjustment made because they got out of early access)September 16th 2017 8 9/10 (Adjusting my opinions after the recent updates)July 16th 2017 8 4/10 (+ Sounds the cargo plane bug is fixed. + Controls performance on client and server is much better. + Gameplay Experience is a lot better. + Road out of early access. + Developers Great job. + Personal thoughts really like this game.)June 22nd 2017 7 6/10 (+ Server performance improved Makes the controls and movement alot better.

Did I mentioned that in response to these complains PlayerUnknown himself stated that he was shocked by the amounbt of Xenophobes in his player base.

1/2/2018,0,0,360,FALSE,Recommended,This game is one of THE biggest reasons why I finally got a gaming PC. The battle Royale genre was modernized by this game and it's easy to jump right in to learn the gameplay and mechanics and have a good time. I HIGHLY recommend this game if you enjoy ANY 1 3 person PvP. You parachute down on to 1 of 2 maps and loot buildings and areas with up to 99 other players and the goal is to be the final survivor or your squad to be the last team standing. The game keeps people from spending an entire game camping in one spot due to a ever shrinking circle forcing players to move in as the numbers dwindle keeping gameplay moving. My ONLY complaints about this game as of writing this is there are SO many chinese flooding the North American servers and kind of ruining the experience for other players looking to team up with a random player from North America and speaks your language. The other complaint that can't be fixed unfortunately is there will ALWAYS be hackers in online multiplayer games. I will admit that Bluehole and PUBG have done a decent job making it seem like it's minimal at least to me and it hasn't turned me off to the game and I feel that if I don't win a match it's due to coming up against a better player and situation rather than someone cheating.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You either gun down that entire squad at military base single handed or you get aimbotted with a P92 by a Chinese player in Rozhok. Take the game as it is with a pinch of salt. It's a fantastic battle royale experience without the polish. Don't leave a bad review because your vehicle flipped over and killed you in a top ten situation when you could just as easily appreciate the outweighing amount of enjoyable and intense moments that the game brings to the table and go away feeling good about your purchase.Ultimately it needs some work but regardless it's a great game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
3/28/2017,0,0,116,FALSE,Recommended,Updated for post release There's a reason devs are ripping off this game. The formula is solid. Sure there's going to be new twists on this style of game and improvements but PUBG is solid in it's simple design. It's not a game that demands huge amounts of your time but if you chose to dedicate yourself it'd pay off.Its great to load up when you have an hour or so to spare and it's great for an evening of gaming with friends too. Even if you aren't good or experienced with FPS or battle royale styles of games it's fun.The replays are a lot of fun to watch back and include the ability to spectate who else was near by and what was happening around you during past matches which could be really useful to someone trying to git gud or for someone like me is just fun to see how wrong things could or did go.There are issues sometimes with rubber banding and I think there's small improvements to be made to just the over all polish but having seen it grow through development I have faith in the devs that these things will be sorted. I'd say this is a must buy for anyone who has ever played and enjoyed FPS games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Also surround sound is non existant so if you get shot from a distance or even behind you have nothing to do but die because it sounds like someone is shooting inside your ear canals.Other than that the game is pretty fun the rubberbanding seems to go away after the first minute or so too.If you are calm enough not to throw your keyboard to the moon when you die because you were right next to a gun after landing but another guy gets to it first because you were rubberbanding like then go ahead get this game.

11/22/2017,0,0,198,TRUE,Recommended,"When I started seeing this game pop up on my steam friends' feed I thought ""that's a weird title is that even a game?"" and I continued to ignore it until one day I was at a buddy's house and he asked if I'd played it. He showed me what it was A game in the style of Battle Royale the movie (of course at this point everyone knows this but at the time I was perhaps blissfully unaware). I immediately thought ""This is what I've been waiting for!"" and opened the steam app and remote purchased it started it downloading before I went home.Fast forward to today I've put a fair amount of hours in. Nothing like the crazy pros but enough to have a pretty good feel for it. It's definitely a love/hate relationship. The love is when your heart is racing you're in the top ten you've got a real shot at winning this match. The moment you find an 8x scope or a weapon drop that gets you going. When you and your teammates do something crazy and it actually works. There are so many great stories. It may be the ultimate anecdote factory.The hate (hate is too strong a word maybe annoyance) is when you die to lag the servers are down in your one hour of a chance to play this week You drop and your parachute goes wonky and you end up stuck in a grain silo with literally no way out (ever heard of invisible barriers bluehole?) you spend 20 minutes scrambling for the inside of the circle only to die because the RNG dropped it on the complete opposite side of the map from you and spawned no vehicles. And so on...But for all it's jank and messiness I've had some of the most fun and most tense moments I've ever had in gaming while playing this game so I have to give it credit and a thumbs up for that.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Game used to run like ..fps drops and server lags (rubber banding and i couldnt even opent a door) but the new update (1.0) it runs smooooooth. I thought the game was not ready for full release but update 1.0 literally fixed everything. Servers are decent with a little lag sometime especially at the start of the match but it is bearable. The fps is smoooooth af. For the best possible experience make sure your greaphics drivers are up to date.

Devs have done a great job on optimizing this game so it's a hell of a lot better than when i originally bought it and indeed gave up on it. I don't play sub 60fps games personally not in 2017 it's unacceptable. So glad to see the devs have put in the work and got this running properly. No point going into a full blown review on the game.

7/27/2017,0,0,18,TRUE,Recommended,The game is highly enjoyable thus far. If you are like me and don't play multi player games due to people's behaviour on the internet this might be up your alley.If you play solo you can mute speech and never talk to anyone.Of course that also means you don't have to deal with the internet and their complete lack of social skills.I never have issues finding a match quickly and it's always fun to play whether I do well in the match or not.It's just good fun. I highly recommend this.As for loot boxes whatever. Not a big deal at all as I have self control and will not be giving someone money to purchase purposeless clothing for my guy.

6/30/2017,0,0,475,TRUE,Recommended,Addictive third person shooter.The devs do sort of good updates although separately each update has little effect but overall the game has improved since launch.Pro the gunplay and overall felling of the gameCons cars explode if you fire enough bullets at them lags tons of it slightly worse netcode/game response time than expected low fps even on the best machines the forcefield and playzones are the creation of the devil the map its not made for this kind of battle royale it would be more suited for H1Z1 but not here. The white circle almost everytime is RNGed in an open field or u just happen to be on the half with no cover VERY BIG CON The forcefield is transparent therefore many unwanted stuff can happen such as 1.You can be camped from inside the playzone while you try to run into it. 2.Some noobs who don't have any chance of survival because they started running too late can pick you off even though you can still make it them being 100m behind you.Conclusion Would die by force field again 10/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

5/26/2017,0,0,178,TRUE,Recommended,This is easily one of the best games I have played in a long time!I highly recommended it if you can get a squad of 4 together that are able to communicate well.No other game has felt so life like and so tactical. Also they are talking about adding in more guns maps features and mechanics to the game. And as far as I am aware all for free!Another huge plus is how active the developers are and how well they communicate.PU BG might be one of the few Early Access games I have bought but this is Early Access done right!I give it a 9/10. Only issues are clients side and server side performance issues (such as poor FPS and lag) but the developers have stated they are aware of the issues and have already begun fixing it. Several patches have already been released. I am very confident these issues will be resolved before their full release.Easily worth $30.00!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Just today to get into it I needed to launch it several times due to several crashes when attempting to load the main menu. Thankfully that is the worst bug I am encountering though that is not true for everyone.Why do I recommend this game? Because all that aside it is fun. The bugs aren't aggravating and the experience is overall worth the money. Now in many other games I would dismiss these bugs as inexcuseable but I understand that these large map realistic physics games are hard to get right. Even the oldest people in this genre Bohemia Interactive still can't get everything just right. And the PUBG team has demonstrated that things get better.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Rampant cheating bugs and optimization issues keep people from enjoying the game.For all the bad things behind the curtain though whats put on the set is fun and engaging as well as new efforts by the developers to give a sense of progression through the game.

We've all seen it everyones talking about it its dirt cheap and everyone seams to love it......So why as a self confessed 'GAMER' did it take me so long to take a punt on this fine game?

5/13/2018,0,0,43,FALSE,Recommended,"I think this game is pretty top kek and worth the money. The most of the negative reviews sound like they are coming from people who just died a lot and said they were killed by aimbotters ""through the wall"" when most likely they were just shot through a window that they didn't notice or they just have too much lag due to a slow PC trying to run the settings at max. I like the fact that there are no in game purchases besides the market and the ones that are there are reasonably priced besides the extremely rare items. Fortnite however is free so it relies on overpriced currency called ""V bucks"" which are only used for cosmetics and emotes so instead of paying for content you pay for actual PUBG has none of this and is fun especially with friends. A few cons are that it can lag sometimes very slightly on its own and other times you can be killed by someone intentionally playing on the north american server when they are actually in china which sucks Overall rating 9.5/10 Would meme againpretty top kek game i recommend",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

8/15/2018,0,0,2006,FALSE,Recommended,Still remember the first time i jumped out of the plane in Erangel and landed in Yasnaya. Didn't know about the game but the excitement was real. Looting the good stuff (coats hats and to look cool) i even prefered a black baseball cap over lvl 1 helmet LUL. I also remember my first kill it was with a shotgun in the mighty moomin house (in Mylta i guess).I played my first 200 ish hours as TPP and it took me 97 hours of gameplay to get my first chicken dinner. The first few hundred matches were exciting as hell and reaching the top 10 made my heart rate to go over 9000.Running 10km per game because you didn't know the car spawns dropping at small compounds because you weren't brave enough to drop at big boys' places such as Military Base and Georgopol.Fog was annoying as hell you couldn't see everyone was proned or camping in a building. Scopes were because the edges were so t h i c c. C jumping was a thing and i loved it. The old main menu and theme song were better imo.Frustrating things are 1. Dsync2. Losing health after diving when you clearly are at the surface already before you run out of breath3. Rub your guns in windows and stair railingsNonetheless PUBG was and is very refreshing after thousands of hours of basically only CS 1.6 CSGO and OSRS.

9/11/2018,0,0,572,FALSE,Recommended,I bought this game as recomended by a friend recently in a sale. It fits nicely into the simulation/survival niche it ticks my boxes between fast arcade gameplay and brutal simulation......and manages this very well. Short fast games with barely time to think.....at the very least it's teaching me some good map reading skills.Too add some context i'm a long suffering DayZ fan that got tired of waiting. I uninstalled that game recently after 6 7(?) years of waiting patiently for a release. PUBG fits the gap perfectly spookyily almost i still pinch myself to remind me that its an Unreal engine port of DayZ which is a standalone version of a Mod that ran on ArmA2 which is a renamed release of the classic Operation Flashpoint.My only request would be more vehicles a light chopper would be nice. Hell lets just try teams 50v50 limited vehicles with 2 Team zones to be captured. Wouldnt take much effort and would match its rivals for more content.Overall the sound of this game stands out above all else the time delay on distant sniper fire the delay of Thunder after a lightning bolt I would give it 10/10 for sound quality.But overall it needs work on various things stability graphics quality and just a bit more content please!Overall 7/10 (needs some work but has great potential),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

11/17/2017,0,0,1116,TRUE,Recommended,I recommend this game. But with certain caveats. There are several things that are required in order to have the best gaming expereince.1) Even if you have the top of the line gaming computer this does not guarantee a consistently smooth gaming experience. In other words most people with average gaming computers will suffer a bad gaming exeperience from time to time in this game.2) There is a cheating problem however it seems to be centered on the Third person servers. Currently if you play first person then you are much less likely to run into rampant cheating.3) Even if you have the best computer and the game has no cheaters you still have to contend with lag and desync issues from time to time.4) There is no guarantee that bluehole (the game's developer) will ever completely fix any of these issues.Even with all these potential problems I think PUBG offers enough return on your money to get a good 500 hours worth of fun (and occasional frutstration).For 30 dollars that comes to almost 5 cents per hour of fun. You can't beat that. Once you become good at this game the adrenaline rush situations are second to none.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

11/19/2017,0,0,404,TRUE,Not Recommended,Kyle Walton19 November 2014Steam ReviewsThis game has progressively and is continuing to get much much worse. You would think the opposite from a game that's sold millions of copies and is still in early access advancing towards release but absolutely not it seems every aspect of the game continues to somehow get worse and worse every update.To start off the optimization is what can be considered &amp quot quot . I don't have the absolute up and best rig there is but a ryzen 5 1600 and a gtx 1060 6gb shouldn't be struggling to hold frames in a game at 1080p. The amount of network lag in this game is at least 100x what I've seen from any other game I've ever played in almost every single match. The amount of worthless cheating asian players on NA servers is absolutely insane. It seems to be 1/3 games now I'm killed by a cheater. Even more often I see a player rubberbanding around because his/her ping is through the roof and I can get kiled before I even see him/her.The combat in this game is boul honksworth. It's inconsistent and buggy. Some games the AK spray is on lock and easy to use and then the next time I use it it's absolutely ballistic. Some games the SCAR automatic is precise and predictable and sometimes it goes wherever you tell it not to.The graphics are sub par for the specs this game expects you to push. However I will note that I have one good thing to say about this absolutely garbage game it isn't pay to win which is nice for a change.On that not eat my Bluehole this game is terrible please remove it from the Steam Store.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Instead of worrying about the games problems they worry about cosmetics whenever they already made so much money. They keep demanding us money whenever we gave them so much. They are slow with coming out with new features. However the events was a nice idea that was added in. But that is only one thing while there are 10 other things that they did wrong.Overall I would recommend waiting until full release whenever you don't have to worry about game breaking bugs like the three seater bug or being able to vault into a rock and kill people through it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

5/26/2018,0,0,826,FALSE,Not Recommended,A terrible game that is dying. The dev team is a mess and unable to communicate easily within their departments. The game has not delivered on what was promised. There's no mod support there are no custom servers there are no custom maps. There is no way to practice anything other than either the loot simulator or fist fighting if you drop in hot zones. The devs are ruining the competitive community with their lack of knowledge of proper game mechanics and failure to deliver on the bost basic essentials required for a competitive game. The game is still ugly and unoptimized and can barely run on the top end graphics card. Do not buy this unless you have a top of the line cpu graphics card memory and even a top m.2 drive. If you don't have top of the line ram you lose most of your performance and if you don't have an m.2 many game items/buildings will not load in properly and ruin your game.Even the anti cheat is terrible not banning who it should and banning people it shouldn't. A game filled with people aimbotting and flying and they are still wasting time banning people for using povohat's mouse accel. If the third party leaderboards didn't automatically hide cheaters then the leaderboards would reveal the severity of the problem.It's a great idea for a game but another developer needs to swoop in and release a proper version.

This is the only game that is better on a mobile device than on PC or console save yourself $30 and a lot of frustration and enjoy the smartphone version (which incidentally also runs much more smoothly). When the game first came out it must have been great fun but at this point there are too many experts and cheaters that make it almost impossible to get ahead. Several times I dive landed carefully making sure there are no parachutes nearby only to be blasted right upon landing by someone with Level 2 armor and two primary weapons already equipped. ...What the hey?... In 20 games I only landed 4 kills I know I'm bad but I'm not completely terrible with shooters and ended in top 10 a couple times using stealth. When the game is challenging and has a steep learning curve there should be some way to train before sharing the field with experts who've been playing for weeks or months and/or streaming on twitch tv.

The thrill and adrenaline of making it to the late game and winning... I loved it. But that's where the good ends with this game. It ran absolutely terrible for months and months and even today it still isn't a smooth experience. The game is super clunky and it's flooded with bugs. There has also been a lack of content and changes that nobody wanted. Oh but there are plenty of loot boxes and microtransactions. You want a new map? Here's a loot box. You want new guns?

2/11/2018,0,0,205,FALSE,Not Recommended,I used to really enjoy playing this game with friends. I don't have the best graphics card so I lag everywhere on the lowest quality but I would put up with it just to have fun with my friends. The dessert map is what is causing me to dislike this game. It was a good idea at first because it was something new and different but now it's all you ever play on. There is no cover when you are being pushed by the zone across an open field while your being shot from a ridge somewhere and the loot spawns are absolute garbage. I looted 4 different houses and found nothing but clothing items and pistols. Pistols are a complete joke unless you shoot someone point blank in the head and you can't do that when the other person has a shotgun or smg or an assault rifle. My graphics card can barely handle the game and when I get put onto the dessert map that is considerably larger it kills my computer to the point that it's not even worth the money I spent on this game.

7/31/2018,0,0,651,FALSE,Not Recommended,"They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?Mistakes / poor decisions First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players but I guess they went with the cheaper solution. Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping. No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection. Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes so you play to get your points to get the rewards and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace). Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player. STEREO sound... what year is this?? Some ""minor"" issues with game design that could be easily fixed like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest slowing the circles down a bit etc. But compared to the above points these are pretty minor.What would make this game better? Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate. Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate). Actually ban cheaters (IP MAC address etc.). I know there are ways around it but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game. Sell rare items like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace so keep that if you must but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items) it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50 they would make millions. Win win for everyone.If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff. Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their . I will never buy a key to open one and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward greedy ! Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue. Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.If they made these changes I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.Why is it so popular then? It's exciting really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn so everything you do matters and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you where to drop what to loot how long to spend looting where to go when to go there when to fight when to flee etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo duo or squads each mode changing the way you play the game.All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them) or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window sill etc.The most frustrating thing about all that is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese and they make a lot of money from them especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism that's fact.There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers many of them are cheaters some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say ""China numba wun"".Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short sighted money grab when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.Edited to add To those that say ""engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite"" the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1 CS GO COD etc run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything but it's a big part of the network delay between two players and low tickrates can cause other issues.PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8 10Hz with everyone alive and that increases as players die which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I will say that this is still one of the best battle royale genre games out there. With that being stated however this game has a very Love/Hate relationship with most players so if you're not looking for that look elsewhere. Overall the shooting is pretty decent the fact that they smurfed some of the guns is a lot better. and the new scopes they added are amazing so at least I can say they are headed in a positive direction. Just give us the new maps already.Oh and all i'm posting are the most recent cons because I don't want you to be reading for days.CONS They say they've fixed the cheating however it seems like every other game someone sucks and has to use an aimbot to make themselves not suck.

8/3/2017,0,0,601,FALSE,Not Recommended,"Back when the game was Early Access I had a lot of fun and wrote a possitive review about it.But lately with it's official launch and having found nothing but hackers and cheaters being a constant in the game I have to change my positive review to a Negative one.First the PROS The game still has some fun to it dropping in finding gear to hunt down other players (either solo or a team). The game is always an adrenaline rush from the start. This is not your typical CoD Arena fighting. So you either play smart or get shot.The CON Sadly teh CONs have grown a great deal since the game release. The biggest ongoing issue with the game are the hackers and the cheaters. No surprise the majority of which are the Chinese. I realize it may sound stereo typing and racial. But the fact is they are Chinese hackers/cheaters. Just in January (2018) the devs banned 100k players for cheating the majority of which were Chinese. More so as of April (2018) they announced they made 15 arrests IN CHINA. The arrests were on coders selling source code to hack/cheat PUBG. More so these same coders left BACKDOOR programs into the PCs of the ppl who BUY their hack code.So to all those hackers buying cheats from China to win the game. You got E D and deserve it.But even that is not enough to save the game sadly. There are still hacks going on with cheaters using Snap to Target No Recoil Health Regen and Instant Kill Shots. Even more where they instantly gain high tier weapons on drop or survive ourside the blue ring w/ no damage. The latest problem is now the game is trying to pander onto the ""weekly mission"" scheme of gameplay. Like last x hours on this map travel x miles etc. It's killing the sake of the true element of the game in favor of achievements. if I want achievements i'll play CoD.Final Thought In the past I said this is a ""must Buy"". But now with the state of it with hackers cheaters and slow responses from the devs on handling and controlling the problem. I have to say PASS. All their focus has been on new pointless content from swag to skins. With little in the way of battling the hackers still going on.Pro+ survival of the smartest and wittiest+ Some good team players for Team matches+ diversity of weapons gear and vehicles+ Randomized item drops and deploymentCon Chinese hackers Purchased hacks now show they include backdoor programs on their clients.

This is my first negative review ever but this game literally went from my favorite game to the biggest piece of crap of the century not even bacause of the hackers because that could be solved by region locking but because Bluehole are actual pieces of crap. They are great game designers but have some of the worst personalities in existence if you are going to attack your players for wanting to make the game fair again. 500 000/10 Would NEVER EVER RECCOMEND!

Yes it's the most popular game on Steam yes it's out sound 99% of other games on Xbox and yes it wins awards. HOWEVER many of the veteran EA's understand that we have put faith and time into this game to help develop it for the commerical benefit of Bluehole. All we want is to be listened clearly through the mediums available. Yes PUBG is a phenominally addictive game considering it is essentially one map (soon 2) the same thing on repeat BUT each time the parameters change which make for a more exciting time. There's a couple of issues that give me stark reminders of the DEVil (WildCard) bugs keep appearing and it seems they aren't a priority over different means such as rushing releases and adding different competitions or paid loot drops. YES I am still bitter about that. Eitherway I won't stop playing anytime soon I have a time on it it's too late for me I'm hooked but not for you! You can save yourself the headaches RUN AWAY NOW!TL DR just another game dev that made something good and wants to milk it for cash at the expense of the fan base also a HIGHLY addictive game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Recommend staying away until the game is fully released and/or if the issues listed below are fixed.PROS +Cool conceptually+Easy to jump in and out+Short matches+Combat can be intense+Weapon feel is not badCONS TERRIBLY optimized. Memory leaks massive frame drops. Inconsistent framerate. Terrible network issues. Desync lag unstable 20 tick servers poor hitreg is CLIENT SIDE. No region restrictions/ping limits. Some guy from China will be rubber banding and teleporting all over your screen and ruin your run. Poor vehicle physics. Enjoy hitting a pebble with your motorcycle and dying. Aiming system is horrible and inherently broken. When aiming in first person bullets will come out below your crosshair which means you will get caught on a variety of props/walls/corners and be unable to shoot the person you are correctly aiming at. Indoor combat is EXTREMELY clunky as a result. For some reason there are a lot of bars on windows which will prevent you from shooting out properly. Zero bullet penetration for now although the devs have said that this will come in the future. Poorly balanced circle of death (Extremely random and will cost you games. Some runs will be screwed right when you decide to jump leading to a feeling of wasted time/effort spent looting) Unprofessional dev team. They are already breaking promises made earlier and are intending to add a CSGO microtransaction system.

11/4/2017,0,0,153,FALSE,Not Recommended,"What is this game?This game is a ""one game mode"" type of first and third person shooter.You start in a C 130 type plane and you parachute onto an island filled with weapons with 99 other players.An energy barrier surrounding the island gets smaller and smaller as time goes on and anyone left outside the barrier slowly loses health.Last man/woman standing wins.What is the gameplay like?The gameplay is smoother and straight up better than the arma and H1Z1 versions of battle royale (when you're not experiencing lag more on that later). Looting is pretty exciting since all the loot is designed very well weapons and their attachments all have their strengths and weaknesses and me and my friends already have our different prefrences (so no ""one weapon to rule them all"" bs) The pacing can seem a bit boring for new players (it was for me) though as I learned how to play what to do and what not to do every moment I spent in game felt somewhat exciting and feeling of ""wasting my time waiting for the zone to close in"" disappeared. Every moment felt precious since it could be spent finding better loot getting into a better position and etc.What is the player economy like?Every character earns points during games and with these points they can buy crates which they can open to reveal cosmetic items for their characters to wear.Character customization is relatively simple but some of the items in these crates sell for a nice amount of money.The crates themselves can also be sold.However the dev mentioned that the players would have to pay to open the crates in the future (Update this is now the case) so keep that in mind if you want to buy this to earn some nice steam wallet money.What is the community like?Sometimes there are some really nice people who join you in team games but its mostly bad.Would you recommend this game?I want to recommend this game I really do but I can't.Battle royale is a relatively young genre so its games are obviously going to be a little clunky till the genre fully develops and devs are familiar with its challenges. However calling this game ""clunky"" would be a straight up lie.This game is an absolute travesty of software design it is so bad that it even runs very differently on two machines I own with the exact same components. Running this game is an absolute chore it eats up every last byte of my ram and still asks for more. The frequent crashes lag spikes and frame drops makes this game borderline unplayable. Basically when you buy this game you enter into a lottery if you win your system will run the game properly. If not it won't. I frequently experience lag spikes and frame drops and whenever start a game I have to wait for the buildings to load before I can start looting and sometimes it takes the game ten minutes to load the damn buildings. I've also died several times where the game would literally freeze as I enter a firefight. Oh and the hackers... This game has a bunch.This game could have been amazing if it ran properly. But it doesnt and it probably won't on your machine.Honestly its the best way to play battle royale but only if your system can run it properly.Other than that some of the assets in the game are from the Unreal asset store and not made by the devs which seems a bit dodgy if you ask me.If you're dying to play a great battle royale game (I was and still am) buy this.

This game had it all to be a great game and it was at sometimes and the gunplay is still one of the very best in shooting games. The core concept of the game is good everyone knows about battle royale now and this was the king. Aside from all the weird stuff with Epic Games and Fortnite the truth is that PUBG Corp (Bluehole Software) is running this game into the ground. From overloading the game with micro transactions to not fixing the games' many bugs everytime they patch something they break something they can't handle the problem with the cheaters the optimization is still really poor and finally they bring a season pass for 9.99 for a month of ""missions""( they were bugged to hell) with very little compensation (like skins and clothes many of them temporary). The end result and for me the final ""nail in the coffin"" is the fact that as the player count goes down the time which you spend waiting for the matchmaking goes up a lot. In a game where RNG counts so much and a bad landing can mean you only play for one minute before getting killed having to wait more than 2 minutes for a match to start is a dealbreaker for many people. Maybe when all the AAA titles like CoD and Battlefield come out with their takes on battle royale they'll decide to fix this game...not very likely and probably too late for that. /",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

10/25/2018,0,0,382,FALSE,Not Recommended,Far too much server lag. Iconsitancies with damage caused. Fired a headshot player more or less point blank with a Kar98 and he was wearing a level 1 helmet it didn't one shot kill. Fair enough. However I was wearing a level 2 helmet and level 2 armour was one shotted and died whilst having full health.Also when the game is minimised the in game music still plays. Every first game you play you're stuck at the loading screen and effectively aren't in control of your character until it's too late. Many times in combat the server lag gets you killed.This a just a broken game with INCREDIBLY poor quality control. It's utter abysmal and need a serious overhaul if this game is to become a success in the long run. As it stands it's and has had very little creative input from the developers. Virtually no game modes other than Battle Royale. Also very little maps. Very little weapons and just a general lack of variety makes for inconsistent gameplay and therefore is not enjoyable to play. I think there should be a game mode where you can at least start off with a weapon and have a level playing field. Again quality control is the root of the issue wih this game. It had potential when the game was in beta it had a charm like no other game I had ever played.

10/16/2017,0,0,1,TRUE,Not Recommended,"This game's optimization is by FAR one of the most egregious examples of ""Early Access Syndrome"" with literally every rig having trouble maintaining a stable 60 FPS without a fair deal of tweaks to both in game settings or even config files. It absolutely baffles me how people can continue to support blatant examples of rushed products and cash grabs. This game is fun down in there somewhere amidst some of the worst graphical issues in a triple A game currently. The graphics would look nice if the game would run but the need to basically kneecap the game's settings makes the world look like a poorly textured buggy mess. All of this aside the game is fun but I just don't get why this particular battle royale game is successful. PUBG does nothing new or even particularly interesting in my opinion. This plays very similarly to any other BR game. H1Z1 KOTK The Culling ARK Survival of the Fittest Rust BR Dayz BR all of these games are battle royale games (or include BR modes) and none of them are really all that different IMO. The only BR game in recent memory that stands out (again TO ME) is Fortnite Battle Royale. That game is free for one runs really well for another has the fort building mechanics which add a unique new aspect to a BR game has a more uncommon art style has less of a barrier for entry has quicker matches has fewer bugs and in general seems more creative than these other BR games and PUBG. I don't play BR games much in general but the only one that made me stick around was Fortnite. Anyway I had to refund this after 3 matches. Sadly I just can't deal with all of the graphical problems in this game. Even if this game was cleaned up it still wouldn't be anything new or inspired. I understand why others have fun with it but I don't see how it has earned its undeniable success. This isn't even touching the insanely inappropriate behavior of the devs involving stream snipers and bans as well as the in game ads and extra microtransactions in the Chinese version.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

7/4/2018,0,0,358,FALSE,Not Recommended,Before going further let me inject a little clarification.PUBG can be extremely fun. Obviously it's much more fun with friends but even solo can be immense fun. However this game is probably the best example of a love/hate relationship as can possibly be. Below is my cynical take on the game and what frustrates me the most.Let me give you an accurate portrayal of the PUBG experience.Be in pre game lobby hear prerecorded asian messages played over and over on voice chat drowning out any actual helpful or enjoyable conversations.Be on plane waiting to drop hear top 1990's pop songs being played at maximum volume.Drop onto a roof. Directly on top of a roof. For some reason the game throws you the off the roof and lands you on the side of the building with no door cutting your time to find a weapon down by about 10 seconds.See stash with ammo and a weapon. See enemy player in same room. Rush the weapon stash. Immediately start looting. For some reason the game prioritizes ammo pickups before weapons. Acquire 750 rounds of 55.6 before the game finally realizes you might need a weapon. Finally gives you the weapon. Start loading enemy kills you.Join another lobby. More asian t. You double check the server your on and confirm you are infact on a north american server that's flooded with people that don't speak any english playing a team based game that revolves around communication.Drop from airplane again. Find gun load it sucessfully. Find more gear. So far so good. Find a motorcycle. Start driving. Oh no a pebble in the middle of the road blocks your path. Your motorcycle instantly stops like the hand of god blitch slapped it's and you fly over the handlebars at lightspeed. Die instantly.Join another lobby. Drop from plane. Acquire mad lootz. Make it all the way to the last 10 people standing. You take one or two out now it's just you and one other person. Last enemy suddenly starts spinning around like an ice skater in the olympics and lands 3 direct headshots with a revolver.Congrats you just spent $30 on a broken game from a company that has made hundreds of millions of dollars and locked cosmetics behind an RNG paywall as well as an extra season pass they charge for.TL DR Game at it's core is fun playing with friends can be epic but the thousands of bugs that are still present the lack of a reigon lock and the rampant cheaters murder any kind of fun you almost start to have.EDIT They have removed 2/3rds of all guns in the battle royale modes. Search 20 houses just to get a single gun and maybe 30 rounds of ammo. Meanwhile Sanhok is so populated with guns you get 5 guns and 500 rounds of ammo from each tiny village. Go figure.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

1/4/2018,0,0,1077,FALSE,Not Recommended,"I can't speak for other game modes or elos but as a top 1000 player in TPP (third person perspective) the game is quite unplayable currently. If you make it into the final ten players in this game mode and elo the chance of running into a cheater is incredibly high.I can appreciate the difficulty of catching cheaters. I can. What I can't appreciate though is Brendan Greene's (PLAYERUNKNOWN's) refusual to institute a region lock in the game. There are so many reasons why this should be done none of which have anything to do with the nonsensical ""xenophobic"" accusation he threw out recently. Here are the two best reasons 1. Cheaters. I don't care to delve into hypothesizing why the following information is the case I'm just going to lay it out of all the obvious aimbotters/wallhackers I've identified thanks to the game's replay system (I'd guess at least 15 20 at this point possibly more) I can't recall a single one having a name which I would consider to be of a Western nature. Also every time I checked the stats of a cheater I encountered on op.gg or a similar site I discovered that they played the majority of their games on the Asia server. These facts along with the fact that everyone else who is talking about encountering cheaters has mentioned them being Chinese leads me to believe that the overwhelming majority of cheaters in this game are from China. I don't care why this is the case all I know is that this is indeed the case.If you can't stamp out cheaters which as I said is a task I can appreciate the difficulty of you can at least contain 90% of them to one region by instituting a region lock which is well within your capacity. And judging by the experience I and countless other people have had in the past few weeks this would make a monumental difference in our ability to enjoy the game. We're talking about millions upon millions of players having a much more enjoyable game experience instantly with one simple change.2. The lower the average ping is in the game the more enjoyable the game is for more people. If half of the 100 players in the game have 300ms because they're in China and playing on the NA server that drastically increases the odds of you experiencing something which feels absolutely terrible and ruins your enjoyment of the game. I'm talking about things like getting hit by bullets well after you've gotten behind cover getting hit by someone well before they have even peaked on your screen players warping etc. It is important to point out that in many cases these people are playing on far away servers in order to deliberately take advantage of the aforementioned unfair edges which a high ping grants in this game.I'll update my review if the problem is resolved but currently this issue is making it impossible to enjoy the game at high elo.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

6/27/2018,0,0,612,FALSE,Not Recommended,This game started out as being fun and I have played it for many hours with friends and reluctantly still do as it's still their prefered choice despite its many flaws. However I have grown tired of the lack of optimisations and just plain mistakes the developers appear to make. I am fed up of cheaters and at times just cannot tell is someone is cheating or if its due to the game's poor netcodes where for example I get killed behind cover my end and game cam shows me out in the open is it poor hit detection syncronisation optimisation server issues? I just don't know as I am no expert but I know this is the only game I appear to play inconsistently in. It bugs me when I get killed by other players consistently taking shots at me in a leaned postiion even out in the open and then discovered it's another failed implementation on the part of the developers where leaning gives a player advantages from lack of bullet penetration might as well paint an invisble level 4 vest on it. Then comes the lack of options why so long in map selection for example which is borked (one option is split between two maps at present call that map selection?). I'd like to see game options e.g. selecting servers with a pistol load out when you drop might no be to everyone's taste but that's the point of having selectable options but unless you're some youtuber similar options are just only for a special previliedged few. It would be nice to selct options for event modes instead of having to play them only when the developer allows it. Then comes the QBZ which appears to be the weapon of choice. They have messed about with the weapon tuning so much that unless you get one of the flavours of the month the recoil or just plain poor handling leaves you up the creek without a paddle though the single shot Kar98 knockdown or kill even with a level 3 helmet leaves me puzzled as I have never accomplished this but only with a m24 and I don't think they were wearing level 3 helmets. I have loads of unspent BP because crates are locked behind keys you need to purchase and what's this event pass charging? This is no free to play game and I paid up front. It would be nice for the developers to focus on getting the game properly optimised instead of money grabbing. What started out as a fun game hoping it would improve with updates has remained poor and just appears to evolve into how can we make more money.

I cannot suggest this game to anyone until there are region locks and other factors.Unfortunately this has become a cash cow for the owners because the cheaters get banned and simply purchase another copy of the game and start the cycle over. This keeps a continual revenue stream for the developer. Since they can't cop to that the president pretty much said anyone who believes that region locking should be applied is a racist despite being legitimae lag concerns as well as other benefits.

11/10/2017,1,1,657,TRUE,Not Recommended,When this game came out it had many enjoyable aspects the size of the map random placement of equipment and vehicle the random flight paths and the random finishing location meant no two games would be exactly alike. Unfortunate in recent days the hacking has gotten completely out of hand. In our last match my teammate and I saw several consecutive players taken out by crossbow headshots in a near rapid succession while on a fog map. Then when it was only our team and theirs remaining my teammate and nearly myself as the bolt hit the other side of the wall where my head should have been was quickly dispatched in a similar fashion. It was obvious that we were way out of visual range as I watched them slowly come into view as they came to eliminate me as well.

7/23/2017,0,0,131,FALSE,Not Recommended,Updated Review (June 25th) Here's the deal this game was a gem when it first came out. Now it's an unoptimized clunky mess. The real deal breaker comes from the cosmetic system. It's using the stupid CS GO crate+key system. Not to mention a battle pass ripped from Fortnite Bluehole is suing Fortnite btw and a whole mess of microtransaction cosmetics. Fortnite has more obtainable and transparent cosmetics than PUBG. This game used to be great now it's just an opportunity for the Korean devs to get as much money as they can milk before the game dies. If they remove the key+crate system make the game less clunky and stop with the t 10$ for two skins mess then I might change the review. Recommendation Stay away and play either Fortnite or Realm Royale. If you still want PUBG I highly recommend the mobile PUBG version. Easier to get cosmetics daily quests more gamemodes more fluid controls (Yes the phone has better controls + customization). Just heck this game for now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

11/17/2017,0,0,30,FALSE,Not Recommended,I've been playing PUBG while in Early Access for a few months and now that it's in full release I feel I can write a proper review of the game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a Battle Royale Style Third Person Shooter (Though there IS a First Person mode). Battle Royale Style basically means you're plopped onto a giant map with roughly 94 97 other players with no equipment you have to scavenge for weapons armor and healing items in order to try and survive. You only have one life no respawns and whoever is the last man standing wins. Simple.But therein lies the problem it's last man standing style gameplay and once you're dead you're dead you have to find a new server and start over from the beginning. This is a style I don't find particularly fun and it's a style that's hard to get good at. If you're not a FPS/TPS savant already then you're not really going to have a lot of fun for probably the first 50 100 hours. And if you aren't willing to dedicate a majority of your time into learning the fine details of the game's mechanics then you're never going to get good.The main flaw of PUBG and other Battle Royale Style games is this You can essentially hide in a corner for 99% of the game and win. You can also run around the map only to get picked off by a sniper 30 seconds in. Now of course these games have a gimmick wherein the map becomes increasingly blocked off by something. (In PUBG's case it's a blue forcefield) Constantly limiting your play area and forcing you to move but if you can stay inside the circle and keep hiding staying out of sight then you can end up in the top 5 constantly (And I have by doing just this.)Now PUBG comes with two maps An island map full of foliage and ruins. And a desert map which was released with the 1.0 retail release of the game. The island map has been in the game since the beginning and was a pretty decent map to play on you had plenty of camoflauge and areas to hide from enemies in.The desert map not at all it's large spaces of open area no camoflauge and is basically free reign for anyone with a Kar98 and a 4x scope to pick off other players like fish in a barrel. It's not fun to play at all. But the worst part is that it seems to be the only map in rotation. I played 5 matches and they all came up with the desert map. And all but two times I got picked off while trying to get to a safe zone. Fun times.This wouldn't be a problem if the game actually gave you some indication of where you're getting shot from. No indication means you have no chance to even attempt to hide or fight back. (And before you tell me that the sound of the gunshot is the indication I have surround sound headphones and it's still often hard to determine where shots came from.)So really I find myself getting bored of PUBG after 2 or 3 rounds because it just stops being fun when you spend all this time collecting and gathering equipment and you just get picked off from 500 meters away and then you have to go back to a menu matchmake again and start all over.Now one of the things PUBG was infamous for was it's optimization and while I can't speak for high end users the 1.0 update seems to run much better than it did in Early Access. But I also run the game on low at 720p. So maybe it's just me. But I don't notice the framerate stuttering and drops I used to back in EA. Plus the infamous texture bug is fixed too which is really nice. 1.0 also added the ability to vault over things which makes moving around a hell of a lot easier but the detection is wonky sometimes you just end up hopping in place a couple of times before the game detects there is a wall you can vault and actually vaults over it.In conclusion Should you buy PUBG? Depends. Does the concept of running around collecting equipment for a 1 in 100 chance at winning sound fun to you? If yes then buy it if no then don't. Trust me this Battle Royale stuff is NOT for everyone. Which is why I'm not recommending this game. It is obstensibly not for me I prefer deathmatches when I can at least have a second go if I get killed. But hey I can see why this game appeals to people it's a concept that sounds amazing on paper.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Every game just feels the same and it does get tedious at times. I bought this game shortly after early access and it was fun for a month or two then I neglected it for a couple of weeks. The performance issues of the game is not in good shape. Other reviews could tell you that. But I'm writing this because the game starts to feel more empty everytime I play a few matches. The events are pretty cool and I do like them but there should be more content such as weapons special weapons special vehicles (like the armored truck but something with a turret or like a secret agent vehicle gadget) and smaller maps. Regarding maps I feel like implementing bigger maps isn't necessary anymore. Landing on the outer edges could give good loot but it's the low risk that makes it well boring. I usually land near the center or in Miramar Los Leones and Erangel Military Base but that's because they are popular areas. Those two maps are big and I dont know if it is intented for players not to land near the outer areas but most outer areas are ghost towns with about 1 3 players. Something like Sanhok was a great idea but I hope for future levels the map size is smaller something like 6x6 km. Then in the 8x8 km add more action giving content to make it less empty. Sanhok's size already gets me scared wherever I journey to and that is good. But in Miramar and Erangel it really is just a run and watching simulator. Maybe multiple redzones could be neat just to make it on edge when trying to enter the safe zone. That's just one thing and I don't have any good ideas and it'd be cool to let you guys do that.*Just to explain the events when I do land in populated areas sometimes I don't land there because of lag and frame drops. I mostly drop there just for action or warming up.*Once more action content is added then the name ""Battlegrounds"" will truly take its role.

7/16/2018,0,0,414,FALSE,Not Recommended,Concept of the game is great and reminds of old movie(s). Graphics are very good but could use some optimization in some aspects like trees and their hitboxes. Gameplay is good but could be greatly improved more servers for different regions ( I keep gettings people from Africa and I am EU ) latency check and hitbox fix are urgent vehicle bugs fix ( random flips jumps crashes into nothing 30% of the time) weapon fix and little more balance ( double barrel shotgun doesn't reload if the animation isn't 100% done even if you inserted bullets and closed it but didn't wait additional 0.1 sec for it to finish before swapping to your other weapon). Game as of now has huge problem with loot boxes why do I need to pay real money to unlock it if I paid 30 for the game and paid in game curency for the box you tell me I need to pay $2.50 dollars for the key? Get the f*** out of here! Random connections drops are terrible it often lags you get hit in the head AFTER you dodged it behind a tree and heard a shot 0.5 sec later ( have video proof). Zone location is completely random ( not good because it doesn't take into accound where most people are and some litterally run for 20 minutes chasing the zone just to die from a sniper while they enter the zone in a last second because it was far away and they are very visible because of running). Force everyone to have grass ON because sniping over 100m you can see everyone on the ground if your foliage setting is low even though they think that they are hidden in the grass sucks ). There are plenty of stuff that are good but there is a ton of bugs that aren't getting fixed.... I like this game and play it still but for how long I don't know because it is 70% luck if you win or not. I have video of a game where my team landed in Camp Alpha got good loot then tried going out into the world to fight only to see that zone is coming to us. Final circle ended literally on Camp Alpha we were on roofs with full loot and hp while watching Player Counter going down lower and lower. In the end there were 6 players left 4 of us and 2 enemies. We saw them running to final circle over the hill sniped them easily and without any problem and won the chicked dinner. MOST BORING GAME EVER!!! Win was undeserved and I didn't feel any joy. This was all recorded and will be put on YouTube on my channel with the same name. Do I recommend it in this state yes and no yes if you are willing to wait and hope they fix things and no in the current state that it is you can play it and SOMETIMES it's fun but usually it isn't it's a gamble about anything and winning doesn't go to the most skilled but to luckiest.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Unless you're terrible at this game (low mmr) then you will see a cheater in every single match you play. Of course they're still chinese. Aimbots and no recoil cheats are the most prevelant right now but there have been wallhacks in the last month.If you're a glutton for punishment like I am then get this game somewhere where you can get it for cheaper than the asking price here. If you don't feel like dealing with cheaters while you try to enjoy your game then hard pass this. It is cheat central.Original Review Alright game for being in alpha. Lots of graphical pop in and it looks like something from the 90's even on ULTRA settings. Players can turn down graphical settings to gain an advantage while playing which shouldn't even be a thing. LOTS OF CHEATERS MOST FROM CHINA. This game seriously suffers from non stop cheaters. Speed hacks aimbots wall hacks etcetera. Luckily China's government is talking about banning PUBG so we should see a drastic drop in cheaters across all servers.I recommend this game only on the caveat that you're okay with losing a lot because of cheaters.

Usually my game is crashes!! Even if I installed the game on my SSD! Can't get on the floor without loosing any HP after the patch 1.0... If I shoot a person at the same time but first I die he does not get the shot from me! Driving is horrible physics is horrible If for some reason the reload animation is interrupted the whole weapon must be reloaded! You can't select which map you would like to play.... There is four crates but there are very few chances to get good things. If you get a ""Desperado"" wich has the best clothes you have to buy a key to opan that (great job PUBG Corp) and i ALWAYS getting the same things!! Servers are lagging despite of a reliable and fast internet connectionThat's all if you have strong nerves buy it )EDIT New weapon skins come to have something to buy but normal servers and hitboxes feel it is not important. And the weapon skins are UGLY!! Unnecessary in this game but keep doing it good job again! xDEDIT #2 BRING BACK THAT F#C ING MAP SELECTOR!!Sanhok is unplayable with my PC but any other games runs on max setting but this Sanhok map... I can't play on very low setting because i have 20 60 fps... Great job again )Btw Bluehole... Nice Fortnite event pass copy!Fix ur game first! Check ur rewievs! JUST CHECK THE LAST 3 DAYSREWIEVS!!

11/22/2017,0,0,229,TRUE,Not Recommended,gameplay super fun. The thing is only texture loading bug and some other plenty bugs. The reason i dont recommend this game is because the connection issues. Network lag detected for example. If you face this you'll have to exit to the lobby and reconnect it again which is very annoying. And secondly the servers are always busy. You will get servers being busy. I HATE THIS,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

10/16/2017,0,0,96,TRUE,Not Recommended,this game is praised and i understand it is still in development yet it could be alot better. Very unrewarding and often makes me feel like ive wasted time when playing. You run around scavenging for ten minutes then die or die almost right after landing by a punch to the face while you had shot the person 4 times point blank with a pistol. Outside of games there is no reward system. In game points you get give you lootbox that contains very bland cosmetic items. Imagine if in overwatch there was weekly loot box and everytime you earned a box it got progressively harder to obtain the next until the week was done and the rarity of the items never changed. In duo and squad i can rarely have my team or partner alive or connected past the first minute. PLease dont play solo,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

12/31/2017,0,0,710,FALSE,Not Recommended,Fun game when you're not playing against hackers which is still quite common. The worst part right now is that even though you are on a North American server you get paired with full asian squads that don't speak a lick of English. This makes communication die and ultimately they either kill you or you end up playing solo. Edit While the asian presence has lessened greatly there is still a huge issue with hacking Aimbots recoil nulls GPS bullet hacks speedy run super jump etc.Even though there have been attempts to cull hackers they always find a work around winthin a week and they come back. Bluehole needs to stop messing around with creating new maps making pan skins focusing on cosmetics and they need to optimize what they have and institute a proper anti cheat system.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

PROS beautiful graphic almost realistic but decent execution great to play with friends not clunky animation routine maintenance (even though some of them are just crate / skins updates or daily routine)CONS my god you name it. requires pretty much decent PC bad optimization (fps locked to 144 fps drops and unbalanced no 7.1) no region lock almost 80% of the player doesn't speak english if you play it on Southeast Asia server. this game really requires communication so it's important. cheaters. lots of em. bugs. a lot of bugs. lootbox (basically just betting in a legal way) you can also get the unlocked ones but now there's a lot of chance you'll get locked crates. limitation of how many in game boxes you can buy after the recent updates. battle pass doesn't give you much even though it's actually cost 3/4 price as the game itself basically money grinding developer and they stopped caring after v1.0there's another aspect that i can give about the pros and cons but I just give it straight to the point where it really matters and I have hard time to decide is this game worth it or not but sadly it's not.I get this game for free from my friends but at least I did honest review.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

9/6/2017,0,0,772,FALSE,Not Recommended,"While the game remains fun and very competitive the entire experience is hobbled by HUGE influxes of cheaters/hackers to the point where it's basically unplayable. I understand that it's impossible to rid any game of all hackers and that there's no way to prevent people who want to cheat to win instead of play the game properly. But holy crap when 80% 90% of your games end in a hacker shooting you things are just getting embarrassing. Not only do tens of thousands of people brazenly use aim locking and recoil disabling cheats very liberally with seemingly no punishment whatsoever but the more prevalent form of cheating wall hacks where people can literally see your name and location in game at any time without line of site is not even policed at all by the reporting system in the game. Want to survive in a game? Better hope the person who you're about to fight doesn't have X ray vision and knows your exact location at all times. I feel a lot of people could simply brush off a negative review as ""Oh they just got salty it's not that big of a deal."" But as someone with dozens of wins in the game I'm fine with a loss if the fight that made me lose was fair and competitive. Lately the majority of the matches I play are NOT competitive because it is essentially a coin flip whether any player I encounter has inherent advantages through third party utilities. On top of the pointless updates to the game 6 8 times per day and zero commitment in the past 5 months to do ANYTHING about the massive cheating problem except insistence that ""anti cheat is in the works "" there is no way I can recommend this game anymore. Which is a shame because this was my zone out stress reliever game. Maybe if they make meaningful choices that actually deal with hacking/cheating or release an actual functional anti cheat system that isn't just a promise on a test server I could be lured back. But as so many new games are reiterating the ideas PUBG presented in more unique and interesting ways PUBG has become a hopeless cause.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

When you experience a bug it is usually not just a little thing that you can just ignore and continue playing sometimes you are launched 300m into the air on a bike or trapped on a tiolet forced to watch youself get hit by the zone most of the time its enough to kill you. BUT as much as I hate this game I still play it and still enjoy it. There is alot of potential in this game and now that fortnite and other battle royale game are getting attention it has gave the developers some motivation to start improving the game with patches and new content so hopefully it continues to improve over time and turn into the game we all want. (update) After the latest update this game has become EXTREMELY laggy and buggy.

You actually have to try REALLY hard to make the Unreal Engine perform this bad. If it wasn't for the fact that there is no other Battle Royale game that plays all tacti cool like this game does this game would be mocked as another Early Access catastrophe. There will be die hard fans of this game that will defend it to the death even though Bluehole has never really been a good developer to begin with.

6/22/2018,0,0,756,FALSE,Not Recommended,Alright I know this is a bit late with this. However I have over 600 hours in this game thats right Six Hundred. I have been playing since about a week after early accsess dropped. Ive been through the glitches and the pre Monetisation. This game in short is fun in spurts. With every patch and update something seems to be geting worse about it. Wanted to get a crate that is free to open you have a 10% chance each week. There is no bad luck safety block on this either so you can end up spending all your BP and not get a single crate that is free to open. Then there is the BP earning and spending. Only thing to do that seems to be a sense of progression is getting BP for placeing high or wining plus getting kills also vets you a small amount of BP. If you win you get a bigger chunk. But even with a win most of the time your not going to get much more then 800 BP. Which is enough for the first box of the week thats it. The earning of this in game currency needs work. It needs balanced. With the most recent patch i see more and more availability for a mission system and lvling up your account. Although there is a catch you have to pay to unlock more missions and to unlock specail stuff. In most cases this would not bother me. However you get to do 3 missions a day for very little xp towards your lvl if you do not want to pay. This is PUBG trying to get the most out of their dieing player base. Player Unknown himself has unfortunetly lost his connection with his players and his audience of gamers. Your streamers are only a small amount of people that play your game sir. So please get back to your roots and offer a better option to those who do not want to pay to have the ability to customize a bit more. You wonder why the PUBG steam market place is flooded with hoodies and rare items that people are selling because its so rare that a normal player isnt getting them or if they do they know its big money. Your streamers that you pay to keep eyes on your game are even shifting away slowly. Pay is a strong verbage. You give free gifts and such to entise the gamer to keep streaming your game. However I digress. Besides my Hatered for pay to enjoy games and such this game has been going down hill. The amount of hackers that PUBG themselves have admitted play the game alone should be alarming. If you do not have a strong connection kiss early game goodbye. Things in this game simply need to get tightened up. Enjoy at your own risk. I will continue to play now and then if my friends are on and we want to go do somthing but other than that i refuse to play alone on this game now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

This game early on used to be a haven for my firends and I to relax and have a good time playing a competative multiplayer game together. Unfortunatly the only thing that has progressed in this game is the amount of hackers present. These no recoil hacks have gotten way out of control and the develper is complaicent with trying to fix the issues. Don't waste your time and money on this game until Bluehole figures out how to protect their products and their playerbase which doesnt seem to be anytime soon.

Hackers have destroyed the game and there seems to be no steps in fixing the issues. Now you can die by a very good player at the game and die thinking it was a hacker because there are so many hackers in the game that is the conclusion you jump to. I'm very disapointed in what the game is becoming and for the invasion of the chinese players. Squads used to be a place where you could join solo and make new friends who you could communicate with. Now NA servers are just a home for non english speaking players so trying to make friends in random games doesnt happen anymore. They need to fix the hacking region lock the servers and maybe the game will last.. all i know is my friends and I aren't playing much since the hackers and the lack of communication with teamates ruined the server..,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I've been playing since shortly after it released and it's been fun to watch it improve. 1.0 is going to be great.EDIT Going to start off by saying that this game really captivated me and gave my friends and I a really great outlet to connect and have fun. I REALLY love this game at its core. However I can not accept the decision made by ""Blue Hole"" to lock loyal and paid players behind a paywall. It seems they jumped on the Fortnite bandwagon (albeit after an embarassing lawsuit attempt...) and are now charging in real time without any testing of viability the idea of paid content passes. You can flame me for saying such a thing but this is my view point.I supported this game from nearly day one. My friends shortly followed. We gave hundreds of hours of our time (AND ACTUALLY FILLED OUT BUG REPORTS) to improve this game. And in response the Devs/Company decided to paywall all of us on top of our current frustrations with a lack of real support. No compensation whatsoever. I applaud the Developers and this company as a whole for giving us many new weapons along this journey. The love is felt and it really did improve the game. It seems to just be a mask now though. A stale desert map and some clusterjunk island map will not justify a reason to pay for any sort of content pass when you STRICTLY engineer unlocks to only be accessed by paying a sum of money.It seems as though the only priority of this company is cash flow. Perhaps the original sales money of this game was squandered I really hope that changes before it's too late. This game set records. IT SET RECORDS all time records. The player drop off isn't because of Fortnight or any other BR games it is a result of the haphazard way in which the game is being dealt with. It's just my two cents. I love this game but it's in real trouble. The statistics all prove it. P.S. I didn't say anything abou tthe hacking it's prevalent and it ruins entire games.

5/31/2018,0,0,12,FALSE,Not Recommended,Product received for free. Do you like chinese hackers running for hours only to get killed in 3 seconds playing with friends only to run or drive for long periods of time only to die by one squad who has been camping for 40 mins? Well this gamemode is for you (honestly a gamemode not even a full game).So I wanted to like this game but it's honestly bad. The maps are so large you will probably spend 80% of your gameplay running hoping to get in the circle. 15% of the time you are inside the circle so you are camping waiting to ambush other players running into the circle. And 5% of the time actually engaging in the circle. Unless you jump out and try and follow a group. Then you'll most likely engage 80% of the time and either you die quickly or end up repeating the previous process. That being said there is really no huge motivation for winning a game other than patting yourself on the back and getting a free tshirt the first time you win (in game). There are lootboxes which are pretty much their way of saying hey buy cosmetics or play for many many hours to unlock a free box. Beyond this there is no level progression or incentives to keep playing the same kind of game mode over and over. Ultimately you are paying for a single game mode with very limited number of maps (and while they are quite large they are pretty empty outside of settlements) no real progression or incentive to keep playing and you will be very bored very often if you are trying to win.I had a very boring and frustrating experience with this game please save your money for better games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

One word of advice if you need as least half decent developers post your developing positions on University of Waterloo for CS program.

6/25/2018,0,0,230,FALSE,Not Recommended,This game is fun I enjoy it immensely they update it frequently the gameplay is solid graphics are good etc.. however the problem is that you pay $30 for the game and you're punished for not paying more. I could understand battle pass style microtransactions for a game that's initially F2P but having bought the game and having to pay an additional $120 a year for their BS Battlepass to make the game actually fun and implement some form of progression is complete crap. I understand that it's all about vanity items and that's not my problem. Not being able to collect completed missions and achievements that are in game is a serious issue. If you're like me a game can be decent but have a great progression system and you'll keep playing it. PUBG has a cool mission system challanging and fun while also giving you that feeling of accomplishment for completing a mission. However what is not fun is that it's hidden behind a $10 a month pay wall. I don't have a problem paying the $10 money is not the issue. It's the principle of the matter. You have fans that pay your $30 asking price and you expect to gouge them more for an additional $10 a month for features of a game that should be free for those who actually paid for it in the first place. This isn't even touching on the merger of the battle crates that force you to spend your BP on the possibility of getting a new item from a keyless crate while incorporating the inability to choose whether or not you get a premium crate which requires you to pay $2.50 to open it. So in essence you can play your off to accumulate 4200+ BP for the third crate in the unlock line and you're going to end up having to pay to open it after playing for a day or two to make that kind of BP because lets be honest 99% of you don't win frequently just as I don't. Before the forced merger the items weren't flooded on the market and it was a fair way to do things. However when you force your community to receive your stupid premium key crates and extinguish their ability to bypass them this is cramming your micro transaction system down their throat and shows us the people who do pay your bills for you that we do not matter in the least. Your game has netted you millions probably tens of by now this is greed. This is also shady as hell and a blatant slap in the face to your community. Greed is the downfall of anything that succumbs to it. I enjoy the game but things need to change because they're making AAA moves as a B class developer There's a reason why Indies are gaining ground and it's because the AAA industry is about making money in the most grotesque ways possible and not about it's players who got them to where they are. BlueHole right this issue or you're going to be standing alone. We are not cattle we are the reason you're popular and we will be the reason why you are no longer. I enjoy your product but you've made a huge mistake by hiding basic features behind a pay wall. You're not a AAA developer and you're not a F2P game that requires mass revinue to upkeep it's servers. The volountary Micro transactions I'm sure were far more than enough and what you make from your inital sale price should have netted you far more than enough for anyone to live comfortabally for half of a life time. Stop cramming your crappy schemes down people's throats show respect for the people who support you and be human beings... EDIT This snippett is taking place after realizing a few things that are even more shady. Namely you get one Mission per week as a non battlepass holder. Limited to 80 EXP a day towards your level and if that weren't bad enough here's the clencher. The Items you bust your bum obtaining other than 3 (two of which are out of reach completely ) are on a 30 day timer. Meaning that no matter how much you work to level and earn the items by leveling to a high free level due to their BS restrictions to Non Battlepass subscribers they disappear after 30 days at best. Just thought I'd toss this out there. Shady.. Just Shady and wrong. TLDR In essence I do not in any way reccommend giving your money to this greedy developer there are far too many Free to Play alternatives that will cost you far less in the long run. A fact that I hope they realize before they collapse. Prior to the mandatory participation in their Microtransaction system I would have recommended this game to anyone and I still would if this was righted however hiding progression of any form behing a pay wall is just dirty and removes any recommendation I would ever give.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They'll try polishing it up over about 2 years but the final release will never come if it does it will still be lackluster compared to any real developer created FPS game. That being said if it was around 15 dollars it would be worth the purchase just to see what facing 100 players crapping around one map feels like. It was hard the first 10 hours getting used to it kind of fun for about 20 hours and then when you realize how horribly balanced it is you just start to spend more time playing other games because this one pisses you off. I will say that the only fun part is the first few times you get to the last 10 or so people because you get that adrenaline rush from being so close to the top and the tension is real.

Fast forward 15 months... The game couldn't be in a more awful state. The game's netcode is still atrocious I still have to deal with putting a mag in a dude and he takes it like it was nothing its awful. Also the optimization is still terrible. Erengal is alright but still pretty bad but the other two maps run awful for me. especially Sanhok that map has been delayed multiple times and it still runs horribly. The amount of glitches in the game is still awful as well glitching through walls dying from falling out of the map weird broken physics with cars it doesnt even look fixed and the game also crashes sometimes which is annoying.

I enjoyed and 'played' through the performance issues of the game a lot but there gets a point where it's too much.As of this current update (22.2.18) with the new spring cases ect the game feels unplayable. Jitters it's really terrible. Myself and my friends played one round and quit afterwards and went to other games.I think it's great that games in alpha/beta are able to get to certain points to welcome a big community and become playable games but in pubg there remains an issue that the game still requires many updates impacting performance. It saddens me. PUBG I hope you're doing the best you can. Use more money on resources to optimise the game smash the bugs make the game polished. Otherwise I guarantee you will see more people going to Fortnite why? Because it's optimised.I recommend this game only to those who are patient enough to deal with regular updates that can affect the quality of gameplay you have. It's heavy on hardware (I have a 1080ti atm from 75 60) and those things alone can be quite frustrating. Otherwise the game is fun. I'm sorry but I'm going to have to give a downvote at this point in time.Regards.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

One of the major reasons I say this Since I've bought it their server's are generally down/full.How can you play a game that's whole basis is multiplayer and there are no servers to play on?

Sure it's only cosmetic so I don't really care all that much about the monetization methods but it still sucks that so many games now have lost the fun of customization. I think most people are overreacting a little. You can dislike this 10 dollar pass without acting like the devs have literally in your mouth. I really enjoyed the Event mode where we would get things like 8 man squad shotguns only where everyone is driving around in trucks ramming each other etc. but they seem to come and go before I even get to experience these modes. And nowadays they seem to only be doing War mode for events which I might as well be playing Call of Duty or something if I'm going to waste my time with that boring mode. I haven't even bothered to check out the new map yet. Meh. I hope for the best for PUBG's future but not expecting much from these devs at this point.

Price almost 30e and Bluehole still struggles (it's December!) with lag and other improvements. Where has all that money gone? ! ? They have either superslow coders or it's the lack of their skills. Or both. Realism / There is no realism. Handguns are useless ((dont use them at all try cast iron pan )) yeah like shooting someone with 9mm from 10 meters do less damage than a F****** iron pan. Yeah...Same goes to other guns and bullets you have to empty a full clip of M4 on players feet to only see how he/she makes a perfect headshot afterwards and kills you. Yeah... Graphics environment / Graphics are the same as games had 5 years ago. It's ok for a multiplayer like this. Nothing new. Environment is not that special. It's kind of a dull. As a part of mentioned realism you should only play FPS version. Personally I cant understand whats the point of seeing behind every ing corner just by moving your mouse even though your character is safely behind every wall and obstacle. 3rd person mode should be banned. It's cheating and cuts realism. Conclusion / This game is not for pc. It's perfectly made for ps or xbox. As we all know console games have always been ""Less"" than pc games.

Lets start with the hot topic of cheaters they are everywhere and its rare to get a game without them. Bullet detection is absolute garbage and even worse at distance. This is down to them using 32 tick servers which is pathetic and atrocious netcode. The Circle sytem is also bad and most of the time its either in the centre of the map or right at the edge with most of it in the sea and I garuntee you will spend most of your game chasing the circle. The loot distribution really needs to be looked at I love dropping in to an area and finding no gun whatsoever in a battle royal game. Maybe increase spawn points of M16 and AKM might fix it but very rare do I drop into a high pop area and find a gun so whats the point in playing if your just gonna get shot with only a smoke grenade to defend yourself. Also the devs seem really touchy at the moment as I got banned from the general discussion on steam for spamming after posting 1 single comment. Now I will say as bad as the game is at the moment I have really enjoyed my experiences and won numerous chicken dinners which is a glorious feeling. But as it stands the bad outways the good for me and will be interesting to see how the devs handle this going forward.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No reigion lock and bad ping abuse lead to players seeing you and shoting you head off before you even see them leading to instant one taps when you finally see them. The reigion lock also allows people from countries where hacks are massively used and (cough the chinese company that bought part of the game and sells hacks out the back.)unregulated .

Thing that is sad is that I had over 440 hours on this game and never cheated once and their failed system to even dispute a ban is astonishing. I understand pubg has a problem with cheaters in general but their system needs to verify its an actual cheat before a ban is applied. Or at least give us an opportunity to appeal I have a game ban on my account now for something I did not do. That game ban has caused issues for me in many of my gaming communities I am in.

I do enjoy the game but if you are thinking about buying this game i simply cannot recommend it at this point in time until this issue gets fixed It is literally a rare thing to get paired with someone from NA or someone who actually speaks english. im assuming everyone from NA got annoyed with it and just stopped playing this game completely or the servers got completely invaded.

Buggy movement The mid game is absolutely dead and boring because of a recent change which means that you can't travel as far as you could do prior to the change from the flight path. Terrible collision e.g. (this is my video) https //www.youtube.com/watch?v cSq9C2NolxA Cheaters note that China represents 40 50% of the playerbase but 60% of banned cheaters are Chinese and over 90% of cheats come out of China Playing with Chinese players regardless if you queue NA/EU/SA/OCE servers Disgusting amount of desync getting shot around the corner because of a combination of horrible netcode and high ping players (cough Chinese) More often than not having multiple houses consist of mainly clothes as loot (and it has shown sometimes guns load in slower than clothes) Being shoved the new map (and previous to that the appalling weather modes) down your throat with no option of selecting what you want to play (the only option at the moment is to leave during the pre flight lobby) Desert map being horrendously bad too big too many open fields and loot being questionable at best. They're trying to rectify this disaster of a map by adding in better loot and more buildings IIRC. Disastrous and legitimately dangerous sound balancing. The plane noise is horrendously loud when grenades are thrown close to windows that you are close to (and when the redzone blows up windows close to you) e.g. https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 1cjMI00BP7A A notoriously bad Korean dev studio who were the developers of Tera (and we all know how that one panned out) who are obnoxiously not transparent with what they're """"""""""working"""""""""" on. The same bugs and problems have been prevalent since long before this ""official launch"" when the game could still be considered barely in a beta state. Refusal to acknowledge the problem the Chinese players are presenting to other regions even Brendan Greene calling western players Xenophobic because we do not want to play with the Chinese due to the points listed before. The only hope left is Tencent launching their own server and blocking off the Chinese from playing on the international servers. This is one of the more extreme videos showcasing how toxic the Chinese community is to PUBG https //www.youtube.com/watch?v woBcpSURKgcThen this is the game for youFinal notes Do not fall for the shilling thats on places like the PUBG subreddit who exclaim such stuff like ""they'll make this game better just give them time to polish it out"" it's almost been 2 months since ""official release"" and like 9 months of EA prior to that and they still havent attempted to fix any of the core problems related to networking.But hey atleast the gunplay is pretty good and rewarding for outplaying people and they managed to release one dare I say decent patch which significantly increased fps and added in vaulting which was like 4 months overdue since the time of release.Atleast I made my steam dollar back from this game by selling crates (when they said they weren't going to add in loot boxes during early access nice one btw)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

12/10/2017,2,1,240,TRUE,Not Recommended,Long story short this is not a good game. It's not fun. It is not enjoyable. It is poorly designed damage to other players is not consistent (or high enough at its best to begin with ) cheaters run rampant and there are more bugs than I could even begin to describe. The idea of a good battle royale game is great I love the genre. But PlayerUnknown needs to revamp bullet mechanics and damage coding because they suck. Plain and simple. I would not recommend ANYONE to buy this game as it is right now. I regret ever spending $30 on it. I've played over 200 hours with my friends TRYING to enjoy this game because I really want to. But after playing other games that did this genre correctly such as ArmA I just cannot bring myself to think it's good. It is in alpha yes of course. However the direction the game is heading is just bad. Focus on making damage make sense before you start worrying about creating new vehicles and weapons. Focus on controlling cheaters before you start worrying about making new boxes with clothes in them. Seriously? You can be one shot by a jumping punch from another player 100 times in a row but then you go and SuperMan punch someone in the back of the head then punch them in the face four more times and they proceed to shoot you and kill you. It's frustrating when you expect the game to be functioning and have working damage registration like other games in the genre. But for now it'll continue to be on my uninstalled list. I would give this game a 2/10 for its graphics and attention to detail. That's about it. Fortnite a free to play game does it better than a game with hundreds of millions of dollars behind it.

I would recommend you to read some of neutral reviews from real people who are not streamers and youtubers and who have brains and dignity left those people count and if you really set on buying this game then get ready for everything writen above I sincerely cannot recommend this game not matter what others say or show you on mainstream media fake t videos and streams.

So now we have a years worth of band aid fixes that try to hide the still core problem in the game. I have over 1 000 hours in the game across two accounts but the replay value and longevity went away with the updates. Too much of the game is mixed with 1/3rd wtf moments? Glitches or rare moments 1/3rd Game broken Main menu troubleshooting or Server instability with another 1/3rd of intense moments that can be fun or exciting. So take 2/3 of the game being emotionally draining and add 1 000 hours. You get someone who gets burnt out. I feel most people that are still playing are people who haven't given the game a try during alpha who don't play it enough to feel they've got their moneys worth.

Random crashes mid game Sometimes game won't even load you into the lobby then what do you need to do is to kill the process of this game in the task manager and start it again this time hoping it'll load... if it won't then well.. repeat till it does. No region locks literally EU and NA servers are overwhelmed by asian people being thousands of miles away yet deciding to play on EU and NA servers so they can have horrendous ping so they can use it to their advantage killing you when you're managed to hide behind an obstacle hours ago.

Sometimes even down to 15 30 Game creator Brendan Greene calling people racist and xenophobic just because they want china region locked. Guys let's be serious here we just want to play normally with people who doesn't lag across the map because their ping is above 600 we don't want being eradicated by chinese hacker in every freakin' game...wouldn't this game be really good and everything went back to normal after china's been regionlocked? it would not because in steps mr greedy.. oh sorry mr. greene calling you racist and xenophobic just so he can earn more money by sporadically banning too obvious cheaters so they can buy this game on another account and start cheating again.I deeply regret giving him my money because he doesn't deserve it.

The lack of polish throughout the game beginning with the main menu is just really dissapointing this far into release. Honestly the game feels like an unfinished mod.It's too bad because I prefer this style of gameplay to something like Fortnite I've never thought the building in that game was very fun but at this point Fortnite is the BR that i'm playing because it's so much more complete and the developer is so much more responsive to changes in the player base. I mean Fortnite is like 60 FPS on consoles has fun events and progression different modes of playing with different levels of intensity other than my feelings on the building aspect it's just a much more solid game.. also it's freeIt's really dissapointing if you wanted PUBG to end up good because right now it looks like they've missed the boat and won't get the players back on board.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

I make top 10 every time won a few. I get killed by a hacker in 2 out of 3 games I play. It's pretty blatent and obvious and theres nothing you can do about it. China and Korea promote hacking in computer games and bluehole does not have a legitmate campain to stop the problem at the source. Gaming lounges there advertise that they provide the latest hacks and its all a money making circle. Ban players sell more copies. If you can deal with that buy it. Great game the only game I've ever seen real world combat tactics in a survival environment actually work and payoff everytime. Stay low use cover and concealment stay quiet cover your tracks engage only when you know you will kill don't give away your position always try to live to fight another day keep your 6 clear use surpressive fire use terrain to your advantage don't get pinned and you'll make take top 10 everytime.

From the atrocious networking and hit detection to the pitiful optimization it is pretty clear why PUBG Corp. appears to be in full damage control mode. Rather than fix what is already in the game the team focuses of introducing new flashy features long before they are ready for release (see moving building geometry without moving loot spawns).Even after all this time there are still core game breaking bugs that persist unfixed. These include late loot spawns (loot spawning in after people have landed) vehicle physics glitching out and killing people to world geometry not having collisions to buildings straight up not loading in. Rather than try to fix these bugs PUBG Corp have been persuing lawsuits for ideas they didn't invent or for items that are not unique to the game.Every day the game seems to prove that there are more bugs than working features in the game but PUBG Corps' got their money so they're focusing on what more microtransactions they can pull from this full priced game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

From rampant issues with trying to connect to servers being kicked off the server and unable to connect the game refusing to load and being unable to interact with allies if you manage to rejoin. Worse yet is the cheating. BattleEye sources say as also qouted by the Dev Brendan Green that 99% of the cheating comes from China which is 47% of every single player in the world. The cheating like shooting through walls teleporting insane speeds no recoil instant lockon all these things make the experience just ruined. It's only worsened by players who cannot physically communicate with you because they do not speak the native language of the regions' servers they chose to connect to. In a game where teamwork and communication literally decide the outcome of a game where seconds count this is Terrible. Almost as terrible as the PING connections as it takes several seconds for the data to travel around the world to reach those NA servers precious several seconds that effectively don't happen in a Reflex and Percision based FPS where entire fights could only last 5 seconds. When half of that time all that data just disappears and hasn't reached the player yet it can effectively make a player you kill still be alive for long enough to kill you. The game is good very good. But the player base is toxic and riddled with server problems cheats and bad connections. Rather than fix it for gameplay reasons the Dev called all players in the west upset with this Xenophobes. For that alone I would recommend against it as well. Do not buy this game. Not until servers are fixed and the dev sees you as something other than a racist for wanting solid servers and a fair game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

11/13/2017,0,0,287,TRUE,Not Recommended,This game has the potential to be so good but it has some extremely frustrating flaws that hold it back. Bluehole has more than enough resources to improve this game at a much greater rate than it has been so far so why its still in its current state is a little concerning. They are still claiming a full release by the end of Q4 but I don't think thats going to happen. My biggest issues with this game are as follows 1) As of 11/13/17 the amount of hackers/cheaters in this game make it unplayable. Spending 20 or 30 minutes in a game only to be shot and eliniated in a matter of a few seconds by someone from across the map is unacceptable. It's always being shot through walls from impossible diatances with full auto weapons or some other form of cheating. Its almost every game now something like this happens and yet Bluehole claims their anti cheating measures have been ramped up and they're banning more people than ever. 2) The amount of bugs in a game a month away from full release is crazy. Crash to desktop stuck in walls/doors parachute getting stuck weapons not firing when commanded not able to scope in etc. I don't mind bugs here and there its impossible to have a perfect game but sometimes the game become almost unplayable. 3) The optimization of the graphics is not good. With some of the most recent updates my frame rates took a big dive. With my set up (1080Ti &amp 7700K) I don't think I should be running mid 20's FPS at some points of the game. Alot of textures still look really bad seizure inducting texture clipping on some walls. I don't know a whole lot about tech but wtf. 4) Servers are always lagging. You think you made in behind cover in time only to be killed behind a wall or something. Why am I always in lobbies full of Chinese people? I don't mind them they seem like perfectly pleasant people but how can their ping be relative to mine? I know this has to affect the game play in some form or another. 5) Advertising in game is shameful. Are you that greedy for cash that you need to graffiti walls with a sponsors logo/information? I know it seems like a petty gripe but where does it end? Our whole world is advertisements being crammed down our throats now its leeching its way into games. And the paids crates. I suppose the paid crates aren't a big deal as long as they're purely non game changing cosmetic items. But putting paid crates in a beta seems a bit like a cash grab. PUBG is alot of fun sometimes but at this point the flaws are game breaking. I hope they make some changes at Bluehole and get this back on the right track again. Maybe future updates will give this game the help it needs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

They had enough time and enough ressources to fix almost everything I.G.

However all of those problems are common in this game. Their methods of blocking cheaters was alright until they started blocking ReShade among other ridiculous measures. Not to mention that the aforementioned streamer supremacy is extremely common Twitch streamers just out right get priority over people who don't stream. In all honesty if you want uber realistic gunplay don't look here play the Arma 3 mod that started it all. If you want simple gameplay that is actually interesting even when you're not in a gunfight play Fortnite. There's absolutely no need to take a second look at PUBG in my opinion seeing as Fortnite is excellent and free plus Arma 3 is 10.99 on sale not to mention all the other things you can do in it. There's also Just Cause 3 Battle Royale which despite an almost complete lack of players is actually quite enjoyable.NEW Cuisine Royale's out now and I'm blown away by how much better it is than PUBG despite being an April Fools' joke and a free game (at the time of writing).

8/15/2017,0,0,0,TRUE,Not Recommended,I know they run on different engines but when games like Metal Gear Solid 5 run on high graphics flawlessly with almost no frame drops on my system I find it intensely unsatisfying that a game like PUBG suffers from massive frame drops with textures failing to load and unbearably long loadtimes that are so long that by the time I get into the game the airplane is already halfway across the map I have to question why this game has the balls to even do a crate/key microtransaction system.In my opinion the most important part of a multiplayer experience is optimization and compatibility. Games like Overwatch Rainbow 6 Counter Strike they are all amazingly compatible with a multitude of systems. When people play games with a competitive nature the last thing they want to worry about is falling through the building when the building they were attempting to land on failed to load in time.And before you ask yes I am intending on eventually upgrading my computer's graphics card amongst other things but it isn't currently on my top list of priorities. I heard a lot of good things about PUBG a lot of my favourite Youtubers have played it and it looks very enjoyable when it runs right. I was fortunate enough to have a halfway decent match in this game before I decided it was not woth it right now.

But your use of the best engine ever is poor.UpdatesImagine if Facebook pushed out an update that gives users more games allows them to change profile colours etc. But in the meantime it ruins the whole platform on how poorly it's made overloads the servers and makes the platform unusable.

It's so badly made it's incredible. Such low level optimization crap mechanics and slow characters I haven't seen yet.

One of the best engines if not the best EVER made.

PUBG and Fortnite were both built on Unreal Engine 4 yet Fortnite has superior optimization and performance while PUBG has literally none. Just make a good use of it otherwise what's the point of using Unreal Engine 4 since the game performs like made in Unity free edition.PROS Fun to play on a super high end PC due to crap optimizationCONS Everything related to optimization resource usage servers back end &amp front end developmentIf you need any help in making the thing work contact me.

However the last month has been filled with drama and politics from the developers. They went back on their promise to not introduce microtransactions until final release. This part doesn't bother me so much but what does bother me is that the way the crate system is going to work you spend $2.50 per key to unlock a crate which has a random PIECE of a set. So you might get a shirt or shoes or whatever which feels too much like they're nickle and diming the playerbase. Furthermore items from these crates that you have to buy keys for are real money exclusive as in you cannot aquire them unless you spend real money.More importantly though is the devs are extremely ban happy and there are instances where players have been banned for killing twitch streamers who then claim they're stream sniping. No actual evidence or anything the streamer just claims the person that just killed them is stream sniping and then all their followers mass report the person (which is a community problem) and the devs greenlight the ban. Heck even if you speak out against the game on forums or discord you'll get banned from those without batting an eye.I really want this game to do good but as it stands the actions of the devs and the community are both pointing towards a disasterous tailspin.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

10/24/2017,0,0,4,TRUE,Not Recommended,The premise is simple You maybe your friends and some other players are air dropped into a island city filled with weapons and items. The goal is to kill eachother. there's a lot of luck involved in this game and that's the main thing that I found frustrating maybe if there was a smaller scale I'd find more enjoyment from the game. I purchased the game becuase I felt left out it sucked in all my friends and siblings not understanding why I purchased the game hoping maybe I'd enjoy it. Unfourtenetly it's buggy not very polished considering the size of the player base and it's another game that sadly makes shotguns really bad like Cod. ( As a side note shotguns are not as inaccurate as this game would lead one to believe especially with the proper choke. ) I will continue to play this game simply becuase my friends play it however I find it increadibly frustrating becuase of all the variables that can determine if you win or die a quick death that means nothing. There's no real reason or feeling of progression or achievment. If I wanted to play a pointless slaughter house I'd play quake or UT4 ( UT4 is free on the epic games launcher). If you want something like the hunger games on a larger scale this game is for you. However I cannot say I found it to be a fun expierence.

1/31/2018,0,0,283,FALSE,Not Recommended,"It's both a fun game and cool concept for a game. It has balance issues optimazation issues and bugs a great amount of them. Things I can accept in early access not in a full release.I still cannot see my friends on my friendslist in a lobby. So if my one friend who actually detects me is offline we can't play together. Which is pathetic for a full release. Speaking of pathetic HIT DETECTION.But that is just the start of the issues with this game.They are lazy greedy and on some level incompetant.Why? We already paid to get into the early access. But PAID LOOTBOXES before the game was even done. Just had to claw at that juicy juicy gamer wallet. And now that the game is done PAY FOR KEYS for the lootboxes you earn in the game. Why? Because paying for the game iself just doesn't bring in the big bucks for the company. Their optimazation before release. Horrible servers in China resulting in Chinese players invading US servers ruining a great deal of matches for the US players because they keep getting teamkilled for not speaking Chinese. The Chinese players ping also create issues which the PUBG team simply are too lazy to address with anything but ""STOP BEING RACIST FOR BRINGING UP LEGIT ISSUES."" When you shoot a chinese player in the head with a shotgun six times while they are sitting still only to watch them not die turn around and shoot you in the face killing you the issue should be addressed.Not to mention the issue with the massive amounts of cheaters coming from China. BattleEye has the numbers on this. 99% of the cheaters come from China according to BattleEye itself. (Look it up). And Brendan Greene (creator of the game) is not concerned with this stating people in China have a different mentality about cheating. (Which makes it OK I guess). They are pathetically partial to streamers. (Because they bring advertising thus money). The majority of players don't stream so they don't matter as much.If you critizise the issues with PUBG odds are Brendan Greene will call you racist xenophobic or some variation of that without addressing the criticism. He does not care about the people who supported his work or were happy to see him succeed. He has become greedy political and lazy.Stay savvy about your developers.

2/21/2018,0,0,252,FALSE,Not Recommended,lets start off Pubg is an intense fun battle royal game it has a good variety of guns and and tools to use at yur dispoisal that can make for a fun time with friends. Aswell as the crates you can be awarded sell on the steam market for a pretty penny. But thats where the Good parts End and the reasons on why I would not recommend Pubg or Plunkbat. Pubg servers suffer from constant connection issues and laggy portions. On top of that you will more often then not get the specific map you hate 9 games out of 10. I think the worst part though is the blatent hacking that runs rampant in pubg. Dieing in this type of game can be rather rage inducing especally because alot of the time it is due to your own poor decisions but one thing that is more rage inducing is dying to someone who is clearly hacking. More than 90% of hackers come from china according to battleeyes own reports on the subject and although these problems have been brought up to Brenden Green he has refused to do anything about it. To add insult to injurys is not only are these Chinese players hacking but they are joining North American Servers Causing a mass Ping issue which practically makes them time travalers on top of the hack yet Brenden Green refuses to region lock China choosing instead to call his american player base Xenophobes for not wanting to play with Laggy Chinese Hackers.

6/21/2018,0,0,260,FALSE,Not Recommended,I would not recommend this game in its current state. I used to play this game a lot with my friends (it's one of my top 10 most played on Steam) but now it just sits in my library occassionally downloading an update every couple of weeks or so. I went from playing about 25 35+ full games a week (each game being roughly 20 30 minutes) about 6 months ago to only playing 2 games in the last 2 months. The same problems that plagued it almost a year ago when I got it in early access (optimization and bugs) are still there. The new weapons cosmetics attachments etc. are not enticing enough to bring me back to this game which I had so much hope for.Despite being taken out of Early Access almost half a year ago it still is as poorly optimized and bug filled as when I bought it a year ago. For every bug that is fixed there is a new one that takes its place in the next update. Vehicles are where the bugs are most prominent but I have also experienced problems with the buildings not loading in on time and my character model getting stuck inside a wall.If I want a somewhat decent performance out of the game I need to play it on low or medium settings to get 45 60 fps however this is on the same computer that can run the Witcher 3 on Ultra and Battlefield 1 on High settings and still manage 55 60 fps while looking much more visually pleasing. There has not been one update in the last year that has made any significant improvement to optimization in this game.All while this is happening they are pushing out new cosmetics new weapons and new attachments changing the meta. Which by itself isn't a problem. The problem is that they are doing this while ignoring some of the longest running and most prominent problems of the games. I get the argument that an art team is different than a game design team but PUBG has made literally hundreds of millions of dollars. There is no reason why they can't higher more people and get them up to speed to fix things. If it's an issue of wanting to make money there's a lot more money to be made off of a game that has a strong and stable player base over many years than trying to milk all of the money you can out of a dying player base. Just take a look at Rainbow Six Siege and League of Legends for examples.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

And real game is the least suitable place to test controls due to it's dynamic nature not to mention it takes time to enter and reenter. You will spend 10x time to merely grasp basic things about your controls comparing to most other games... Controls setup menus etc. it is a simple basic things and it is broken...

OR LIKE MANY PLAYERS ASK'd was instead of banning players take all the reviews of actual cheaters reported and just put them in their own sever. that way they didnt know they got banned and just constantly just match up with eachother. once the whole cheating thing gets fixed it will be an excellent game. ive come to the point i dread on even coming on thinking Damn i wonder if i will die by a cheater or not. its a mentality. thank god XBOX isnt suffering like we are at least.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

No loot or sometimes the same package of loot same room (like 2 times lvl1 bag with lvl2 vest). Most cases the rooms are completely empty. Honestly.The houses? Bad joke again! Looks like noone lived there ever. Cities should look like abandond cities but the houses were just created by 2nd grade devs. Show me a flat which has 3 balconies and every balcony has 2 entrances. Ridicuolus!!!Laggy like hell. really You simply cant go into a room because drops you back 10 times.I have 270 hours in the early access. At the end it was almost perfect. The community cries back the old map which comes almost never in the line which should be AT LEAST RANDOM or maybe possible to choose.Really.Developers insert the option and the possibility to choose between maps and you'll see NOONE will play on this id*iot new desert one.

They're a new fad like survival games which were out everywhere you looked just as battle royale games are now just make a big dull looking map and cram it full of to make it look like a game also better not optimise the damn thing then copy your competitor when they come up with an interesting idea in a desperate attempt to remain relevant.All in all i'm just annoyed that the egotist who made this game charges nearly 30 for it and that an old friend if i can even call her that got me to buy it only to turn into an so maybe i'm just salty over the whole thing.Maybe its just not my cup of tea or i'm right that its just a fad that'll die off in a year or so when a new fad appears.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

12/18/2017,0,0,304,FALSE,Not Recommended,In my honest opinion this game was great. So much fun. That was until they became more focused on putting new pretty things into the game instead of actually worrying about the state of the game. Almost every game I play there's someone cheating whether it be with a clicking macro ESP auto aim or often times all of the above. There were actually a lot less cheaters in the beginning months of the game where you'd expect there to be less anti cheat. But alas it's nearly an every game thing. It's ruining the game and I'm starting to have no fun with it. It gets really lame to continuously spend 10+ minutes looting just to get 4 tapped from across the map every game. And if it isn't the players it's the server just being garbage. I recently played a game where I shot a guy with a Kar in the head and watched it hit the ground behind his head. He then later challenged me where I had 5 shots into his body before he even fired and I died instantly and on the kill cam I allegedly hit him once and my internet is completely fine.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

6/26/2018,0,0,28,FALSE,Not Recommended,I really want to like this game. I've tried. So much. It's just. So. Bad.The biggest problem is the cheaters. They are in literally every game and the devs don't give two flying rips about it because it brings them revenue (they ban a cheater said cheater has to buy another copy of the game and they do because cheating is profitable for the cheaters too even if they're having to buy new copies of the game every so often).The next biggest problem is the gun mechanics. I've played games ranging from PUBG to CoD to BF to Squad to CS etc. None of them have worse gun mechanics than PUBG. Sometimes it's simply impossible to hit someone. I'm not going to say I'm the best gamer or even great or good but I know I'm better than being dead on with a reticle and missing. And there's simply nothing worse than unloading an entire clip on a guy and not hitting him then he turns snaps to your head and one shots you. Just awful.If these two things could be fixed this game would be completely different. The bugs and other weird things I can get over.

5/29/2018,0,0,115,FALSE,Not Recommended,I remember when Playerunkown's first came out... it blew my mind. It truly appeared that online gaming would change forever (did not know about H1ZI at the time). With that being said I did not buy this game because 1. I was waiting for a sale (two years later PUBG still thinks they are too good for a sale even though reviews are mostly mix). Which gets me to Number 2. Hackers. Just read down the comments and certainly you will come across some very bitter players. They have every right to be when PUBG is played as intended it is an amazing experience that changes everytime. Unfortunately hackers really RUIN this game whether they are Chinese Russian or American I am unsure but one thing is for certain none likes a cheater. Especially when games can last anywhere from 1 minute to an hour. Doing all the work only to be gun down by some dude behind a rock who MAGICALLY knows when you will be out in the open and kills you / your teammates with a headshot in the very same way is ridiculous.Fortunately I DID NOT BUY this game my friend got it for me because he wanted competent teammates. I do enjoy playing this game when everyone is playing FAIR but as you can see we are still having issues.So bottom line game is fun if you are able to play with other players on the same ground. Game gets frustrating because of cheaters and the fact that they never put this game on sale despite these issues makes me question the developers intentions. They promise gameplay improvements so we shall see...Also lootcrates are a ING JOKE in this game... you earned a crate with your battlepoints that you got in game GREAT! NOW BUY A KEY WITH REAL MONEY TO ACTUALLY OPEN IT BECAUSE YEAH!So if you are on the fence about PUBG literally just go play Fortnite. It's a free battle royale game sure you don't get first person / vehicles. However both can be enjoyed in their own right and at least with Fortnite you don't have to hate yourself for spending 30 bucks on a hacker / run simulator. Also fortnite is way more optimized and offers a new mode of play almost evey week. Conclusion Blue best un themselves or else they will be the first developer in history to define a genre and fail it completely at the same time. They really need to focus on polishing this game.

7/7/2018,0,0,191,FALSE,Not Recommended,Alright lets break down the average PlayerUnknown Battleground experience. After almost 200 hours I think I have a solid idea of what its all about.Experience 1 (most common)You land and if you land with other people you will probably be immediately killed. Experience 2 (semi common)You land with your team you kit up spend 20 minutes not seeing anyone you are fully geared. First encounter with people everyone is killed generally 2 people out of 4 won t even get a shot off before incapped. Experience 3 (rare)Luck. If luck is on your side no other reason you will get the drop on your enemies get good loot and make it to number 1. Why am I not going to recommend this game after playing almost 200 hours? Well in short my friends enjoyed this game I played it because its all they wanted to play. Did I enjoy it? Sure yeah it has its appeal and can be fun. Was most of my experience with PUBG die immediately or die after getting fully kitted yeah. That was 60 percent of the time I d play the game. Am I good? No not really so bear that in mind. So here are the consHorrible support and optimization BlueHole seems to think it s a great idea to do 3 6 hour maintenance during peak player time on West Coast time zone. I can t tell you how many nights my squad wanted to play PUBG and guess what we couldn t. It showed me how little they care for their American fans and players. They do not give a Gunplay is embarrassing/input lag with movement and picking up items This game has the worst combat I have ever had the displeasure of playing its all random. You either hit what you are aiming for and every shot misses even though you are dead on or it works because RNG or latency. There is no reliability with combat it s a grab bag of general trash and disappointment. The movement system feels like you are walking on mush when you hit spacebar it takes a second for you to jump when you want to pick up something it takes a couple seconds to register. Its all just awful. Lack of Content 3 maps since release 1 of them Mianmar (Mexico) is plain trash. They had to remove map selection because everyone veto d it. No one wants to play it there is no cover and its too frikken big. The new map is better but it feels like a cluster . Their first map was the best. I wanted to like PUBG more than I was actually able to. I see the fun and I see the appeal but in the end it is an absolute waste of time made by devs more interested in selling 6 dollar parachute skins instead of actually improving the combat or server problems. Hard pass on this game play Cuisine Royale or Totally Accurate Battlegrounds instead both have better combat.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

A fair few of them cheat too but the thing is it's hard to tell because of their crazy latency. The death cam will show them shooting empty air.

This game can be so hot today there is no doubt that it has its own competitive and entertaining nature.We can not only show the skill in the game but also experience the fun of play with friends.This game has many advantages but I still gave the negative review. It's not because of the optimization problem or the server issues of the game it's the game developers' disregard of cheating. Cheating is an unavoidable problem for FPS games. But now there is so many cheaters in this game and their attitude is too rampant. This phenomenon has reached an unmanageable point. A part of well known game hosts are publicly using cheating programs on live webcasts. Now it has been found and denounced by many netizens But the Blue Hole Company turned a blind eye to it. They never come out to explain as if they were allowed to use the cheating programs legally. More rumors said in the whitelist people on the whitelist will not be detected cheating. For many ordinary game player this argument can not be verified but if it is true it will make all the e sports enthusiasts angry. The negative review is to tell the people who saw this evaluation the game developers are not only doing nothing with the problem of cheating but also tolerate some of the hosts' cheating behavior which is intolerable. It is the embodiment of the lack of moral bottom line in Blue Hole Company. I believe that what I said above is also what many Chinese netizens want to say.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

The lack of region lock is a large oversite in my personal opinion.Update. 07/07/2018I will start this update by saying that the developers have finally managed to get the hacking/cheating under control for the most part However I still can't give this game a positive review due to the poor optimization and unnecessarily heavy demands it puts on your GPU and the poor upkeeping done by the developers who are more concerned with pushing new content then fixing the bugs and issues that have plagued this game since launch.

7/14/2017,0,0,1122,FALSE,Not Recommended,Brief synopsis You parachute down onto the battlefield and have to scavange quickly for gear and a weapon. Then like hunger games you kill the other 99 players hoping to be the ONE to survive. A circle restricts game areas and gets smaller as the time goes by. If caught outside of the area you slowly take damage until you die. It's only one map but the replay value of where you drop in what weapons you end up with where the other players drop are all key. Then surviving is entirely different. You only get one life so make it count! I recommend starting off in a squad to learn the buttons before you just roll into a game solo and get repeatedly killed it's easy to get frustrated but the payout is worth it. Knowing when to move when to fight and when to let people pass is all important but knowing how to shoot is a skill in its own. ***UPDATE*** Hackers have taken over the servers. Until this is fixed although this is my favorite game on steam it needs to be fixed. 7/10 games a night with hackers is unacceptable. This can be fixed by either a. Making items untradeable (but not profitable for bluehole) or b. Putting all new accounts with less than 300 full games into seperate servers. This way the hackers with new accounts are only fighting eachother saving the rest of the players from the punishment. It wont stop all of them but it will certainly slow the hoard of chineese hackers. They talked about banning China for a while since studies show 95% of them are buying the game going to internet cafes' and selling crates for profit and making alot of money in doing so.

The game breaking bugs broken mechanics and lifeless textures will keep anyone hooked onto this masterpiece for countless hours. The fact that 90% of the map is simply open fields and deserts forces the player to think and keep on their toes which i believe was an excellent choice by the devs. I've heard a few friends complain that the design of the map simply forced them to land into areas of the map that had buildings and loot which rendered the exploration of the rest of the map to be pointless however i couldn't disagree more. I'd happily admit that a solid two hour margin out of my nine hours played was just me running in emptiness. During all that time i was shocked and astounded at the beautiful greys browns and faint greens i was surrounded by. I was glad that the developers didn't finish the game before releasing it like the majority of game companies do.

I read in PC gamer that bluehole claimed the vast majority of hacker were from China..

Based upon the limited available evidence it appears a Chinese company Tencent has bought a 5% stake in the game to allow it to be sold in China and are creating and selling the hacks on the backend. So basically the developer is in cahoots with the hack devs. Tencent's stake purchases also coincides perfectly with the meteoric explosion in concurrent players on steam stats.While it seemed for sometime the devs actually cared about bringing the game to completion it appears this game will go the way of its predecessors Dayz Warz and H1Z1 into irrelevancy.

Rumor has it PUGB is running a verison of Unreal engine that has an exploit hackers can use to get undetected by battleye and what not so If you want a hack free game have fun waiting for the fix because this game has been out almost a year and no sign of fix. Whats worse about it is there is a report system however it will does nothing. The game is considered released however it plays like a pre alpha. So many glitches which affect gameplay exist. I honestly forgive the devs of No Man's Sky after playing PUGB. At least it was playable.Another thing is this game needs a region lock like Starcraft 2 pre 3.0 where NA players are forced on NA etc. Having a lock decreases the chances of someone having an advantage since the lag and ping will be managable etc.Other than that.

4/10/2018,1,1,213,FALSE,Not Recommended,"When I was first introduced to this last man standing shooter game I was quite interested in PUBG. But after playing it for almost 200 hours the game itself starts to get me bored. I am not saying the game won't give you the feeling of thrill when you are playing. I'm saying after making such great amount of money before even releasing this game Bluehole wasn't adding a lot of new stuff to the game. So now everytime I play this game it's either I drop at a popular spot and get a gun and kill the unlucky guy who didn't get a gun when they landed or it's me who got killed. Also the company really didn't work on their weapons they made a great amount of money by selling copies of the game and now they don't even work on the actual ""in game content"" which could be adding more variety of weapons to the game. Instead they try to make more money by giving weapon skins. In comparison there is another last man standing shooter game that is quite popular right now which is called ""Fortinite"". It is a free game first of all and in my opinion this game has already surpassed PUBG in every way. While PUBG is trying to make more and more money Fortnite is keeping the game free and is about to unlock a PVE mode for every player in 2018. You can still pay the game to get cooler skins but it's not like PUBG that you will have to be really lucky to get what you want because you can only buy crates in game and get random items otherwise the price in the steam market is unbelievably high for a decent item. ""You buy what you want in Fortnite"". Fortnite also keeps adding new stuff to the game. This is why it doesn't make me feel ""repetitive"" to play. It normally has an update on every thursday sometimes there will be a new skin adding to the game a new type of gun a new rarity of an existing type of gun or even a new landing spot on the map. On weekends there will be a special play mode which I found out that PUBG recently copied this feature. There are so much more that Fortnite has done better than PUBG. You can see by yourself that there are more viewers in Fortnite sections than in PUBG section on twitch recently. I don't want to say I hate PUBG I will still play it with my friends sometimes but I personally prefer Fortnite. In the long run if Bluehole doesn't start to respond to the need of their players like what Fortnite is doing and really developing their game I don't think it is going to last longer than 2 years.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

It felt like such a breath of fresh air in the multiplayer world but as time passes by you come to a realisation this game isnt getting any better. Many of its player base gave it a chance arguing it was still in early access but bugs and issues which were in the game from the start are still there and nothing is changing. The only thing which is changing is the amount of skins purchasable in the game starting out light for their events its grown into literally not even being able to have access to even the most basic skins because they are overshadowed by the vast amount of loot boxes which require keys. An example of this is the in game currency you use to obtain loot crates they used to be free to open but require more and more currency to open but now you arent able to get any of these crates which are free to open because they are layered under locked boxes. The only change which seems to be happening is whenever you log into the game you are greeted by more and more advertisement for some way to give more money to bluehole. While the servers are a mess frame rates are low bugs are abundant in every map they release. Its just saddening that this game has so much potential if they would just focus more on the game rather than paid loot boxes and event passes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Inconsistencies in damage output is mind boggling with point blank shotgun hits doing less damage than a single punch to the face.

On that topic why bring in more weapons when there are already other things that need addressing before I could say this is ready for the public.

Two excellently designed maps and a large assortment of gear and weapons make this a great game but with a black eye due to seemingly reactive measures to stop cheating instead of being proactive to keep them from ruining the game in the first place. The first week of 2018 had me encountering BLATENT cheaters about 1/3 rounds and suspected cheaters another 1/3 rounds. Given the slow cautious format generally taken by someone who tries to win each round this is extremely frustrating to play 8 15 minutes just to have to wait another couple minutes followed by several more minutes of getting set up again just to be full auto headshotted again from 100 yards out with an UMP or hip shotted from 300 yards by a guy strafing sideways named Yangatsu_1478 or something of the likes.My recommendation do NOT buy this game until they get the cheating under control which hopefully they do because it is a truely awesome game when cheaters arent around.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Don't go for it while in the hopes of complete satisfaction as a overall game. The optimization sucks awfully. We gotta expect everyone to have super computers for full efficiency. The development team for the potential sake of the happiness of us as a player base or even just as customers to just play the game is bad. Coming up to play the game and we have to deal with a work that has more time and money invested in it to make more money. I'm sorry to make this a two point thing but it is. It's more of a business structure than a product in the gaming industry. (following up the last point) Milking so much money out of events and just purchases and start ups from the early access point but none to show for progress. It seems that daily progression of life improvements in this game is intentionally being taken one step per day when they can just leap or take at least two steps in moving forward with the state of the game. You encounter one bug. It gets fixed. But... the new patched version has plus 2 new bugs in place of the one that's fixed.+ The development of this game is actually progressing and the people at work on this have not dropped this. At least... + It is extremely fun to play. Whether you're in for the solo thrill or the salty blissful company of your mates.+ It is exactly worth the price it is tagged for. But what the actual f**k did they do with it ?? + Player base is pretty dank.+/ (mixed status point) Not for the soft hearted where you get triggered due to a meme or racial slurs(97% of the games). Of course the solution to mute all voice is simple and easily present.+ Comedic tactic points are possible in this game.+ If I had to say mechanically this is the best battle royale game out at present. Hackers. (Inevitable in multiplayer games but the system dealing with it is pretty meh) The state of being a ""early access game"" as a defense to excuse yourself is ridiculously hilarious. I mean what are you doing out here making virtual cosmetics (garbage RNG drop rates even for getting an average quality of a skin) making tournament events with players from all over the world. Just make a choice to go down one path ffs. (No salt just stating the situation fyi I don't have interests in skins) If you get matched into a game with a streamer in it you get screwed over apparently. (?)

I really don't care for games like H1Z1 or DayZ. I never liked the whole Ironman survival style games where it's you vs the server.That being said this game is like those mentioned above but without the bloat and BS attached. It is simple and accessible. You jump into a game you see how long you can live and you leave when you're done No strings attached. This product comes with a nice touch of tactical gameplay and highly encourages groups of up to 4.That being said this game is not something I would play alone. Having atleast a partner to communicate with and have your back...and also have a few laughs with along the way makes an otherwise stressful situation that much more fun. What I like most is the playable area constantly gets smaller as the round continues on forcing players to find eachother and fight till the last one stands. This also means that rounds will not last forever even if you are in the last 5 of 100 players.Being an early access game expect to find bugs/latency/server issues. However with the developer earning over $11 million dollars on the launch weekend alone we can hope the funding fixes these issues. Literally the only things I would want to see added to this game are improvements/bug fixes new maps and more gear.It's worth the 30 dollars.

1/1/2018,0,0,81,FALSE,Not Recommended,This game has plenty of issues that need to be resolved but it does not seem to be Bluehole's priority. That is the major reason I cannot reccomend this game at the moment. The weapon skins they added are a clear sign of that. I mainly play first person servers now since third person is still pretty heavy on the hacker side of things. It does seem like it has gotten better but not enough to call the problem solved. In addition the recent updates have caused the servers to be unstable ( at least on my end). It does not affect actual gameplay once you find a game but it is an annoyance no one should have to deal with.The game is still fun if you do not take it to seriously. For example playing the new event mode they added is pretty good.

8/11/2017,0,0,180,TRUE,Not Recommended,This is an amazing game with beautiful gun mechanics well built on a wonderful idea.

I'm sick and tired of playing this game on my $1 200 gaming PC and not being able to actually play due to game issues.Unfortunately I can not recommend this game to anybody in its current state. For a game with 1 000 000 concurrent players you would think that the developers will do something to save their game and fix the bugs but they don't listen.You know why I know they don't listen? Simple!A known bug that was in the Technical Test Server that defaulted all users to the Asia servers regardless of their geological location. This means tons of North American players are accidentally on the Asia servers every day. This is annoying why did you break your own game? This bug was reported to the PUBG developers IN TESTING over 1 000 times... Yet do you know how they fixed it?

6/29/2018,0,0,52,FALSE,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. While I rarely write reviews this one is a must so I ll keep it unbiased moderate and coincise.I'm a software engineer and a game development hobbyist I got this game as a gift from a friend who bought it on sale I used to watch online streams and have watched some of shroud so I have a fairly good idea about the game and the genre. What I liked The battle royal genre in this game is awesome the idea that you jump from a plane with other +90 enemies (solo) is thrilling experience you have to act quickly no movements wasted every second and every bullet counts. The blue zone idea is what complements this game's success its like the salt and pepper you apply to your food forcing everyone to fight aggressively for that chicken dinner. The battle system is pretty good I love the weapons recoil and reload the incoming fire sound is quite realistic as if you're fighting in real life quite an exotic implementation if I may say so. What I hated No introduction to the game no training bootcamps no briefing just instantly thrown into chaos veterans have a considerably higher survival chance. Next level EA microtransactions godforbid . The game lags like a there I've said it. Again I'm a game development hobbyist and have a fairly good knowledge on game optimization but omfg the amount of opimitzation they could have done by now would have helped this game retain its position (yes its going downhill) I played titles like GTA and OW and the amount of optimization this game requires isn't much and could be done within only 1 2 weeks or less (1 man job for at least +50% acceptable optimization) at this point its very questionable what in the world they're doing with their budget. I've spent an hour optimizing this game and even went online to try out community tweaks and the max fps I was able to obtain is a spiking 50 90 on a 144hz monitor with decent specs since I obtained my 144hz monitor I'm never able to go back to 60fps as it lags like a 30fps game I don't like sluggish games running on reasonable OC specs especially when the game settings are lowered to its absolute limit the game performance with its current game models is simply unjustifiable. So is the game ready for the public?A No. It's been rushed and it needs to be optimized bugs and glitches need to be ironed as well.Don't take my review the hard way I'm just an unbiased player giving you my totally unbiased opinion if the game works well for you then enjoy it while you can the reason I didn't even consider Fortnite is because PUBG looked more ""mature"" but now I'm dissapointed and I won't continue playing it until I receive news of proper optimization update.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
7/8/2018,0,0,578,FALSE,Not Recommended,Used to love the game concept but as all my friends have stopped playing by now it is time for me as well to realise how bad this game's current state is at.

5/31/2018,0,0,58,FALSE,Not Recommended,It's a game that has taken heavy inspiration from many other games. Many games exists that inspired the Battle Royale formula this includes H1Z1 Contagion DayZ etc. This game had the same ambitious motivation as its original mod from ARMA III to take from all of these and polish the mechanics to create this. Battle royale though has been in movies and books for many years has never been properly implemented in video games to such a scale until PUBG and Fortnite came to the scene both games greatly motivated by Day Z no doubt since Day Z showed the industry what gamers really want (since lets face it most people played the game for the survival aspect against other players not the zombies or the very tedious survival elements). The game looks pretty good for a game originating from its team size the gameplay is far from perfect but clearly polished. Many mechanics are imperfect but can be learned to be adjusted to. The greatest issues is their attempt in addressing cheaters and the amount of time it may take to fill games. The game also loads a lot for a long time so the ier players like myself may find themselves loading the game and being on the main menu more than actually playing the gameplay. Another issue is that the player count and map size ratio causes players to cross paths less frequently than desired mid game making it sometimes feel like work to play the game as intended (since how many times does one wish to play safely to relive what they did last hundred games?). Another issue is their special events and how they handle them. Players clearly enjoyed the eight player squads and would like to see it as an available mode regularly especially those of us that have more than three friends. What seems ideal is some form of deathmatch mode for us to just have quick and easy games maybe even practice the gun game meta. Their interpetation of a deathmatch is just a randomized mess with a terrible spawn system. You spawn with random guns meaning some have what feels unfair starting gear depending on the situations that starts. The spawn system is the same as the core mode parachuting. This is bad on small maps like deathmatch because players gain control of areas fast and get to loot for gear meaning they snowball while players respawning die more. This game isn't finished and the speed of developement is lackluster. The controversy of the team focusing more on their petty lawsuits rather than game developement tells us what they're focused on more than making a good game money. Instead of improving the game polishing all the issues they invest time in loot crates and time in lawsuits suing others for taking inspiration from their game. Hypocritical this game is far from original it's merely a polished interpetation of what we have had for nearly ten years on the market. For them to sue as if they own something they didn't create is ridiculous for them to address their losing battles against competition by suing them out of business rather than improving their own product shows us their intentions. This is a good game that was ruined by money. Get it on the cheap it's not worth full price when there is competition out there that's gaining popularity for a reason that's free.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Basically the game still runs like crap on the old map and the newer one has gotten worse. The lag is still prevalent and is even worse with the influx of Chinese players on the North American server. Basically around half of any North Amercian lobby will be chinese players. The cheating is extreme although they added a kill cam it basically useless for figuring out if they are cheating. It will lag so much it is not worth even looking at it........ Car spawns are horrible too! Boat spawn more then cars! How much sense does that make???Overall it can be a fun game. But in the current state that its in I can hardly recomend it.Update 1.0 Okay it would appear that the last patch made the old map more stable however more testing will be needed before I can re edit my review. Also the replay ability within the lobby is crashing every time now! Cheaters are also very dominate just got killed by a wall aimbot hacker. I'm really tring to re like this game but its really hard.Update 1.1 Well the game still runs like crap! The update didn't fix it at all. Overall lag is better!Update 1.2 Installed new drivers for my GTX 970 game runs much smother now. Will do some more testing before I remove from un edited review! Lag is still within the first five ten minutes. Not to bad but can still be a pain in the butt if you drop with an enemy. Cheaters are still horrible got shot in the face by a shotgun across the map.......... Yeah I rage quited after that one (TBH)!Update 1.3 (8/16/2018) I stopped playing this game for a while becaase it still has not been improved and I was getting burnt out on it! I restarted to play it after months! It's pretty much the same as before! Horrible netcoding ping bugs and just poor optimization! The devolopers want to push money more then fixing their game.

5/14/2017,0,0,37,FALSE,Not Recommended,When this game first game out I had the same reaction as a lot of others as the battle royal game scene hasn't had the best reputation as of late. H1Z1 left a bad taste in my mouth and I was hoping this genre had died forever ... Enter PUBG.The game rolled out wit a bang and made some real noise on the Twitch community but big deal right? H1Z1 was the same way and like I said I hated that game ... like a lot. So I didn't really give it a lot of attention but PUBG don't care PUBG don't give a sh*t it just kept doing it's thing and by god it's thing turned out to be pretty damn cool. I made a stand that I wasn't going to buy the game until it hit a sale. (mostly because I never got that H1Z1 refund I always wanted) I lasted about 2 weeks until my friends started caving and the temptation of having a squad to play with guarenteed this games way into my library.So I'm right around 20 hours and here's my report Desync is terrible like you get hit my shots or cars when you feel like you're way behind cover and sometimes how much you have to lead a player depends more on the amount of lag rather than the distance.The gear is repetitive yet effective maybe some people are getting air drops a lot and seeing that high tier gear but I've yet to get anything in a drop as they have always guarenteed death for me or the ones that havent have been terrible.Despite these being some decent issues the game is a lot of fun and only has room to grow since it's still in early access. There haven't been any major updates at this point but I'll attempt to update this review when they do so.I reccomend this game to if you want to play with friends but with all the issues so far I can't reccomend this game.

PUBG has sold over 50 million copies seeing that they are 30 bucks a pop then it is reasonable to estimate gross revenue at 1.5 billion dollars. Granted they have to pay their dues but this still leaves them with a large amount of money. And how they choose to spend is most damning they bring a frivolous lawsuit against Epic Games in a thinly veiled attempt to force Fortnite out of the market and in turn take a larger share of the market they keep implementing various ways to monetize PUBG in order to squeeze as much money as they can from the playerbase. the initial estimate of 1.5 BILLION dollars does not take into consideration the money they made from monetizing the Game.

7/15/2018,0,0,454,FALSE,Not Recommended,Ive put over 400 hours into this game since early alpha... honestly its gotten worse over time. When it first came out and after a lot of the first updates the game was looking good and i played it a LOT. Devs cared about the game and the issues and every update seemed to make everything better. But somewhere along when miramar got launched this game started to really suffer... at least in my eyes. The desync issues random crashes laggy hit reg just make me hate this game even though I love the gameplay and the concept. As of right now I can't really understand how they can claim this game is tournament ready or competitive mode ready at all... I literally chuckle every time i see the PUBG Invitational background. It just seems so ridiculous. I could care less about new maps and skins and vehicles as long as the CORE gameplay is really refined and well tuned. Fixing the desync lag and random crashes (crashes that i only have experienced after the last update) would make a world of difference. Maybe the devs just made too much money too fast... I can only hope that eventually I can redact my verdict on this game but for now not recommended at all. Good concept good feel poor optimization. It's really killing this game for me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
1/3/2018,0,0,181,FALSE,Not Recommended,The game is exciting and tense. It is a stressful game AT BEST! Because of how tense and frustrerating this game can be laying the seemingly exorbitant number of cheaters now more obvious thanks to the death cam tips the game over from intense and stresful but satisfying to an excercise in frustration. I am taking a break from this game. I hope that Bluehole manages to get a handle on the cheeting problem in this game. The monitization and steam marketplace integration has proven to be a bad decsion. A few options to solve this problem would be to region lock it to ping lock it or to add a second layer of anti cheat software or detection such as the iron fist of VAC or removing steam marketplace integration to remove the incentive to farm credits(lol as if that will ever happen) If the cheating problem can be resolved it will be a great game again. Now its not a good experieince and I encourage anybody thinking about purchasing it to wait and see what steps are taken to make the game more fair for everybody.Edit**After attempting to fix the cheating problem with the battleye launcher Bluehole has fully bricked my game. I am compleatly unable to launch it due to a .dll error in an unrelated folder for an unrelated application. I can no longer launch the game at all and none of the fixes proposed anwhere worked.

Nothing seems to be being implemented to combat people running scripts and various other 'cheats' so much so that these people are managing to rack up enough time in game to get onto the leaderboards with 50+ games is obviously a sign that very poor anti cheat measures are being used. When 1.0 launched managed to rack up 40 games in the first week and only encountering 1 maybe 2 blatant cheaters now literally every 2 games or so you encounter them especially if you get top10 and continually getting squad wiped from hip fire sprays.

11/23/2017,0,0,383,FALSE,Not Recommended,So last review I wrote quite long time ago and since it was an early access I was hoping that Blue Hole will fix all the bugs and make this game awesome. However they did not do anything and just made this game worse than it was before. Tons of bugs lots of cheaters and now for some reason 90% of time I am playing on the new map 'miramar' that has so many bugs in a map you can die just doing nothing at all.The problem with cheaters. I think that everyone in this game saw cheaters at least at once and when you play this game as much as I play then you start to hate this game cuz of cheaters. AND NOW you can't even properly report them if you get killed and start to spectate your teammates you can only report them but for some reason you can't report other players.Another problem is 'miramar'. For some reason now I am playing this map around 80% of all the time. I am getting it nearly always. Why can't users choose map that they want to play on or at least make chance of playing on different maps 50/50.The last but not least is problem with FPS in this game. Yes the game looks quite good but it doesn't mean that you have to buy 2x 1080ti to play this game on ultra settings. I have nvidia 1080 and when I am playing other games I usually can set up everything on high/ultra settings but not in this game. You can get lags even using medium settings with 1080!In conclusion I want to say that the game idea is awesome but if Blue Hole comp. won't fix the bugs people will stop playing it. Every update makes playing worse and worse. Blue Hole please fix the game.PS. In this review I didn't write about quite many things about insta crashes etc... But you know...

It was enjoyable learning how everything worked how to compose yourself when you were up against "" Destr0yer69XD"" who was killing everyone in the top 10 and how easily all your time in the match could be stripped from you by one bullet to the face. The adrenaline rush was great. Now though? No no no no. Auto run is your best friend. You simply dont care if you die because its probably a hacker or your connection the server was just a millisecond behind the guy who shot you even though you shot him 37 times in the head from point blank.

If they are they sure are doing a terrible job monetising anything you can think of and wasting time making lawsuits they cant win.

I have 600 hrs and i'm just getting angrier at the game. it feels weird to be thumb downing such a popular game which i myself played for over 300 hours enjoyed with friends had some unforgettably entertaining moments in and whose best players i watched often on twitch when unable to play myself.however thumbs down it is and the game has been uninstalled.when i got the game in september of last year it was a hot relatively new thing with amazing potential and it was forgivable to have all the wonky issues (desync start game lag etc). since then the early access game has gone gold introduced a new map added cosmetics and taunts changed balance in weapons addressed cheats etc. the dev team has definitely been busy and adding a lot of content and interest to the game.the problem? the foundation on which pubg is built hasn't changed. at this point given the focus of the dev team this signals to me that it will likely never change.the devs attempted to fix the start of game lag by redistributing starting player locations and removing pre game items. to me this is a clear indication that the basic problem in the engine hasn't been addressed just worked around. the client to client discrepancies due to architecture decisions made early in the development process now seem unlikely to be addressed in the future.ask yourself how many times the pubg engine misrepresents player positions and angles when a kill happens. the likelihood is that more often than not someone typically the one on the receiving end ) is shaking their head and it genuinely doesn't have anything to do with their reactions to what they see in the game.as a comparison take the decade old source engine that drives counter strike global offensive. you can complain all you want about that game but the base it is built on is incredibly solid. the surprises at every level of play have to do with player skill not engine quirks.when TSM_Viss returned from IEM Katowice 2018 in march having played only on LAN and not online for several days he had this to say https //clips.twitch.tv/SwissCaringSowHoneyBadger ""after playing on LAN you come back to this you guys have no idea how much lag we play with constantly in this game ... if they could get the game feeling like how it feels on LAN online ho my god. it would be a dream.""it's 2018.2 decades since Quake World set the bar for responsiveness in online games you simply can't have an action FPS run on an engine that must allow as much unreliability in perspective as PUBG and with no signs of that ever being addressed.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Since my first install i have never been able to buy loot crates with battle points leaving my character naked with an empty inventory (wardrobe) screen. I am also unable to change my characters appearance leading the accumulation of somewhere just over 25 000 battle points. Much to my disappointment after the patch near 8/3/2017 all of my battle points are missing now and i am UNABLE TO EARN MORE from matches i play now. This is unacceptable and will be what breaks me from playing this game. I have reinstalled the game more than once and appears to be a bug attached to my account. i have posted about this in the past and would love to hear ANYTHING from anyone with information.

Today two of my friends along with thousand others (looking at reddit threads) randomly got banned from steam via the devs at BH. Most likely this will be resolved quickly but the way this is being handled is beyond bad. Although I will continue to monitor the game I'll most likely never play it frequently (at all) or as my go to game anymore and I would advise others to stay away from a product mainly aimed at being a money grabbing scheme with no promise of becoming a finished polished product.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Your mileage may vary though especially when you have friends.And no I'm not talking about the region lock that everyone wants to be implemented to a certain country.

6/28/2018,0,0,433,FALSE,Not Recommended,Alright lets get down to it First off I've played a good bit of this game. Most of it is when it was first released and the months following. This was all before the official release. And my time playing it was great either solo or with friends this game was a fresh breathe to my steam library. How ever the game never really felt crisp. The mechanics of the game as far as shooting and then later added vaulting have always felt great with minor changes here and there. But the games actual performance can be just downright pathetic. Not to mention the constant server issues that game used to have not that it is perfect now but you understand. This game had a lot to prove and in a lot of ways it really paved the way for this Battle Royale Genre to be seen by many. However Bluehole or PUBG corp what ever they want to call themselves I hope you are reading this. You are by far the worst most pathetic money hungry peace of company I have ever seen ruin a game. You charge $30 for a game then fill it with a loot crate system that with most crates NEED a $2.50 key to open? Seriously what the are you about? Not only did you make over $750 million dollars from copies sold across Xbox/PC but then you add mobile which is pretty much another market scheme and now you add a $10 battle pass where half of the items you get are TIMED? And you want to sit there and sue another company because they grabbed your spotlight with a Free to play game that can actually perform better. I would not ever recommend this game to anyone not because the game isnt fun or its boring (Miramar however is boring imo) but its because this games company does not care about there entire community asking for stability. They care for the next bundle of cash they can sweep up.

Lag is terrible the game is very badly optimized as even with ultra it looks horrible.I keep dying behind walls because of the 1 2 second delays in shooting picking up weapons is delayed to 3 4 seconds and the inventory system is very unintuitive. When falling out of the airplane sometimes the houses aren't renderer or loaded at all and I stay falling in mid air until I get shot. The game has basically no skill based matchmaking so there is the 99% that won't win a single game in a 100 hours and the 1% (shroud) who wins about 10 games in the row.

On the flipside the coding is horrible and the tick rate is an absolute joke dipping as low as 2 ticks per second and only ever gets up to around 20 at it's max. The FPS is horrible and is more demanding than games with graphics that might actually be worth turning up to ultra. It's full of hackers and the incidence of people using soft hacks (ie. walls etc.) is rife and out of control. The devs have stopped listening to the community and now change the game in ways which seem counter to how the people who play the game feel it needs to move positively. I've played 1600 hours of this game and I honestly wish I had never even downloaded it. It's trash and the slowdown has started.

If you can not create anti cheat system then remove loot boxs or crates which will lead hacks to look away from the game for a time being making the game fair again until you have designed an anti cheat system.

For example in cloudy weather someone in the end will kill you if they have a hack which they can see through the clouds. This is so unfair and in all honesty it pisses you off when you get second place because the other person is a hacker. The developers must control this like in GTA where Rockstar has done a phenomenal job by clearing modders. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FOR THIS GAME MAKE YOU EXTREMELY UNSATISFIED. If you look at this game and see the reviews prior it has been great and the game itself is amazing. But the maintance and finding the real hackers is tough so give the developers a break.

I have had occasional hard crashes of the game without an error warning heavy lagging due to server load vehicle colisions into minor changes of terrain height (bridge abutments and visibly minute changes in terrain grade) and experienced/witness the player model getting trapped next to objects (one witnessed today resulting in the death of a team mate by ""falling damage"" from a 4 foot high crate).

But now that it's 1.0 it's still buggy as all hell. they decided right before the full release that they were going to pivote to Xbox. they focused all they're time and recources to that development. i find that very . Also hackers have always been a problem. But now it is even more unbearable. i heard a stat that was like 70 percent of the hackers come from china. why not region lock that country. they have way more than enough to sustain thier own servers. And no it is absolutly not racist. if the fact is that most of the hackers are from china and that they are ruining it for all other people why should the rest of the player base have to deal with that?

8/10/2018,0,0,448,FALSE,Not Recommended,So I've given this game over 300 hours since the initial release of the game and I cannot at all say that I recommend the title to people who like shooting games. This is unfortunate because the feeling of winning this game is quite a high.The greatest detriment to this game is the fact that it has been over one whole year and they still call it a completed game. If it isn't the servers dumping out on you it's the poor optimization of the world geometry killing you. If it isn't world geometry it's the vehicle mechanics killing you when your ride decides that the piece of land you just drove over should launch you into low Earth orbit so you come crashing down in a fiery explosion. Beyond that the fact that they claim to have fixed these problems and more is just a bold lie to say the very least. Every patch they say optimization features have been updated and work better and every patch it does not seem as if anything at all has changed. Step further and every patch itself that claims to fix two bugs has introduced ten more bugs in the code.I think perhaps the most insulting thing though is the ownership and operation of the game itself. Bluehole and PUBG Corporation claim to be doing their level best to fix this game yet they spent money and resources on developing a mobile PUBG for phones and tablets. They spent money and time organizing a professional scene so they could make more sponsorship money and yet still that money has not reflected anything on the game itself in terms of functionality and a focus on fixing the problems that doggedly persist through every single patch. Even more insulting is that they use the default patch delivery service for Unreal Engine which would be fine if they were a small indie studio working on their first game but seeing as how they make millions I see no excuse for this game to even have half of the problems that plague it to this day. Perhaps the most discussed issue is the blatant cheating in this game. The claim they make that they have put into place anti cheat software and methods to remove cheaters from the game is laughable at best and a complete lie at the worst. Every set of patch notes seems to be a scripted piece that has been put up and while some of the patch notes might be accurate seeing them reflected in the game is woefully underwhelming when the issues they address in their updates are not the most prominent problems this game faces. The fact that a game that has earned millions does not even claim to have server side verification of client side game states is both amateurish and lazy. With all the money they make from the game sales from previously banned players you would think that the easy solutions would be easy to implement but alas excuses continue to come from the company. They refuse to address the issue of the overwhelming presence of Chinese cheat accounts letting this game slip further and further from the potential it once had. The attempts to placate people with promises of coming solutions that never come to fruition tells me that this company is more concerned with earning millions from banned players rebuying the game than trying to improve the game performance and experience for those who have bought the game and want to experience it without people using scripts and other cheat mechanics to exploit this game's terrible coding.2/10 and only because actually winning a match in this dreadful bucket of excrement is actually satisfying.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

1/14/2018,0,0,514,FALSE,Not Recommended,"I won't mince my words here.The problem with this game is that it's a great proof of concept game with a poor follow through. The game's core premise is great huge deathmatch military sim style arena the problem is everything else. After the game concept's hype has worn off you'll get tired of things like getting killed by random teamates not obtaining chicken dinner because of 360 spinning map hackers with snap headshotting hacking the overall lag that is noticably apparent throughout such as when falling from the plane onto the ground for the first time. You may even notice that you feel like there is plenty of room for other innovation that just didn't make it.In my opinion the worst bit is the teamkilling that seems to be pathetically rampant. Just look up ""sxk7 team killing"" and you'll also note they have a no self defense policy tolerance. That is if you've vested 25 minutes in a game and notice team killing intent you can (ahem will) be reported for defending yourself. The best part of this joke is that you can then sign yourself up for another round of this ridiculous behavior. Particularly I've noticed this community's hunger for team killing or finding workarounds for getting you killed just to loot your body. In fact you'll notice many times your teamates are watching and waiting to loot your body first after an encounter.Take the above mix it in with the fact that in the NA server you will almost never be assigned to an English speaking team and you have a pathetic toxic Tower of Babel of an experience.See here is the problem. There needs to be NOTICABLE mechanics to prevent such toxicity. For example remove friendly fire allow for a no loot friendly option in matchmaking enable some type of post friendly fire vote kicking and I'm sure there are many other direct alternatives.This is the type of problem that primes people hop off this for the best next alternative to this battle royale genre.TL DR So here's the thing if your not going to be playing with friends and you intend to play group fps matches don't buy this game. You vest to much time per round only to get it stolen by ridiculous problems. To be honest with the rampant hacking your probably better off not buying this period.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

9/23/2018,0,0,486,FALSE,Not Recommended,The only reason I have so much playtime is because PUBG is all my buddy wants to play. I'd rather gouge my eyeballs out to be honest but playing with friends is more fun than playing on your own.Here are just some of the reasons why I absolutely despise this game The character movement feels slow and sluggish almost as if the character is not actually connected to your keyboard. In first person mode you feel like a toddler because the character model is too small compared to the map. The gunplay is supposed to be realistic but it's too much for me. Realism can be a good thing but only when it's carefully balanced with fun. I think PUBG completely missed that mark. And even when your shots are on point there is a good chance they will be blocked by invisible walls. Some fences can be penetrated from one side but not from the other making the player on the right side near invincible. Armor often doesn't display correctly. On your screen an enemy might have no armor making you think it's an easy kill. You rush him only to find out that he was actually rocking a level 3 vest that soaked up all your bullets. The loot spread is very inconsistent. One game you loot a compound of 5 buildings and you're pretty much set the next game you land at the same compound and you barely find anything. I get battle royales are a quest for loot but PUBG failed to balance this a fun and fair way. If you want to see anybody you'll have to land in a popular area. Because of the insconsistent loot this game has now become an RNG fest to see who finds a viable weapon first. But if you land in a safe area there is a good chance you won't see anybody for the first 20 minutes of the game. You aimlessly walk around ultimately losing your concentration so that when you finally are in a fight you might not be ready for it. The devs worked on a dynamic circle which closes faster or slower depending on how many people are left. This makes the game a little better but for some reason they chose to only implement the dynamic circle on one of the three maps. If you lose a fight you're frustrated because it often took you so long to get to the point. If you win a fight you burned through resources and now you have to find loot again. Kills and even wins are rarely satisfying. The game still runs very poorly and with all the flaws mentioned above I genuinely wonder how people can still play this game on a day to day basis especially with such a slow content roll out.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

10/17/2017,0,0,422,TRUE,Not Recommended,I bought this game just to play with my friends who told me it was a fairly decent game. Upon purchase ive played roughly 3 hours that day. Since i was obviously new to the game i didnt notice anything about it since i was still learning. After then havent touched the game since. Fast forward to months ahead between the last 3 months i picked this back up again. After pouring noticable hours in the first week or two. I started to get completely annoyed/frustrated with the game. First off i want to say the geography of the maps or the physics of it is seriously ridiculous. Unbelievably so. Driving a Dacia motorbike etc you can run into invisible walls/slants in the field that puts the car into a full stop dealing some damage. But there was nothing in the way the car couldnt scale over. Walking up mountains or hills is a mission on its own let alone having to run ALL THE WAY TO THE SAFE ZONE with no available vehicles around in sight. Its like they put it all on one side of the map either youre lucky enough to find one or you run the rest of your game to the safe zone. Rails are invincible with other things. Also parachuting in a a joke. Silly fall damage and it doesnt even cut the chute right away when you need to. Sometimes getting caught on a invisible telephone line or whatever.Second would be jumping on boxes like in Georgopol and novo etc. Im jumping forward but the character slides off to the right or left? Are these boxes made of grease and butter? Makes no sense why jumping forward/onto boxes has to be another game on its own. Third is the looting system RNG. You take forever to even get a gun in some buildings this happens numerous amount of times. School for example have 3 4 story buildings with no guns. Some rooms remain empty and its always the same ones. I had to hit two more buildings after that just to find a gun. This happens in multiple games. Now youre even futher behind on guns armor and safe zone each time this happensFourth one is major Combat. You guys do nothing to encourage firefights/engagements with other players at all!! Majority of the time youre spending on looking for loot to get a decent gun to fight vehicles to get to the zone (if there is even any). People camp so hard in this game its so stupid. Also the weapon damage to armor ratio calculations. They dont sync up at all. The bullets ignore all armor. I get hit once and none of it touches my armor but more than half my health is gone. As if armor in this game doesnt really matter so much kinda starting to look like cosemetics with a bit of purpose. Although cosemetics never really had a purpose in any game to begin with.Lastly the different types weather mode is ridiculous (but its really whatever in my opinion). I dont need rain or fog or sunset in my game play. In the rain you cant hear the fog eliminates more than 80% of your vision so there's point in holding a 8x scope. The 4x is alright and do able but hey still carring that 8x just in case right? If the devs implemented an option in the settings box to toggle that on and off this wouldnt be a problem since some of us dont care for this. Just fix the en game.Pros Feels good when you get a kill Getting an AR right upon landing Certain loot spots can deck you out very quickly (rarely and if lucky)Cons Looting system for guns/armor/vehicle Games physics/geography layout invisible walls or any kind of sort that gets you stuck for no reason No enough encouragment for combat during gameplay since everyone camps and waits to hear a car roll by to shoot at it but not at each other. Weapon dmg to armor ratio (bullets ignore armor) Cant open doors responsively and jump on boxes (you slide off like its butter) Game isnt ultimately optimized for br&gt Lag spikes up the wazoo Not regioned locked bunch of cheaters/hackersOnce Destiny 2 comes out this month for PC bye bye to this game. Until then your days are coming to an end by next week Blueballs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

4/3/2017,1,1,513,TRUE,Not Recommended,This is the kind of fun game that's just developed by the wrong people. It's a good concept true to the fun with friends idea you can have a great time with a full squad and not much difficulty winning if you want to try but you'll have far more fun playing risky for kills. However the drawbacks for this game are many the poor optimisation is the most prominent and the reason i'm giving this game a negative review until they fix it. This is my personal experience I have a very good PC with an SSD (disk speed is the cause of this) and even I get buildings made out of rubber that I can't enter for the first 20 seconds of every game. This sounds not too bad but in the starting minutes of a round you'll likely be surrounded by enemies all running for guns at which point you can do absolutely nothing besides be punched shot or blown up and watch them as they do it. If scores were possible for games I would give this a 5/10 the concept is great and the gameplay can be very fun and lead to dynamic unique encounters every run but the performance issues leave it entirely lacking if the other person has a worse connection than you.

This is in spite of a promise not to do so being at the very top of their FAQ page and something they have been praised for up until this point.For a game that still has enorous technical problems that make it a strain to run on even state of the art equipment Player Unknown's Battlegrounds is ugly janky and prone to infuriating bugs that occur in the most critical situations.

If you own this game (meaning that you wasted $30) uninstall and literally download Fortnite for free right now. This is one of those games that has good potential but very incompetent developers. Since day one PUBG has been plagued by the most annoying bugs I have ever experinced. The game is being ruined by Chinese hackers ""lag switchers"" and high pingers who can shoot you around corners. The lag is so bad that you can feel the game stuttering every half minute. If you don't believe me just look at how the plane warps forward 10 meters every now and then. Then you have people who have hacks that give their guns no recoil. To make things worse PUBG corp is totally ok with players downloading third party software that can be used to make the footsteps of other players much more audible on their end which is analogous to ""legalizing"" a specific type of hack.This game also has some incredibly annoyinh features soo bad that they should be considered glitches except that they ain't (because they are actual game features). For instance the parachutes are actual rigid collidable objects that are capable of getting you stuck on any building (clearly none of the devs have played Battlefield 3 a 2011 game that has working parachutes). So in summary your character will have their parachute stuck on some wall while a lucky a lucky player who wasn't affected by this issue shoots you in the d!ck with a shotgun. When throwing grenades lets say you initially aimed at some point but decide to change the point you are aiming at in the middle of the throw. The grenade will go towards the original direction (I killed at teammate because of this one time I first looked at him after pulling the pin then attempted to look at the actual enemy in vain). Also grenades do not inherit the momentum due to your character's movement (or at least this is not as noticeable as in CS GO). Then there is the holstering mechanic which makes your character holster their weapon whenever their close to a wall. This feature can simply not coexist well with a leaning mechanic because everytime that you try to shoot from cover by leaning and moving slightly your character will holster their DP 28 and completely block your vision resulting in your opponent being able to actually see their target (whereas you can't). Long story short the game does its absolute best to $hit on you.Then you have absolutely completelly totally BS red zones which literally do not contribute anything meaningful to game rather the add a random chance that you just die for no reason (Like if the hackers weren't enough). Then you have the fact that AR's are still OP and that sniper rifles are still OP. Shotguns are broken AF. Pistols are simply not AR's. The only viable melee weapon is the pan the machete sickle and crowbar are just a prank. Btw lets agree that the crowbar is a straight rip off from Half Life's signature melee weapon (just for giggles and lols).",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

You are entirely entitled to your own opinion and suggestions are always welcome.First off I must say that these types of games live and die by their community YOU CANNOT HAVE A WORKING BATTLE ROYALE IF YOU CAN'T KEEP THE PLAYERS ENTERTAINED. As with the situation currently with the OCE servers have little or no players in them i recommend a buyers beware for people that are planning to buy and play this game if you are in Australia or New Zealand. That being said i came back to this game after a few months to see how it was doing and what the fuss was about topping the steam stats for quite a while now. Turns out my expectations of vast improvement and major change have turned into a massive dissapointment. First off let me say that i'm not a big fan of the battle royale genre (as most of my games mostly centre around competitive fps and the like) however through my experience of what was left of this game on OCE servers (don't really want to go to another server to experience 300+ ping) was a trainwreck of a game with very little change that i could notice from the early access version. With the long que times of up to 10 minutes long to get a single game with 4 10 players into it.The changes i noticed more guns (yay i guess) sound improvement? (stills sounds terrible) climbing seems smoother A ""testing island"" (not single player though) Better main menu screen? (now infested with buy menus for cosmetic items) New maps? (too bad i can't stand the 10 min que timers)Despite changes to the game i still find it quite buggy vehicles will sometime phase through bridges and explode vehicles will sometimes fly... and explode character will do some weird glitches in the terrainAnd now the section where i would rant but no one will probably be bothered reading entire paragraphs so here are some dot points more loot boxes that require keys to open! DID I MENTION NO ONE PLAYS THIS ON OCE ANYMORE? Sound is still garbage Fix PUBG seems like a joke (even Operation Health for seige was even more proffesional than this) Still a glitchy mess Focus on the cosmetics rather than the gameplay i see? Servers still kinda laggyin summary i cannot recommend this game currently in this state for players in OCE.

7/15/2017,0,0,322,FALSE,Not Recommended,"So I reviewed the game in july 16th when I first got the game. Now that the excitement has worn off let me tell you honestly what I think of this game.IT SHOULD NOT BE ON FULL RELEASE.Why you may ask ? For 4 simple reasons.1)GLITCHES2)HACKERS 3)TEAMKILLING4)BOREDOMSo lets start with the glitches.They are WAAAY to many.You get a motorbike go above 100km/s on a road and suddenly a MAGICAL INVISIBLE BUMP flips your bike and kills you.Another example is looting and not being able to pick up the item.These are just some of the glitches. If you buy the game you will deal with them A LOT and it WILL be frustrating.Now lets talk about hackers.You can find at least one in every other game.You will spend 20 mins of your life looting just for a hacker to come and shoot in the air and insta kill you.Bluehole said they would deal with this problem but they did NOTHING. They just rushed the game to full release put out a new map and also gave you 2 new lootcrates that NOONE ASKED FOR.Similar to the glitches the hackers are something you will have to deal with on the daily.Next are the toxic teamkillers.You find them less often but they are still annoying.You got some good loot and you dont want to give it to that 4 year old russian teammate of yours.GG my friend you are already DEAD. Another example is your teammate leaving a squad or a duo at the start of the game. But to this there are 2 solutions.Either play alone which is more boring than watching paint dry or go to discord. I have met some great people there.And to end this review I want to talk about boredom.A fellow reviewer described this better than I ever could. Here it is "" It starts off incredibly fun at first and will give you an insane rush in your first few matches. Winning your first match is a feeling that few things can compare too. But I'm going to tell you now once the honeymoon phase wears off this game QUICKLY stops being fun and you'll begin to notice just how awful the quality of it is.""So I give PUBG a solid 5/10 for the RARE fun times i have had and that I've made approximately 25 euros off of selling crates.All in all if you want to spent 30$ for a game that will make you rage on the first week do it.But I guarantee that your first week will be awesome.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

6/27/2018,0,0,253,FALSE,Not Recommended,With 220 hours on this game I think I am somewhat able to give a review on this game.Overall I personaly enjoy this game a lot. but just because i enjoy this game that doesnt mean that it's a good game. Bluehole in my opinion has taken some questionable and bad choices on the game. here are some of the flaws of Bluehole and what they did to this game.Examples Battle pass with a broken system. Why am I getting items that I am going to end up getting taken away? Battle pass missions are extremly boring. Its gotting to the point of killing my own teamates to revive them. Doesnt know how to deal with hacking. (yea i know region lock will help but I think getting a better anti cheat system will have the same affect and benifet the game.) Adds content instead of fixing the game. Bluehole pretty much put duct tape over the mouth of the community. For some reason they took out map select. Desperatly calls out fortnite for copying unironically.In conclusion I really enjoy this game and i think this game can potentially be better then what it is. If only bluehole can pull a u turn and fix up the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Vehicles roll for little to no reason at times... from hitting glitchy ground sections. Guns are very inaccurate in full auto mode only semi auto firing mode is worth using. The bullet lead and drop is different to any other game you have ever played and feels wrong... you shoot way too far in front of people to hit them with bullet travel times of 3 5seconds.This game is only popular as it is the first DAYZ style survival game to release on consoles and consoles are the majority of the gaming market.

Constant stutters and frame drops make the game unplayable at times. Quite often I find my teammates in the plane but I'm not since the game hasn't loaded for me yet. Some textures don't load until a minute after I've dropped. Just before writing this review a played a match with my friend where it wouldn't let me pick anything up. I could walk around I saw my friend picking stuff up. Turns out my character was still in the plane. This wasn't due to my internet since I had no lag while walking around and watching my friend.

I'll be peeking behind a tree then watch my death cam and see that on their screen I was standing beside the tree in full visibility. Absolute crap.EDIT They dropped their lawsuits. Thank you. Shouldn't have been filed in the first place. Absolutely crap.Game needs optimizations. I have recordings of people killing me by shooting at the ground. De sync is freaking horrible. I've had people look straight into the sky and shoot and I died. Wasn't even in their sight. Once FIX PUBG campaign is complete I'll play and see if the game is worth giving a thumbs up.ORIGINAL Come on now. Filing a lawsuit against another company that made a similar game? Talk about anti competitive practices. That's stupid. I'll never support a game company that files lawsuits against other developers because they made something similar.I guess in this case the makers of the Battle Royale movies should file a lawsuit against you right? Since you obviously copied their work.Or maybe the creators of Arma should sue you since you took concepts content etc directly from their game. You made a one hit freaking wonder and have the audacity to go after other game developers that try to make something similar.Grow a pair and make quality content rather than just trying to sue your competition.

But what was supposed to be unique was their support for modding. I remember that years ago it was said that PUBG would be focused on modding making it very easy for the comunity to write their owns mods. Which I havent even seen yet(?). Regardless the networking funcitonality is horrible. Absolutely 0 support for SLI you just get a buggy menu and in game graphics glitches if you try. You really have to ask yourself what the santaclaus is the project manager is doing? Why on earth can they not fix their networking? why is it that with a new update an old bug returns? or something else entirely gets completely... ruined?This game is not something you would see in a E sport as it does not come down to skill.

1/18/2018,0,0,392,FALSE,Not Recommended,This game is fun and I enjoy it but it is not worth the money I payed for it. It's basically a full priced game for a beta that is not 100% yet. I usually play squad and the reviews about hackers I never saw until one day I hopped onto duo and solo. I played a few games and oh my god it was bad. 5 games in straight I watch the replay of someone shooting in the air with a shotgun and instantly killing me. A little sadness later I joined a duo I got 3 kills even when my teammate quit in the plane. Long story short some with a m416 and a 4x shot at a metal wall across the map and killed me.

Personally this is not a game i would play to have fun. On the other hand if i ever feel the need to punishing myself i'll play four hours straight without getting more than a few kills.Here is why i feel it's so tideous 1. Without 16Gb ram you are garuanteed to eventually run into some huge lag spikes. If you're one of us unfortunate souls you won't be able to render the buildings for the first 1 2 ish minutes. One perk with this tho is that you can kinda walk throu walls and shoot. You'll get stuck tho.2. You want to practice your aim? Sure! Go ahead. Currently the only way to actually get a bit better is to play play play! That means going to hours and hours (appearantly 300+) while scavenging a lvl three helmet and west. If you're so unfortunate to go meet a dude still with a shotgun he'll kill you point blank. You know all that loot? Yeah good wasn't it?3.Either i'm just not ment to be an ""aiming guy"" or there's something wrong with my game. More than once have i had a clear headshot calculated the distance with the lines zeroed inn triangulated all possible exits but still missed. Now hopefully i'm just not that good at shooters but i'm starting to think that 300 hours without ANY kind of result might have other causes than my terrible reactions and appearantly uneven mouse movements.4. You'll get mad. Why do you think i wrote this review? I just sat up til 03 30 to look through a recording of my own death again and again. I was trying to find out where my shots had landed when i suddenly found out that either the recordings are f ed up (which has been proven multiple times) oooor the game sometimes won't allow you to shoot or smthn idk * *On the other hand if you really (and i mean R E A L L Y) just want to play it for fun (whatever that is) squad can sometimes prove to be quite amusing. Just don't expect much of it.To summarise I do not recomend buyng PUBG if you plan to have fun and you ain't got le's Computes. If you've got the PC then great! Good for you! But still prepare to be served hot juicy t from time to time.

12/28/2017,0,0,402,FALSE,Not Recommended,Since the 1.0 update there has been countless Chinese players on the North American servers. Their astronomically high ping combined with their inability to speak English leads to a very hard time when attempting to get a win or match with random people. I have been playing this game since a week after its release and i have mostly enjoyed the gameplay. There are some times in which I hear my friends complain about lag even more than I do and on higher end systems with better internet. This game is worth the buy if you have 1 3 other people to constantly play with but if you are thinking of matching with anybody that you dont know or just playing solo this game is not for you. You will experience parts in which you know you hit the person and it doesn't register and other times when you see people skipping around corners with very choppy movements. Don't buy this game.

Even with the enjoyable gameplay the consistent updates and the fun I had with this game I cannot give this game a positive review the developers are huge on banning people for the benefit of streamers they put advertisements into chinese servers instead of fixing up their local servers and they have failed to implemented much wanted and needed to the game such as vaulting offering no alternative.

Weapon Issues Every fight full auto jams after a few rounds and you have to take your finger off the mouse to reset (lag or glitching idk happens on other modes too). Impossible to gauge half of my sniper shots over 500m as terrain texture and depth doesn't vary same goes for foliage rock and tree cover. The fact that you can't seperate lean + ADS from changing your weapon hand in third person gets you killed and drives you batshit too. Bullet loops for your stock would serve a much better role of being a tactical reloading mod for sohtgun and bolt action rifles chambering single cartridges at a time.Community Issues My experience with the community is they fit into 3 main categories Casual gamers who don't know how to reload their gun somewhat experienced juvenile delinquents of millenial or H1Z1/ArmaModded/CoD backgrounds and absolute monsters from the Rust/GenXCoD/ArmaSquad/Squad/TacticalShooter crowd. It can drive someone to smash their monitor (whoops P) when they're constantly put with the latter types and vice versa please consider a skill based ranking system for everyone's sake Bluemoon. Regardless of category please don't make the community worse by exiting to lobby during flight turn off your mic or lone wolfing it like a (on that note please change chance base solo/semi squad queing in duos and squads to a checklist option deactivated by default).Overall game issues There is no overall purpose to the game from the onset the premise is so casual and yet the gameplay is so serious and replayable. Community market items aren't valuable (outside of the imfamous and pointless preorder) due to their rarity so your time is wasted on that front. I wish there was a way in game to search for discord communities and individuals when you wanna play seriously or for competitive tornament play with a way to register a persistent clan and their respective squads for match making. So the gameplay mechanics are remarkably versatile yet the mods being developed for custom servers are remarkably facepalm. Adding full ruleset and asset modding would be a massive benefit to your modding community. Finally please consider a Virtual Reality standalone launcher or custom modded option for those that want an Onward style battle royale experience. I've uninstalled for now as I can't be bothered with the existing issues but i'll keep an eye on your progress.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
11/24/2017,0,0,208,TRUE,Not Recommended,When I first bought the game I thought it was amazing. It had (fun) fighting mechanics tons of loot and more. But as I went on I noticed the repition of the game. Almost every game was the same. Not to mention the worst mechanic in the entire game the red zone. It is a mystery why this is even in the game considering it is complete luck and no skill whatsoever. Dont even get me started on the game's anti cheat. There are cheaters in 1/2 games at least for me. Overall the game is good for the first 4 days after that it dies.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
1/3/2018,0,0,758,FALSE,Not Recommended,"After all this time in open beta they ""release"" a game that is still so full of frustrating bugs and glitches it's borderline unplayable. Spend 20 minutes looting chasing the safe zone circle. Then you finally find an opponent to fight and try to lob a grenade through his window instead as soon as the grenade leaves your hands the game freezes up and crashes to desktop. How on earth do bugs like this fall through the cracks???Or you are waiting at the starting zone for the timer to tick down and the plane to appear. As soon as it does the game glitches out puts your character straight back into the starting zone but unable to move or act. Not to mention the other plentiful random crashes and connection issues that are running rampant.Until these major game breaking problems are resolved this game is not worth a cent. Do not give these Developers at Blue Balls any more money until they deliver on a game that is worth playing.Yes this review is posted in the heat of the moment but that does not diminish the severity of the bugs that are still very much present in the game in its current 1.0 release state.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

With the way they're releasing updates and ""optimizing"" this game it's like they haven't played it or been watching to see how the game is being played.

7/2/2017,0,0,582,FALSE,Not Recommended,"CONS Updates don't have a proper level of testing making updates a bug machine instead of fixing them. Trying over and over again the same didn't work in past to fix but they try it again after the dust without notice of such definition of insanity and lack of transparency. The objective is to find a workaround instead of a fix to every single bug of the game if possible should be the exact oposite. Horrible graphics and terrible map design map feels a lot artificial not gameplay friendly for the game style and lacks any kind of detail. No proper roadmap plan as seen the way that they implemented features like first more than 1 map and only moths after map choice for the players and considered the affects on gameplay of having more than 1 map. (Now removing some map choice again) They don't really know what to do they live day to day and predict no future at all. Has free2play economy but the game is 30$. BP previously a good reward is now worthless since now everything is locked behind a paywall of keys. Ads inside of the game of diverse PUBG Corp events. THIS IS NOT A FREE GAME! Devs don't really have any comprehension of what the game needs vs. what the community want they just do what they want and try to make the most money of that. PUBG(the guy) should as numerous of time said atomic level bull just making bad PR for the game however its statments just show how really out of reallity Bluehole is at the moment. Introducing Event Pass that offers no value compared with similiar offers of other publishers. Claim that ""they"" own the entire Genre of BattleRoyal and that others have copied them weeks later they copy DLC ""pass"" mechanics as the same way they acussed other of copy there genre.PROS Unfortunately there isn't still ANY game that offers a TRUE BR experience without building or magic bull so you are pretty much force into this pile of crap because is still to be found a true replacement to PUBG.TLDR You are force into this game because there isn't any other game that offers similiar experince if there is such thing the probability is that is a better game and you should play that instead of this money grab trap with a delusional dev team that obviously lives in another reallity.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

4/1/2018,0,0,635,FALSE,Not Recommended,This game should've never left beta.1. Servers are still ridiculously bad for a shooter. Constant desync and lag especially in the first 10 minutes of the game. Tickrates under 10 (yes ten!) are nothing special. You'll be lucky if you get 30 after 10 15 minutes into the game. 2. It's getting worse instead of better with every patch. If you're looking for a competitive shooter don't play this game. If you don't care about getting killed 1 2 seconds after being behind cover then have fun with it.3. There are still a million bugs and glitches. E.g. your scope randomly switches to another reticle and color.4. You're stuck a lot. Mountain terrain is the worst. There is no indicator that shows you whether or not you can e.g. climb/run on rocks/certain mountain terrain etc.5. Vehicle physics is a joke. You're still randomly dying from bikes falling over for no reason. Your vehicle will run into tiny objects you can't see and you'll spin around maybe even taking damage.6. I've got a i7 8700k and a GTX 1080ti and even I have problems maintaining FPS above 100. I use custom settings that should theoretically help with FPS but it's still nowhere near a decently optimized game especially when builings are around.I could go on forever. I have 620h in this game (including beta) so I can't complain that I didn't get enough bang for my bucks but this game is just such a sad story. It had so much potential. Sadly the devs are not willing/able to provide the improvements they promised. I fear that this game is dead in 1 year and this game won't ever come to a point I would consider a finished game that is truely e sports ready.Don't be fooled by all the e sports stuff btw. Nobody is signing up for this. At least no pro players/teams. There is a reason for that. It is NOT fit for e sports and it probably never will be no matter how much money they push into promoting is as such.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

6/6/2018,0,0,324,FALSE,Not Recommended,"When the game was released it was very popular. Really i love this game. At that time it was understandable to encounter bugs even the most unknown and random bugs that costs your life. It was also understandable to see bad optimization in the game. It was understandable since it was in early access. More than that crates were used to have such high prices and in my opinion it was easier to gain BP to buy crates. I would also like to thank you for giving such an enjoyable gaming battle royale experience and for adding FPP servers in SEA. Even until now i am still enjoying the game.But Is this game still in early access? Nope.In addition they added keys to open crates what the ****? Are you planning to slowly kill this game like the most popular valve's shooter did? Alright you might be better for still adding contents such as new maps and guns but are you aiming for that? To be honest we players or at least me do not give a **** about skins. Rather than adding some unimportant content that makes us download a huge amount of updates with no significant nor noticeable changes this game should be more focused on improving their game optimization. I would not lie even tencent games optimize the game better than you in PUBG mobile some of my friends would also agree with that. Fix your servers i often get ""servers are too busy"" note while restarting lobby or starting the game. Somehow please do something to reduce me and my friends pressing restart lobby every time we want to play. Your servers sometimes (25% 50% of my playtime) is laggy as ****. I fully understand the problem also relies on my internet connection but i am not the only one who complain about this issue. Fix yout hitregs fix sound mechanics as for now it is kinda unrealistic on how you make a sound when vaulting and not making sound while jumping from the same height fix vaulting as well as i usually encounter some windows that should be vaultable but not Fix vehicle mechanics as sometimes it is not realistic kinda contradicts to law of physics (lol) and fix your map as well as i still find some invinsible objects in the way. Somehow i found some teleporters for whatever the reason is. So far i have not faced with cheaters but i hope you are keep improving the anticheat also please fix the lobby as sometimes i need to wait around 3 minutes for my character to ready after pressing ready button and i still have some or probably many unpleasant problems that might be missed during writing this review.Do not get me wrong i still enjoy this game despite rages on the backstage. But please fix those whole problems and i am certain this game would be enjoyable. So is this game worth buying? As for now if you do not mind with problems i have stated above then go ahead.

7/5/2018,0,0,431,FALSE,Not Recommended,This game is extremely fun when playing with friends and not taking it seriously. I have had a lot of good moments playing this game but over time the issues with it start to get very frustrating. The biggest for me is the desync in combat that makes it so I have no desire to ever try to play this game competetively. One of the developers biggest mistakes was adding a death cam so the players could see just how bad the desync is. I would not reccomend this game unless you are patient don't care if you die from desync issues and have a group of friends to play squads with. If you are in NA expect random 3 4 hour updates during peak hours that will make you consider why you ever spent 400 hours on this game. Also if you want any of the rare cosmetics good luck getting them without spending money. The developers are starting to seem like they care more about getting money through loot crates and a battle pass than they do about fixing issues the community has been complaining about since release. Half the time the UI doesn't even work properly and you constantly have to refresh your lobby or reboot your game.

Why should a game that you pay $30 for make you pay more for keys to open a crate for a chance to get an item. That's bad business practice and it shows that they just want more money.

3/21/2018,0,0,490,FALSE,Not Recommended,After many MANY hours I decided to finally review this game. In pro con thing...(sorry if I make mistakes english isnt my first language. JUMP TO THE END IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE CONCLUSION THERE IS A LOT TO READ IF NOT Pro's You can spend many hours on this. It is very addictive especially with friends.Very easy to lear but hard to master. Which makes it better the more you advance.Good Co op with friends. Teamwork is essential and is very rewarding and fun. And for laughes. 2 Maps with kinda different playstyle which gives you more gameplay and opportunities Many features and weapons which let you experiment and have guns. Overall good ish graphics. But with their budget they can do better. Two maps on the way. Which means the dev's are still working on this game. Quite often bug fixes. But not enough.Cons Many MANY MANY cheaters on this game. They try to ban them all and I get it's hard but there are still so many.You may experience a few games in a row with hackers which really sucks.Many small bugs nothing to bad but its really annoying that they dont fix them (rocks you can see through and walk in them and walls like that and stuff)Glitches with vehicles TOO MANY TIMES I have died from the vehicle deciding it wants to flip for no reason or crash with the air which results with dying. Which is really annoying especially if its in the late game.not enough updates! since I started playing which was soon after the launch of the game The only thing they added was ONE new map and some weapons and vehicles. Most of them going into the airdrop. They really can do many things with their budget but I fell they are wasting it on things we dont really need or want. Such as crates or Flare guns to the test server. (who wants that??). They do noteven add GAME MODES such as 50V50 or Zombies (as promised in the last E3 if I remember correctly) Which I was really waiting for.Player base. Pubg's community is pretty good. But it is starting to get smaller (Because of most of the thing I mentioned before and more) Including 4 of my friends and me too (partially)________________________________________________________________________________PUBG VS FORNITE the big questionI think overall Pubg is a better and more enjoyable game. There is more tactics and more skill ( i think so at least) needed for the game. Which makes it more challening and more fun. Pubg also has two maps and more vehicles and weapons that change with attachements and everyhing that comes with that. BUT Fortnite keep adding to their game. Almost every week there is a new gamemode and some new weapons here and there. Which keeps your interest there and makes it fun every week. also after all the hackers in pubg sometimes what you want to do is just play some fortnite A game with almost ZERO hackers.I think if you like more teamwork and tactics. With realistic graphics and weapons and dont rage easily at a game. Then pubg is the choice for you. But if you like to relax with friends and troll a bit and have here and there some fun without being too focused on the game. Then you should go to fortnite.Is it worth the price? No I dont htink so in it's current state. But if they do a decent sale or you know a decent place you can get it for cheaper. and have friends to play with. It's a very fun game.You should though watch some gameplay and maybe play the mobile version so you can get a grasp of what the game is like.In conclusion Pubg is a fun game but still has a lot of work to go through. It is worth a try but I think for this price you can surely get something better.Sorry for the long review. Hope this helps. ),PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

10/30/2017,0,0,236,FALSE,Not Recommended,The concept for this game is fantastic It's an extremely addicting challenge to fight 99 other players to attempt to be the last one standing. The Negative review comes from the game itself. For about a week you can look past the glaring flaws and imperfections and indulge in pure silly fun either with friends or without but once you start getting into the game a bit more and start actively seeking wins the flaws become a lot more frustrating. From getting killed by someone who is already rounded a corner a good 2 seconds ago to killing yourself by having a vehicle you're driving launch into orbit and drop you to your death or even just being flatout killed by someone using hacks to see your model through objects across the map and aimbot you dead with a headshot PUBG just becomes one infuriating loss after the next. I don't expect to win every single game nor should anyone but deaths rarely feel like it's 100% on you. Most games leave you with a bitter feeling of being robbed of a kill from problems like your character putting your gun down because you nudged too close to cover while in a firefight or desync causing the player you see yourself loading hundreds of bullets into to flank and one shot you while you're too busy shooting at his doppelgänger.I cannot recommend this game to anyone in it's current state. It's playable yes but the amount of frustration and disappointment that comes from how poorly optimized and how little progress is being made to correct issues that have been in the game since it's EA launch aren't worth it.If the devs get off their and address issues that have been plaguing the game for months instead of doing like adding microtransactions and working on meeting some arbitrary release date instead of meaningful milepoints in the game's development I'll change my mind but I honestly don't see that happening any time soon.EDIT The game's not in EA anymore still runs like it is. Still isn't very much fun to play outside of the 1% of the match you spend killing someone compared to the 99% of running. Still don't recommend it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

But things just changed. Now it is nothing but lag lag and nothing BUT lag. I truned my settings to Low and that didn't make one bit of difference. I installed CPUCores and that didn't make any difference. It actually made the game worse and more laggy. After the last update the lag has made the game basically useless for me. I have Intel i7 GeForce GTX 980 16GB RAM WIN 10 and I even tried using CPUCores wich didn't help one bit. I am somewhat familiar with speeding up my PC since I have been a PC repair tech for the last 20 years. For Example I used to be able to kill people easily with punching NOT anymore. Today I landed at the same time as this other guy I started chasing him trying to punch him not once I was able to make contact he was running away from me the hole time and I never saw him having a chance to pickup any weapons. It was lagging so bad that at one time I saw him outside of the building when we were both inside of the building. He cosntantly was skipping away from me and making distance then he turned around and pulled out a rifle and killed me.

FU PUBG or MICROSOFT since it is going to console by next year.I like the came so far but it definitely has its issues. First I would have to say knowing that they are in early access and still going to impliment a microtransaction feature is STUPID!!! You will only lose your original fan base and keep the ones that either don't mind paying to get their ""cool stuff"" then they when they spent $2.50 on some bogus stuff. Next seems like for the first 30 seconds of landing you have to deal with major lag. noticeable if you go into a house/building and try to interact with objects within that period Last thing it is defintely way to easy to camp your way to top 10 and then pop out of the house to kill the final dude that probably had to run around the whole game to get into the 'safe zone'. I know this because I myself have been on both sides of the spectrum. Pros best battle royal to date IMO 100 players is the perfect amount to make it face paced but doesnt feel like you are in a huge war.Cons Camping Simulator Waaaaaay too many pistol/shotguns Not enough M16 AKM M24 etc.Conclusion Ill still end up playing this game because GTA V has gone to and CSGO has gotten old so ill play this til another game comes out or if the microtransactions on the game.

All of my friends had stopped playing it and they were the only reason I had continued to play this game after my initial negative review. It can honestly be a fun time with friends (by fun I mean humorous) but in my opinion solo is just pointless. Like everyone else on here I've played a lot of shooters. Almost never through all the years that I've played games like CounterStrike Call of Duty Overwatch and even Battlefield (except for 4 which was a mess for a while) have I felt like the game itself was consistently screwing me or somebody else over in a match. But PUBG does. I'm not even talking about when it's me doing the dying. Sometimes I land kills where I'm like ""Yeah that was stupid."" I'm not an expert on desync and lag and whatnot especially when it's not the kind that's right in your face but something makes this game incredibly inconsistent each time I play. The guns never feel like they are doing the same thing twice. And there seems to be a lot updates but they don't feel like they're changing anything on more than a cosmetic level. It's a shame because I've played a few Royale games now and I know I like this genre and I like the style of PUBG the best which is why I've put so many hours in.

Before release I probably encountered one or two in an entire night of playing (anywhere from 15 30 matches). Now (and this is not an exaggeration) over half the matches my friends and I play have hackers in them. Aim assist is a HUGE problem in this game. I have encountered multiple scenarios where I can move on the other side of a hill from a hacker (obviously not even close to being in his line of sight) and watch the bullets land at head level on the other side of the hill on full auto. Just tonight I was doing duos with a buddy and in the six matches we played we were killed by hackers in four of them (two of which we were down to 4 remaining). This creates an extremely unsatisfying and disappointing experience. Bluehole needs to get its act together on stopping these hackers or they'll end up with a game that only cheaters play.

There used to be funky physics cars that would crash and fly through the air which was gotten rid of. Instead of are either glued to the ground or roll for an eternity.The team apparently has no idea how to balance their weapons. For a time the M4 was the objectively best weapon for a long time and instead of tuning it down a little everything got nerfed so that the vector is considered the best weapon for close medium range.But my by far biggest complaint is the absence of any kind of change in gameplay. The last gameplay update was in December 2017 when vaulting got released. Vaulting is still badly animated and buggy as hell. Pros still prefer bumping into a window to simulate crouch jumping. Atleast at the beginning the ridiculousness was fun but they removed the weird fun mechanics and now it's either running or sitting simulator.You wonder why a kids game like Fortnite is doing so well?

The amount of lag after dropping in somewhere is just disgusting and is only getting worse with the increasing amount of players getting the game (which doesn't make sense because it's only 100 players per server so why does the over all volume of the game effect the individual server? Maybe it's time for a server upgrade).2.) Hackers own this game right now (They are working on it but this doesn't take away from the relevance)3.) Your client will crash whenever it feels like it.4.) If someone's ping is just one point lower than yours they become Angelina Jolie from Wanted and curve bullets around any obstacle so don't even bother getting behind cover.5.)

I really enjoyed it despite all the glitches and saw that it was constantly getting better. And then i was BANNED for no reason. I'm sure they had a reason but refused to share it with me. They said i was cheating. Which is strange... 359 hours in and i won the game once solo and maybe twice in squad. I'm not very good but i enjoyed playing it and watching wife learn WASD and all that. I appealed ban and they said they reviewed it and truly beleive i was cheating. But didn't say how. .40 K D ratio .10 head shots. just doesn't make sense. So they essentially stole 37 dollars from me. I appreciate that hacking was a huge problem for a while but i guess they decided to err on the side of caution and handed out PERMANENT BANS.

9/17/2017,0,0,10,TRUE,Not Recommended,Personally I find this game sort of boring (7 hours and I feel like I have to make myself play it.) I got it because it's wildly popular and I design games myself so maybe I'm not strictly the target audience but let me elaborate.So I hear a lot of people turned off by the game because it's a shooter. When I first picked up the game and was impressed to be in the top 50% I thought that maybe that wasn't true because you can make it pretty far through wits and strategy.Here's the thing though. The game literally monentarily reward killing people and you are only going to get that credit if you shoot someone. There is no other way to outplay someone. Sure you can have the highground better items and even a car but to take someone out you are going to have to kill them and that almost always means playing the game like a first person shooter.Now personally I think shooters are sort of a played out genre. I really enjoy the early stages of the game where you plan out your route try to get as much loot while taking as few risks as possible but the map shrinks. That means that no matter how successfully you outmanuvered others in the early stage of the game winning means that you are going to end up in a tiny circle in a firefight. To me that sounds more like losing because it's the part of the game I least enjoy.I think that the survival elements of this game the circle contracting the design of the map and even the way items spawn are excellent and interesting but to conclude I just don't enjoy the actual gameplay when it gets to what the game is really about.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Insanely huge playerbase? Check . Loads of support from streamers/youtubers? Check . And man don't even get me started on the amount of suggestions for gameplay improvements they've recieved it was pure madness (most of them never to be implemented unfortunately). The community was thriving and willing to give the developers every bit of help they could. Bluehole however didn't care. They opted for adding new crates/keys/skins/etc. instead of actually fixing the game (it's not early acces anymore though it runs as if it was) and getting rid of all the bugs and issues (which trust me are plentiful).

One patch will fix 10 things while breaking 20 more the desync ping netcode is not going to get better. If they havent fixed it yet how do you expect them to get help from the game engine design team they are now suing. You know what flops around? A dying fish gasping for air. That is this game. A dying fish flopping around on the beach. I have played 1 000 hours. I have tried to have fun and EVERY SINGLE TIME said yep F this game. Only to try it again hours later or days later. 100's of millions of dollars earned months and months of time to spend some of that making the game a better expirience. Still nothing. Gun skins emotes new maps that take almost 6 months to develope. All to avoid fixing the onkly point his game ever had to shoot someone else with a gun and for that bullet to impact them as intended and to do dameage and kill that person. Its all RNG and latency. So you end up firing a M24 at a persons head 3 times. hitting him twice with a 4 x scope from 250m only to have him spin find you take aim with a red dotted KAR98 and blow your head off in one F'ing shot. Im over it. Done. The Bluehole vs Epic lawsuit is a suicide attempt so they can move on with no excusses from a game they know cant be fixed. They have proven they do not know how to fix this game. Plain and simple.I am having fun playing Ring of Elysium. It does what PUBG tries to do. Its pretty back to basics as far as being the same BR model with TPP and terrible Asian servers for a US player. But I think things will come around. And it offers me the ability to still be addicted to BR style games without having to jump into a land where you can build walls while you run around and shoot candy canes and pompoms at 12 year olds. Fortnite is a kids game and makes no sense in a Realistic Battle Royal simulation. RoE is pretty much PUBG without the FPP skins and netcode issues. Even playing from NA. Do not buy this game.

3/16/2018,0,0,644,FALSE,Not Recommended,"Bought this sh it like 10 months ago and for now I can easily say that do not buy it.The first point is optimization. It su cks a lot. There is no fuc kin difference between pubg may 2017 and pubg march 2018. Maybe middle fps is around 60 but its still too low for online shooter(especially for the first person which I am only playing). Still drops to 40 in big cities sometimes in open space sorry Bluehole that I dont have PC with 2x 1080ti. And for sure crashes even with SSD good enough.The second point is cheaters. Every fuc kin update saying that ""we are improving our anticheat system"".Okay for sure some of cheaters are really got banned but what percent of them? Why the fu ck am I seeing cheaters in every 2 3 games?Is this your improve?The third point is gameplay. What tickrate does this idiotta game have? I think the number is near 0. Occasionally you can't kill a man with no vest in 3 4 bullets with m4/scar/ak. You can't kill the guy with 2 armor in 6 bullets but he does it in 3 bullets to your 2 armor. Really? About sniper rifles is separate history I would better keep silent. So maybe ballistics is good? No it's more terrible than situation with tickrate. What are you trying to do Bluehole? Make ballistics like in Arma 3? So I have got some sad news for you. I see the guy in 100 metres in front of me so why the fu ck I need to shoot ahead of his running trajectory like 1 2 centimeters from the screen of my monitor? Do you think that m4 bullet has 1 meter per hour speed? In last season my k/d was like 6 8 but anyway I can't get used to that bullsh it tickrate and shooting. If you can't make ballistics like in Arma 3 so return old pubg ballistics it was much better and nicer. First person viewmodel is so stupid it feels like my height is 120 cm.The fourth point is PLEASE PROTECT EUROPEAN SERVERS FROM FUC KIN CHINESE PEOPLE. They are lagging as fu ck if there is a chinese guy for sure you are exactly dead cuz they got some teleport skills . Or is that secret chinese season pass for pubg which giving them teleport ultimate?The fifth point is loot. I won't tell a lot just pay attention for one thing. You can easilly loot 2 3 big houses and you will find a lot clothes with pistol.So much problems and what is developer doing?

Textures are now loaded correctly but obviously lag could be a bigger problem...There is also many more bugs that are still happening. Riding motorbike and flipping it on straight road vaulting and climbing not working time to time and many more. Plus let's not speak about lauch of the game... They kind of delayed lauch for next 30 hours and forget to mention it until they updated steam...Another problem is server are just too BUSY! There are just moments you can't even log in. Let's wrap this up... Be a smart cookie do not support this game until they fix it...,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

10/26/2017,0,0,362,FALSE,Not Recommended,"Really tried to like this game since it offers many great squad gameplay moments. Aside the battle royale core it also absorbs some of the elements of survival games like DayZ which went down the sh*tter so it's nice to have a substitute. Looting choosing and sharing equipment adapting to the situation hunting the most precious virtual prey Humans.After over 130 hours playtime I can't find anything to learn anymore and the design and technical shortcomings of the game become obvious. My skill mastering the clunky gunplay stagnates and the constant death to bad RNG and the technical issues of the game made me quit. It's was still a good value for the money though and therefore I recommend the game if you get it cheap. Just don't listen to all the fanboy fcks out there hyping it as the holy grail. It's a stagnating early access battle royale shooter which did enough good to become streamers favourite. Short version c 3The game is not as perfect as all the hyped fanboys and streamers make it seem to be. Design problems many not unknown to developers and shooter players especially if used to play other third person shooters and battle royale games. Bad technical optimisation and many basic technical issues not fixed yet.Gameplaywise easier to handle than DayZ or Arma when it comes to the inventory system and gunplay but still very clunky for a shooter. The loot system and very punishing zone system mix in a high amount of RNG which often kills the fun especially in the endgame.Looking at the development status it currently looks to become another abandoned early access game which did not change much since it's ""Alpha"" release. Prepare to get milked by microtransactions. Long version c 3Good + Nice inventory system. Clear layout and smooth to use while moving over lootpiles or fallen players.+ The equipment choice seems well thought out with its 3 Tier armor system and many weapon types.+ Weapons are sharing few types of ammo and many attachments so adapting to new guns works smoothly and does not require too much inventory time.+ Many attachments can be ommited. Many ""raw"" weapons are in the right hands fine as they come.+ Attachments increase usefullness of a weapon over the course of a match especially scopes which enable spotting and long range engagements.+ Gunplay is overall challenging and has some elements you don't expect from a casual game e.g. bullet drop (significant) recoil no markers on enemies.Technical bullsh*tt Cheaters. Some quite obvious (headshotting everybody over half the map). The main menu is not updating anything correctly to show the actual status of stuff (buttons friendlist etc.) with the sad manual (!) refresh buttons everywhere telling us that the devs are very much aware of it since release. Being tabbed out the game while starting a match? Nope does bug out. Random memory exceptions when closing or starting the game. Broken explosion sounds (Red Zone artillery and grenades) Smoke grenades can drop fps massively. Slow and primitive loading/unloading of objects and their detail levels. Can even lead to death when landing near enemies (e.g. by getting stuck for a short time after landing on a rooftop the game has yet to render as more than 5 polygons). Horrible optimisation. Mediocre graphics but still unplayable on my middle to high end system on release barely staying above 50 fps in it's current state (hardware unchanged). Unreasonable hardware demand considering the amount of players effects props etc. (Maximum of 100 players visible at the same time on screen as seen on the starting island. Barely more than 4 squads à 4 people in a typical firefight). &gt I know there are people it runs perfectly for but thats neither the majority nor the factor you measure good optimisation on. It runs on a proofen engine and does not look demanding so it should not massively drop fps for reasonable composed systems. Derpy hit recognition. Sometimes you can repeatly hit people in the head and they don't give a damn neither loosing HP nor their armor. The blood splatter effect (practically a hitmarker) is rendered locally without any confirmation by the server as it seems giving the impression of hits while there actually are none. Unclear states of models rubberbanding etc. ... you never know if the guy staring at the wall doing nothing did not already turn and started shooting at you. Especially CQC feels clunky and off (people warping into your room with few animation steps seemingly oneshotting you). Many typical hits behind cover sometimes hilariously late (e.g. already in cover starting bandaging when the hit registers).The gameplay side has some problems too Loot crates for vanity items. Cheap system preparing players for microtransactions but also directly influencing gameplay by camouflaging the player. So far many vanity items are more anti camouflage (yellow tracksuit red t shirts etc.) but it's a potential source of pay to win issues once more content is released (imagine camouflage pattern clothes). Ironsight aim is in toggle mode and can only be changed to hold mode by manually editing a config file. Third person has the typical camping around corners issue. It gets especially stupid when extrem short time to kill (shotguns uzi M416 etc.) meet easy pre aim and pre fire positions like flat rooftops doors housecorners trees etc. which the game is full of. Gameplay benefits force to play on very low graphic settings (shorter drawing distance for grass so far players can't hide players easier to spot infront of muddy textures etc.). Typical shooter problems known to mankind for ages especially in third person games. Just take a look at Arma and DayZ for gods sake and set the damn ground foliage to a usefull fixed minimum so everybody sees the same! Inbalanced weapons. Some are justified by being more rare or only avaliable in air drops (M14 M24 AWP Groza) but some are straight overpowered and readily avaliable (Mini 14 Shotguns in early game M416 vs other ARs). Weird balance of the (common) loot player hp and the armor dmg absorption Sometimes players find a shotgun in the beginning and can practically onehit everybody with it while pistols and smgs do puny dmg and practically none to high tier armor and only start working with many attachments (shifting their usefullness to mid/endgame). The only guns fun and useable throughout the course of a match are sniper and assault rifles. Fun killing blue zone circle in the endgame While causing reasonable damage in the first iterations and giving much time for players to loot and move the last stages seem rushed in a manner which puts RNG over skill. It's more about having the luck to find medical equipment and armor as well as high dps weapons than about tactical movement. Using the blue zone to trade taking damage for repositioning or getting the jump on other players moving in? Good luck when it's ticking your hp down in seconds. Healing after a nice firefight before moving to the next zone? You die because you dared fighting people for longer than 30 seconds. The smaller circles drop on your enemies position multiple times? Just run over open field and attack their turtled position... what should possibly go wrong? If you can't win the short peek a boom fights from cover to cover because of a lack of armor high alpha scoped weapons or unlucky circle positioning you're basically relying on pure RNG.!!! EDIT 27/12/2017 Version 1.0 !!!They managed to some stuff up even more (laggy as never before unprepared for obvious serverload) while improving the game very little (overall +10 15 fps for me... barely usefull when the lagg kicks in close to other players).

Developers don't seem to listen to customers. Simple Collision systems and physics systems can send you soaring through the air to your death. Playing on minimar is pretty much a running simulator. Hackers in 50% of games NO REGION LOCK! Massive issue. Can be pretty repetitive. No map choice feels like they force feed you a map they know we all hate. 3 hour downtime for updates every weeek (Always during primetime US) In my opinion its an unfinished game pushed into full production by greedy game developers who wanted profits from the console market.But the thing that will tip most players over the edge is the latest update.Not listening to the consumer increasing the zone speed early game turns this game into a sprinting simulator now. If you are unfortunate enough to not get a circle spawn you are more likely to be killed by the zone than other players. This takes the entire competitve side away from players early game.

7/13/2017,0,0,1080,TRUE,Not Recommended,This game is fun to watch. Not really much fun to play. Of course it has it's moments and can be a very enjoyable game from time to time but the majority of games are incredibly lack luster. It is a good time with friends occasionally but I would not recommend this game for someone looking for a solo experience. I have 40+ hours into the game which is a fanstic return on my investment but not all 40 hours were amazing or entertaining the majority of it was frustrating with a few occassional wins mixed in there.Solo players It is not uncommon for you to spend 20 minutes in a match gathering loot and supplies just to die to the first person you run into or die to people you never even saw and will never see shot from a direction you probably did check already. Having this happen a few times doesn't sound that bad but it can happen fairly often when you're just starting out.The shooting portion of this game are not what you would expect. It is a pretty complex and interesting system you inevitably have to learn bullet drop and leading shots things along those lines which is great but somewhat clunky right now in early access. I've had to execute teammates who DC'd (you can't reconnect to games right now) and I will aim directly at their head while standing still and it will say I did not hit them. All early access bugs I assume.The dev team is engaging and seem great so I think this game will be successful and very enjoyable down the line. It simply was not an enjoyable experence for me yet. While twitch is an amazing platform to watch and enjoy games do not think you can get this game and have the same success as the great streamers.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

To much not fixed and new added bugs ( like pixilated Sights or Mouse Malfunctions just in PUBG) and to many Cheaters. I would love to can say to new Players Come. we play PUBG but the Game has transform from a not ready but playable game to a Bug and Cheater Festival. Its a shame because I like PUBG very much and I hope that PUBG Corp. fix the Bugs soon( Or just try to make the Game playable) I give this Game a rating of 4/10 for a good Idea. a good Style but a bad Game Experience right now.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS
3/20/2018,0,0,163,FALSE,Not Recommended,"This was a great concept when it was made as a mod for Arma series. Now when it's a standalone game looks much more better then it was back then with few bugs encountered by me and those I encoutered aren't bigger deal and I didn't found those bad ones yet when you fly away with a car or any of the sorts. In short it's an really great game pretty well made weapons and gun battles and awesome concept that have been brought into an standalone version and can really get addictive and under the skin of many gamers with lots of hour pass and can't really tell when you try to be number 1 from 100 players with great gun battles for a building with maybe some loot in it the intense battle when there are just 5 players left and many other nice things that happens. But......and this is a big BUT.... But all comes after some time with an reality check when you will find lots of cheaters everywhere. I thought at first some of the cheaters dont actually cheat and players are that good....but NO. This game is really full of cheaters with autoaim speed or no recoil and after some time you will really loose interest and build frustration up. I thought maybe if I play in FPP (first person perspective) as others recommend I will not find so many of those said cheaters and I couldn't be more wrong full of them on that mode also so even if you play FPP or TPP (third person perspective) at this point it's the same thing and same amount of cheaters. I know I played just 100 hours but in that time I had so many matches with cheaters around the game so is hardly an joy for me and as I can see for many others too. If cheaters wont kill you the ones that have lag and low ping will as you try to shoot them over and over and your hits will not register but they will kill you pretty fast. So no fun with them also. The devs promised they will lock China never happened. They promised some sort of anti cheat solution but they messed that up and they removed (I actually didn't had any problems with it). They promised lots of other things and quess what?? Never happened tho they got us a nice patch some days ago but it was forgoten fast because of who? You guess it cheaters!!! Should you spend money on this game? Hell no buy something nice to your girlfriend buy some nice addon for another game from your game list buy another game but just don't buy this one until they fix the game and they get rid of all this cheaters and lag problems. If you do and start playing this one you will get frustrated as you will like it and you will play more and more and more but you will only find cheaters all around and you will hardly win a dinner. A big thumb down from me for this popular game as I've seen lots of games on a downslide and this is clearly one of them developers knows pretty well the problem and they didn't fixed it after sooooo much time and this is just a clear sign of ""We got our money so bye bye"" We have all seen this in the past in other games and now it's like a clear pattern and this one follows exactly",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS

Oh look I finally made it to the innermost section of the circle and there's a guy camping the one bush that I happened to not be looking at even though I was trying to observe all of my surroundings. Oh look he had a kar98k and it hit me in the head so despite having a level 2 helmet I instantly died. He had a level 3 helmet.Well I guess I could try again and for this new round I'll try spawning in the military base to reduce the aspect of RNG loot that's so heavily entrenched in the game. Oh what's this? 60 other tilted people decided to spawn here as well?

I don t even have to mention it this game is riddled with cheaters and it just seems that they are continually able to circumvent whatever implementations Blueballs does to try stop them. Servers are busy please reconnect later . I paid you money to be able to play the game and I expect to be able to play it whenever I feel like it excluding your patching times . If you live on PST expect patching periods to conflict with your gaming time because it naturally happens around 7PM till 10PM. They put a new loot crate in the game recently to try to milk their community for more money when there are other more PRESSING MATTERS TO ADDRESS! For the love of God why do you litter the map with useless cosmetic items? I haven t met one squad member or person throughout my entire time playing that has legitimately made an effort to grab any of the attire. They are useless and it effectively messes me up everybody in the end if they accidentally pick it up rather than the gun or ammo that they need to protect themselves! You walk/run like you have cement blocks for feet and the houses sound like they are made out of 1 ply wood. The second you get near someone they will immediately stop moving and just wait to hear you stomp your way into their vicinity so they can end your pathetic life. Have you ever complained about lag before? Do you want to? There s this reoccurring problem on Miramar where you will not have the right amount of squad members in your games. You either begin the game 1 3 people down or you leave lobby and re enter in hopes of a full squad.

You are likely to go through multiple buildings and not find even a pistol. It can result in uneven disadvantaged fights or looting for too long trying to find a decent weapon and a sight with no car around getting terrible circle RNG and having to run across the entire map for 3/4 of the game. This is very fustrating boring and happens way too often. The blue circle is mechanics are annoying. It isn't a big disdvantage for players until the very last few safe zones come into factor. So players can sit in and move around safely inside the circle for a good chunk of the game.

12/11/2017,0,0,545,TRUE,Not Recommended,The plain and simple truth of this game is that it is a legitimately fun experience but is completely ruined by the complete lack of intiative on the part of the developers. Instead of making new maps and new guns they need to get rid of the hacking problems and fix the issues regarding bullets registering on enemy players and vehicles. You could be wearing the highest tier of armor available in the game and a headshot from an enemy player can knock you down. But the minute you try the same thing on an enemy player your bullets don't perform the same as theirs. More than half the time it seems like the tick rate favors enemy players. The bullet damage is grossly inconsistent.I love this game but I cannot bring myself to recommend it to anyone until all of its early access issues are finally fixed. In spite of its popularity this game is plagued by problems that could kill it stone dead within a few months.Region lock the game or something and keep the Chinese players out of the North American servers. It's nothing against a particular region it's just that there are simply millions of hackers coming out of that region of the world. Anyone with a 51 KD ratio or higher is an obvious cheater and shouldn't be allowed to log in and f*** up everyone else's gameplay experience.

7/11/2018,0,0,673,FALSE,Not Recommended,"This game since the begininng had nothing but problems. From d sync to hacking. Bluehole had an opportunity to create a game that stood the test of time. But with the lack of community transparency and the lack of oblivious known issues that needed hotfixes this game went straight into becoming a money grab. Instead of fixing known exploits in their maps they introduce loot crates. Of course you have to pay to open. Instead of doing a normal region lock on the servers that the community begged and pleaded for the creator told its player base that they are racist people for not allowing international IPs to play in domestic servers. Taking weeks almost months for a general hotfix that could have saved it's player base. This game was enjoyable at first. Now it's all about d sync and hacking issues within its servers that Bluehole and PUBG are taking forever to fix. Let's put it this way it took PUBG almost a full year (from beta access) to implement an ""anti cheat system"" and it didn't even work for the first couple of months of implementation. There are a lot of reasons that PUBG's competitor Epic Game's Fortnite is beating them even after completely changing their platform of Fortnite. Some people don't remember Fortnite's original genre. It was a survival horde game with a linear storyline and had a horrendous multiplayer which was the same thing but just playing with friends. They implimented their battle royale multiplayer servers and it was hit. Not only because it was free to play but Epic Games listened to their community and did the hotfixes that needed to be done to help players play the game with ease and comfort without d sync and hacking. Yes there are hackers in Fortnite there are always going to be hackers in multiplayer PC game but you can for damn sure rely on Epic to solve these issues a lot faster and a lot swifter than Bluehole and PUBG could ever do.Would I recommend this game? No. Go play fortnite. It's free. It's practically the same game with a different twist. and it's developer knows a thing or two about keeping it's playerbase happy.This game had so much potential but because of the money hungry company that never listened to it's community and instead implemented cash grabs within its game this game is now trying to catch up in popularity that it once started.Good job PUBG and Bluehole.

The idea behind the game and the whole battle royal concept is the best thing I've come across in a long time. The game is fun! The THEORY of this game is just great BUT unless you have a HIGH END gaming PC you will absolutely have problems running this game. The aiming is broken the servers are so laggy and the gameplay is just.. for lack of a better word Twacked. It still has buildings/map rendering issues and the settings do VERY little to help FPS. Its been out for awhile and could've been fixed by now but its not.

When a game expects you to spend so much time each match gearing up with very few enemy interactions until late game it is completely unacceptable for each enemy encounter to be luck of the draw. I had several instances where I would get the drop on an enemy and my shots would simply not register for one reason or another. To make things worse dieing from this means starting from scratch again with a VERY SLOW start to each match. I requested a refund but did not get it due to time played.
