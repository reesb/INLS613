The latest update (04/20/2017) improved not only the game but the overall performance on lots of machines. I am running an old AMD Phenom 2 X4 with only 16 GB RAM and a GTX 750ti with 50 60 frames outside of cities and around 35 in cities.Before the patch it was like 35 40 outside and 15 25 inside. No tweaks in config nothing. This is just awesome! Thank you for this amazing progress and dedication!,Recommended
Lots of potential,Recommended
Po i is my city,Recommended
This game is very addicting but has a steep learning curve. The graphics are awesome but the game itself is full of bugs. Hope they perfectly get rid of all bugs soon.,Recommended
fun with friendsedit you will have low fps if you don't have a god tier CPU,Recommended
dont die in red zone,Recommended
PUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive) after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60 70 players alive). After the 3rd/4th blue circle You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win! But alas...you make an idiotic mistake. You end as #2.....that moment will haunt you forever...This is what will happen every game you'll feel rage anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is over....until you start the next one. Welcome to the battleground.,Recommended
best battle royale game hands down,Recommended
so good game and fun alot of bugs but i didn't take a bug but still good game and i recommend for who players like battle royale game and get chicken dinner and more tournament please,Recommended
Best game ever... if you are the best Battle Royale player ever....,Recommended
The new map is pretty good 7/10,Recommended
nice one,Recommended
Recent updates have been improving the game. Feels like the game might be back on track.,Recommended
Love it. I dont encounter hackers that much anymore so i will believe they did something with the anti cheat. Also some bugs were fixed but not all of them.Those cons things aside i think this game is awesome and capture every genre i love like open world survival and FPS. After they fix the server issues i will love to see it in the e sports scene. The perfomance on my mid range PC became better and better after tons of updates and i know can get up to 75 85 FPS in medium settings.Edit It seems they fixed the server stability making it from 24Hz to 60HzEdit 2 About the Event Pass for me at least its not a big deal. They added something so you can get skins by leveling up and doing missions which lets you have a purpose for playing the game (at least for casuals). If you dont like it dont buy it. It doesnt make you better at the game.Overall 9/10 worth the money.,Recommended
very fun game,Recommended
Product received for free. Fortnite but better.9.7/10,Recommended
Very cool games I like it very much. I'm happy because I got to the camouflage mechanical skin .The strong sense of operation makes people feel a feeling of being in the world. It's a good hit. It's very interesting to have four teams with friends because there are always interesting things to happen. When you meet another four person team it's a moment of excitement. We need to communicate and discuss tactics to eliminate the enemy on the opposite side so as to ensure that we are not eliminated. Of course sometimes the tactics are good but the game is finished because the technology is not good so it's very angry and wants to do a good shot. In a word I think the game is interesting even though I have played for five hundred hours I don't get tired of it. So people who like to play games can buy this game strongly recommend!!!!,Recommended
Awesome,Recommended
Best PvP survival game I've ever played,Recommended
Awesome game with so much potential. Still in early acces though ull find some bugs still amazing game.,Recommended
Really like it,Recommended
Ok yea devs have had its shair of bullsiht. But to say this game is bad is just wrong. Its getting a lot better and if you have a good PC it runs perfectly fine. Fortnite is just a kiddy game with gunplay that isnt even close to this. I recomend it! Devs are starting to listen and even in this state the game is so much fun and very tense at times. People really need to give it a second chance!,Recommended
Very good game for Veterns at the genre or new people wanting to try out a Battle royale. Very good support on the game and they actually update and add new guns and vehicles. 98/10 would give the last 2 points but it is still early access and has huge potential.,Recommended
I understand the game has its faults but I like it! Nothing quite gives me the same rush.,Recommended
Okey First things first obviously game craves for optimalization.But let's create a list of Pros and ConsPros+ # Game is Fun to play for me it's a game which works good around idea of battle royale *few games failed miserably so yeah that is a succes* # Feeling endangered at every bit of square meter # Shooting Other players it's naturally fun even when i die before i kill anyone but i'm getting hang of it so everythin can be learned . # Inventory UI works well and doesn't make you squint where the hell i left something so tiny plus for thatVisuals are not bad but having everything set to low gives you a lot of advantage / .Cons # Optimalization need's some work. # movement is sometimes clunky and interaction with items sometimes makes you wait for action to happen. # Loot dropped everywhere creates a weird feeling. *Cool idea for devs Weapons and other stuff like that in houses are random but in boxes which are generated on fly so basicly loot inside is rolled at first opening of the box inside house or Warehouse . # Clothes on the floor all look the same so always white shirt and always black pants it should be seen from distance what colour that item is. I hope that small detail will be patched. Not a big deal but still nice to have. # Settings in menu are done in a weird manner every thing should have it place so for Instance Anti Alias should have simple 2x 4x 6x 8x and not V Low Low Medium High Ultra and it gives us a lot of bloom with it so no separated settings would be so nice to get as much from game. But still thing to develop until that i will check ini settings # leaving a car while moving creates damage at least do animation responding to that bcuz that makes weird sittuations someone jumps the car damaged but still ready to shoot me straight away it gives some advantage as an tiny exploit . in My opinion. # Weapon Attachments should've some statistics about what they give in percentage or anything numerical and gun could've stats in Inventory too # Audio sometimes distorts on spawn area *lobby* before getting into plane # Having low setting's give advantage so playing on prettier game makes you worse in comparison with people playing on a poorer pc components # Loot boxes Fine idea but every item is thrown into one so i cannot choose what item i want to roll *box for every category of clothing would be nice *box for Tops Pants . Another For hats and masks other for boots and gloves would be nice i could like at least choose for what I'm Aiming buying a crate.And that game in current state for me is 6/10 or 7/10 it's a bit rough piece of Coal but with some work it can be better and better. Some things are trivial i know that but in summary game is Fun and i hope it will go out from early acces hell to be a normal product with updates events and stuff like that Upcoming updates are a good sign . That Was a Casual review Thanks for reading i reccommend that game for scavengers and shooters left in some Russian island,Recommended

I know people are complaining about the game being laggy and unoptimizable but after the FIX PUBG update it sure does make the game more smooth the gameplay is also better than before and i like the Battle Royale style of this game and atleast the developer care to make this game better.8/10 would recommend this game,Recommended

Well well.This game is great i love everything about it and its most importantly fun.2 beautiful maps intense gunplay and very good graphics.The only bad thing about this game is the F ing hackers holy cow. The day im writing this review i have met 4 hackers.......If this doesent get fixed or done something with i will stop playing this game. It is really fun and amazing but those damned hackers.Another thing this game needs to fix is the GOD DAMNED PARACHUTES! They are not good........Anyways if these things gets fixed this game is a 10/10,Recommended

I had loads of fun in this game. One of my definite favorites in solo duo and squad gameplay.I prefer this over Fortnite because this game just feels more competitive/realistic. (Everyone has their preferences)Want to murder every person in your path? You are encouraged to.Want to go for airdrop crates with insane weapons with the risk of dying? Its here.Want to be a retard and do backflips on a motorbike then explode? This game has it.Want to shoot a World War 2 era Soviet machine gun at your enemies? My personal favorite. Anyways this game was very much worth my $30 dollars!,Recommended

I do hope that this game will recieve some optimization in the near future the game has lots of potential but unfortunately is full of cheaters and bugs... Maybe now after they sold more than 20 Milion copies of this game they have the resources to enhance the game!,Recommended

"I simply do not know why people are bashing this so much it is not a terrible game at all for $30. I have not had any crashes at all and neither have the people that i've played with which have way more hours than I do. Only problem (which isn't really a problem just kind of annoying) I have ran across is when playing with random squads is that it is mostly full of Asian people and as I do not speak any form of any language other than Spanish and English it makes it hard to communicate where a shooter is where we wanna go if they have any items etc. As of so far I have not (to my knowledge) met any hackers that are blatantly cheating.Overall I would def. reccomend this game as it is better optimised (I do not have a OP GPU and I still run it on 50 65ish FPS) than before. If you are looking for a game that is cheaper than the $60 AAA titles to play alone or with some friends for a good amount of time than I would reccomend this just make sure your computer has the minimum requirements to the ""T"" so to speak.",Recommended
Despite what everyone else is saying I really like this game. For everyone saying the netcode is terrible and there are constant crashes I don't know what your specific problem is but I really haven't had many of these issues. For me the netcode isn't perfect but it gets the job done. People say they are always dying behind walls I haven't had this issue. People are saying that the hit detection always misses hits for them I haven't had this issue. For me I either hit them or just flat out miss my shot altogether. Maybe PUBG just really likes me and just hates everyone else but I haven't had most of these problems and the ones that I had earlier have somewhat gone away. I personally say go for it and if you'rehaving problems refund it.,Recommended

I am not sure why some people are having trouble running this game on high end pcs. I have a mid range i5 7600k gtx 1060 OC 3gb gpu with 16gb ddr4 ram. I can play on high to ultra settings and record with fps not drop below 60fps. Yes the servers can be laggy. This seems to be getting better though. What bugs me about this game is the fact that players can not be rewarded for strategy in that you can be left in a bad position just because of the random circle collapses. Also the player base in the OC server is becoming toxic. Cheats are becoming more and more common. Overall I do recommend the game as it is a lot of fun when you play against genuine players. I just hope the dev team tweaks the end game a bit and stamps out the cheaters with aggressive bans.,Recommended

Gameplay and balance is great. very tense rounds keep you on the edge of your seat. Though the time between two games is too much. On being killed you need to exit the current round go back to main menu choose a new round wait for it to match to load the plane to approach the island the parachute drop to end. Also the optimization could be way better. PLaying on high to ultra settings will burn your GPU and still have massive FPS drop while not even looking THAT great. But ignore the FPS drops and the long waits between rounds you have a very fun game and a lot of strategies to choose from.,Recommended

PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS'S or as it's mostly known as (PUBG).The game is fun and enjoyable however you will crash from time to time and it is sorta unoptimized no question.Still the game has lot's of potential and the servers work and the playerbase is semi good at best.If you want to give this game a try then go for it. (Personaly i'd wait for a sale to start to get this game)Also as a side note you may want to look up tips to play this game it's hard and does requiere a good PC to run optimized.,Recommended

This really is a wonderful game. It has some flaws but the pros compensate well for the cons. The gameplay is most of all exciting and thrilling being alone in the enormous silence of the forest and suddenly have to engage in a fire fight. I gets even more chaotic when you team up with friends in duos or squads. Then you will have a totally different experience with full scale battles. (or at least it feels like).The main downside is the optimization... you don't need good hardware to run the game. But beastly to achieve any smoothness in frames per seconds.Good gameplayGood mechanicsBad FPSMany salt8.5/10 MUGS,Recommended

123 hours in I enjoy this game a lot. It is fun both solo or with friends. The randomness keeps it exiting every time you drop out of the plane. The game had some FPS issues but since 1.0 came out the game has been running very smooth on my medium ranged PC. In my hours played I have never been killed by an obvious hacker (EU servers) but have heard many teammates call out good players as hackers. Its a bit of a witch hunt. Especialy in competative games like this sometimes its hard to admit you just got outskilled. There is some lag at the beginning of rounds though I will admit. Hopefully it wil get fixed.,Recommended

"the year is 2017. i dont know how i know but i do!i woke up on an island along with about 100 other people. they started yelling weird in different languages at each other. some of them found weapons they started firing into the crowd of the rest of us. blood fire and smoke was everywhere but it didnt seem to hurt anyone.suddenly out of nowhere everything turns black and i wake up in an airplane with the same people as before. im not sure if they all know whats going on or they have all lost their mind as im starting to since they are all still screaming like crazy.the hatch on the plane opens and people start jumping out still yelling what i assume is battlecries.the plane is about half empty when i decide to take the chance and jump out looking for cover in any building i can and hoping for some supplies and possibly some weapons to defend myself should the need arise.after a couple of minutes i see a blue wall kinda thing come rushing towards me. it scares the out of me and i run as fast as i can away from it looking for some kind of vehicle. adrenaline is pumping as i spot a jeep in the distance. i get into it and start driving at full speed over hills and fiels to get away from what i have come to call ""the blue death"".as i drive shots are being fired in the distance and hitting the jeep. i start evasive maneuvers and avoid being shot to death from whoever and whereever it was.i noticed the blue death stopping behind me and i start looking for new cover.a nice 2 story house with ammunition inside. should do just fine. when i get to the 2nd floor i see a medkit on the floor which should come in handy later. just as im about to pick it up i hear a sound behind me...F***!!.... some idiot was hiding behind the door having put the medkit there as bait. before i get to draw my weapon he shot my head off...everything got black and i wake up...back on the island... with 100 other people...wondering when this hell will stop",Recommended

Violence speed momentum Dr.DisRespect 2017Or also a game with no enemies to shoot at getting one shotted from shotguns and snipers getting killed when trying to find a gun dying to the circle etc...Needs a lot of improvements though especially client and server performance ones.I recommend to play it with friends it's a lot better then.,Recommended
Its early access but its not too bad at the moment. There is some basic stuff missing (like a way to adjust voice chat volume) the server connection can pretty janky at times and its a bit of a one trick pony with just a single mode split into 3 different team sizes.But I am happy with it and looking forward to seeing where it goes. Guns are powerful and fairly easy to find but there with the different types (pistols automatics shotguns) and helmets/armor you can still find yourself feeling vulnerable and wanting to look for more gear even after you loot a couple houses. When you can easily go 10 min without actually seeing another player Its great at building tension as you hear footsteps nearby that are not your own and you got to decide whether to hunt them down or wait for them to pass (or come to you). As far as winning is concerned you won't do it often. Like *very* rarely will you win. Hell your odds are so slim you'll probably around until there is only 50 of the 100 starting players left then you'll start paying attention. Then it will get down to 25 and you'll start feeling some pressure. 15 10 people left and the tension really racks up as the zone at this point is very small and buildings are most likely extremely limited sometimes not even having any. Less than 10 people left and you lock it down as your palms sweat and every decision carries tremendous weight. Then you get down to 7 then 4 then it is just you and one other guy. And if you pull off that final kill it is *exhilarating*. I really have never been done so much fist pumping and cheering for a win as I did when I got my first solo win. I may as well have won the world championship for how it felt.Overall its kinda bare bones but there is still a core concept that works very well and it enjoyable on its own. It should only improve as additions are made.8/8/2017 Update Basic third person mode is still good. An additional first person mode only was added. Nice addition with a slightly different playstyle but for whatever reason runs quite poorly. Where the base mode I would get only 2 3 FPS drops during a match where it would go from 60 fps to maybe 35 fps I get drops to 35 FPS every couple of minutes drops to 10 FPS or less every 6 7 minutes and at least once a match will just freeze for full couple of seconds. Its a good idea for another mode but it REALLY shows that it is early access in this mode. Overall still recommend game.,Recommended
spend money on this game? Why not? mixed reviews? Of course this game is still in early access where early access is a great platform because it gives developers the ability to get feedback from new players to get the best games at the end,Recommended

gud gayme,Recommended
Listen I understand the fact that customization items for your character came in and it was all nice because it was community ran when it came to purchasing these cosmetics. But the thing that made me stray off from the path of loving pubg is the fact that you added keys. Yes no longer just crates and cosmetics but KEYS. Why do you want to ruin your fanbase so badly? Im not sure myself but I can say onething for certain. If you don't fix your anti cheat system the chinese people raid and the keys system youre going to be done for. Either way its a really fun game to play with friends ),Recommended
PUBG is a flawed masterpiece. Sure it has its downfalls with the slowness and the server problems and the hackers but the game itself at its core is a great concept executed rather well. As opposed to Fortnite which focuses on fast paced heavily cartoony gameplay PUBG has a more slow paced realistic feel. Both games definitely have their draws but I feel PUBG is worth the money over the free Fortnite for a few reasons.1. The gameplay As I said the PUBG gameplay tends to be slower and a little lessaction packed than Fortnite which I believe works in its favour. Without the ability to build and alter the world with an overpowered god tool like the pickaxe PUBG makes players rely more heavily on their quick thinking and knowledge in regards to the existing world. This makes gameplay more challenging and more exhilerhating and far more fulfilling when you overcome any disadvantage you may have with nothing but your pure skill as a player (okay maybe there is some luck involved too). Also the inclusion of a first person perspective mode is seriously a huge merit to PUBG.2. The Playerbase Being a free and easy to run game Fortnite attracts a lot of people who could otherwise not afford a game or a better computer this demographic includes a healthy serving of children. The stereotypical Fortnite player is an early teenage boy with a bad mouth and a tendency to sleep with the mothers of his opponent. This is NOT the only type of people that play the game though there are still people that play it because they prefer it or for other maybe monetary reasons. I'm just saying that this is the core demographic. If you have a group of friends to play with and keep in game chat off it can be no different that PUBG.3. The Weapons Having the ability to modify weapons with attachments really does add to the game immensely. Not only this but also the vast variety of weapons helps make the game more varied and give the player more choice in regards to their style of play.Now it may seem like I'm blindly in love with PUBG and just a Fortnite hater or something I can assure you this isn't the case. Fortnite 100% has its merits it runs better it has better and more consistent servers and the devs aren't as dumb (seriously don't sue the company which develops the engine your game runs on) and depending on your preference it has better gameplay (if you'r eimpatient or just like to shoot a lot of things very quickly Fortnite is definitely a better suit for you). Fortnite also has much less of a problem with hackers. Now that we're done with the comparison let's get in to pros and cons.Pros Weapons high variety and customizability makes for better gameplay. FPP first person perspective is a much more intense and fun experience. Realism while maybe not the most realistic the grittiness and somewhat realistic gunplay definitely adds to the experience. Updates as a game with active developers PUBG is constantly getting new content and bugfixes and whatnot completely free. General Gameplay you are lying if you've played PUBG and say you have not felt at some point tense with adrenaline pumping through you as you lie in the grass with 3 players left. This intensity of play that is delivered by the game's core mechanics is unrivaled by any other game I've played.Cons Hackers hackers ruin the experience of this game when you encounter them. It is awful to play a half hour round only to be headshot by a guy facing the other direction on the other side of a building clipping underground running at the speed of sound. PUBG Corp has done very little to combat these issues (the 20MB patches aren't helping a whole lot). Crates If I'm paying $30 for a game I expect to not have to pay anything else. I should be entitled to my in game cosmetics without having to pay 3 dollars for a key to unlock a crate. It's stupid. To add insult to injury PUBG Corp is adding more and more exclusive cosmetic items in more and more paid for crates. Please stop this. Servers The PUBG servers are notoriously bad. They go down more than a cheap hooker on a friday and even when they are up they run worse than a one legged race horse. Optimization The performance has definitely gotten better but on my mid high end PC I still have to run the game at very low (except for textures and AA) to have an acceptable experiece. (constant 60+. Anything higher I get 60+ most of the time with major drops when it matters in a gunfight or while driving)If the devs fix these problems this game will go down in history as one of the best ever. But even now the game is definitely worth playing. Some of the problems such as cosmetics are easy to ignore and the others don't pop up often enough to completely destroy the experience. If you're looking for a fun multiplayer experience that at the moment is unrivaled then PUBG is for you. It is especially fun when enjoyed with friends or so I've heard.,Recommended
This is the best game I've bought. The gameplay is immersive and realistic from the environment to the effects all the way to combat Dynamics. It's the best battle Royale I've ever come across putting fortnite to shame as a cartoon sci fi childs game with all that immediate building and kiddish graphics. PubG will lend you many hours of enjoyment with Friends as you try to survive till the end. Don't get caught by the blue wall of death when the zone shrinks though! Yes there are a few hackers but the developers have been very good at minimizing and banning the ones that have been identified. I rarely come across one now. And yes the game still needs a region lock implemented so that we don't have to deal with Chinese in the North American servers.... Otherwise this is the best game for your money right now and will definitely not disappoint!,Recommended

good game but bad servers killing this game,Recommended
Love this game and its highly addictive but being early access it has its flaws in the combat system and a few other minor things. The only thing I really dislike about it is that their is no bullet penetration what so ever it seems like. I was shooting a guy coming up my staircase and my bullets just seemed to hit every little wooden pillar and I didnt get a single hit on him. Kind of upset but im sure they will fix it once the full game is released. For 30 dollars its not too shabby at all. Just be prepared to experiance some revolving combat issues.,Recommended
awesome game lags are fixed but hard to master worth every penny,Recommended
Pretty entertaining game. Does not take too long for a one match to finish a lot of action satisfaction on getting a kill and if you get your friends involved into this massacre it evolves into a game full of cooperation and coordination which is fun. I'll give it a solid 9 out of 10 because they need to fix stuff like bandwidth and optimize a little bit more out of this game otherwise its pretty good.,Recommended

I understand ther are some complaints about this game. Truth be told I have had several moments where I was at the game and the devs. However I feel it is important for us to understand there is no such thing as a perfect system. While I am not too happy about the news of paid crates I cannot help but still be in love with this game. I support the devs and support the title. Being a grateful member of this community I have accepted to see this one through all the ups and downs. I am sure it will have quite a few downs in the future but I believe in the devs and I belive in this game. No game has offered me this much fun in years. I just got my frist chicken dinner 4 hours ago and am still excited. I think you guys should remember if you have nothing to do but to complain maybe this one isn't for you like you originally thought however if you are like me you will see this one through no matter what and never stop playing. Let's support our dev team more and believe in them in the end I think they will get this one down. Please stop the hate comments they understand the problems and are well aware of the public oppinion. They work hard as hell to ensure everyone is on a level playing field and can have an enjoyable and immersive experience. Thank you to the devs thank you to my community that I cheerish so highly. I love all of you guys we are family lets stick this one out and keep playing it will get the way it needs to be in some time. &lt 3,Recommended

How can an early access game be this good you ask?By taking the best out of the already existing battle royal games and putting it into one we get Frankenstein's Asa Akira that we all hate that we love and that we keep going back to even after throwing the keyboard at the monitor.Nothing is as sweet as getting that chicken dinner that you've worked so hard for.Trying to be serious now it's a great game that comes with frequent updates because of its early stage and developers that listen to the fans to actually make the game better. I foresee a bright future for PUBG LessThanThree,Recommended

Got bored,Recommended
Cons Slow paced games. The average amount of toxicity. So goddamn frustrating. A decent amount of bugs and bad textures.Pros Awesome realistic artstyle map layouts and graphics. Awesome guns. Awesome sights and other attachments. Killing and looting other players for items you don t already have is awesome. A decent amount of lads The driving is pretty good I guess.There are few games I actually can play hundreds of hours but this is one of them.Although I haven t won many times and I only have a decent amount of kills I love this game.Looting sounds a lot more boring than it is I enjoy it because you have to think about what you have what you are going to need what you could keep just in case and all that stuff. I think it s sad that it has so bad ratings and I honestly don t see why it does.I mean you have to look at the game as a whole not give it a bad rating after trying to challenge an M249 with your tommy gun. And stop ripping on the Chinese they can be pretty annoying but that doesn t make the game bad in say.,Recommended
I love the game very much even thow I have not play a lot only about 94 hours. I would rcommend it to other prople that like gun games it has many ways of playing the game like custom matches and fpp. I like how you can play in duos and squads and solo to. The game has very good graphics and it looks and feels very real. Hope you have the game and like or get it.,Recommended

"I definitely feel as if this game is a little bit overpriced for what you are getting especially since it is an early access game. However if you shift your perspective a little bit you can definitely see why the price is what it is. You start playing solo and you immediately get pulled into this battle royale experience one in which you are eager to reign supreme. So you play this game for hours and hours and hours until you gain experience and improve as a player. Eventually you get your first ""chicken dinner"" as we all call it and that moment feels so accomplishing and relieving. You feel as if you are supposed to stop playing the game because of this satisfaction but no. Instead you feel like going for ANOTHER win and you keep going and going. There is no stop. And then you bring in friends with you which opens the door to so many more opportunities in this game. You also meet new people and get to know them better in a sense as to how they think and operate inside their brain. Countless memories are created with these friends as there is so much you can do with them. For example you can do different challenges or you could go even crazier and do bike stunts in game only to find that you crash and die in the most hilarious way possible! This game not only brings you in but brings others in with you and helps create a unique bonding experience you will not find elsewhere.",Recommended

I have a i5 6600k and a GTX 970 I had to do some tweaks but I get about 60 fps + some drops to 40 in cities but it's fine. Overall I like the feel of the game and it has a lot of potential and it's also x1000 better than h1z1 and it's just released.,Recommended
Love it but still needs more work. Dev's really care about the game though and all problems are ironed out fairly fast.,Recommended
Great game. really wish there were a map preference option though. Not a fan of the new ma p at all and would love an option to opt out of playing it,Recommended
Personally I enjoy the game. I don't care about the whole idea to region lock china since I just play the game for 2 hours at most. I think it is better than fortnite when it comes to the gun play for me.,Recommended
Dev's still have some tweaking to do but I have gotten at least $30 of enjoyment so I can recommend. Fixes needed Technical Player Collisions causing Lag Driving over fences *sometimes works* Lag makes firefights hit and miss (literally)Gameplay Final 4 circles close too fast to be tacticle.

My best friend convinced me to get into this game. I had heard about the BR craze that had been going on for a few months before I got in on it. (Let me butt this statement in here FORTNITE IS CANCER) I love this game! Orginally the game if I remember correctly was a mod for Arma 2 which means it has many of the same controls and functions used in Arma which is very good. Unfortunetely well actually fortunetely they realease updates frequently. It's unfortunate for me because I have capped internet. Me and my said friend have gotten a dinner once. My heart rate was at an unhealthy level at that time. Get it it's better than Fortnite.,Recommended

Great game that is unlike any other and very few can hold a candle to. The people that dislike this game are the ones that dont have 29.99 to spend on the game or are people that do not understand that a game of this magnitude takes time to develop. At this point in time i have just under 1700 hours played there are not many games that i have played that can hold my attention such as this game day in day out.,Recommended

This is my favorite Battle Royale Style game. I started on H1Z1 with everyone else and when this was released I never looked back. I'm not a big fan of Fortnite because I stink at building and the availability of options with guns on this game is my favorite aspect of the game. I like being able to customize the guns and loadouts due to suit your playstyle. Player Unknown has done a great job of releasing new content to keep the game fresh.,Recommended

PUBG may have some flaws but the good stuff about it makes them insvisible. It's an amazing game and have tons of future potentiality they can make it even bigger and better. It's amazing to play alone and with friends but i do recommend playing with a friend or a few friends for the best experience. I used to play on a really bad computer with 30 40 fps on very low and 1680x1200 (Normal res is 1920x1080 on my screen) and i still had an amazing time. Now i bought a new computer and play on pretty much max settings or atleast i can but i dont really do that cause it has pretty much 0 visable difference between some settings. But before full game realese PUBG 1.0 i had max 90 100 fps mostly 60 80 sometimes even 40 and this is with a 1070 and I5 7600K and now after realese i have above 100 fps on better settings then i had before so its alot better now a days and is constantly updated so i recommend PUBG. 10/10 Most Fun Game of the year nerv racking and intense the way i like it ),Recommended

"I'm very torn when it comes to PUBG on one hand it is a super fun if poorly optimized game. On the other hand I have some big problems regarding recent changes. It feels like with the rise of Fortnite the developers tried to turn the game into a version of Fortnite PUBG is not Fortnite and it should not try to be. Emotes? No thanks. Event Pass? No. AND if they insist on doing event passes they SHOULD NOT make the free leveling rewards leave players inventory's after 30 days people have put time into getting these they should keep them. I really wish Steam had a middle ground rating because that's what I want to give it.Gameplay Fun enough more realistic than other BR games.Performance Servers are... Meh at best not the worst I've ever played on but for having only official servers I would expect more.quite possibly my biggest issue with the game is the fact that I have everything on low and can't even hit my monitor's native refresh rate and before you ask yes I do meet in fact exceed the recommended spec. Would I recommend? Again I wish I could give an ""ok"" but since I can't I'll have to recommend it. I have had a lot of fun with friends.Overall 8.5/10",Recommended
A great game combat feels good seems the devs have traded out having hitmarks for blood spraying. It's not a bad change it's just kind of confusing sometimes to know if you sniped someone or not. I don't over estimate bullet drop and after you learn the map it doesn't seem that big. All around great game there are only 2 things I dont like. The game always has lag when in the plane and randomly has lag spikes. It still runs good on a 1050 ti just the rendering is a little slow. The last problem is the iron sights on guns. If you don't have a scope or red dot might as well shoot in 3rd person.,Recommended

I would recommend this game but I don't want my friends to want to kill themselves after playing like I do. It's definitely fun however as I said I want to kill myself after playing it. This game is like having a beautiful child born to you only for it to be killed on it's 4th birthday. You're not mad that it happened but you still feel like shooting yourself in the head when you realize how much the developers are on this game. The premise is great but the absolute garbage servers and amount of purely that happens is ridiculous. I've started to not even get triggered when some laying down in a random field kills me because it saves me the trouble of killing myself because the game makes me feel so dead inside. There is a special kind of sadness that this game can bring you spending 20 minutes looting an entire village to not only get the worlds worst loot (some gas cans and a pan) only to run into aforementioned sitting down in a field and kill you. Boom 20 minutes wasted. But worry not because the ingenius developers realize that to make this game bearable the user must sit through 2 3 minutes of lobby time just to get into a new game and playing again. During this time I recommend that you think of the most efficient ways to kill yourself after your disappointing loss. I spend hours on this game the one thing I can look forward to is maybe just maybe getting some fun item in a loot crate. I use my HARD EARNED resources on a loot crate only to find out to open this god damn loot crate I need to pay for a mother ing key. I can only assume this process is to provide the player with a sense of pride and accomplishment. I truly do not understand 2 things about microtransactions in this game. Who the wants to buy for this AIDS game? AND why the hell do the developers think they need to put in microtransactions before fixing things like severe lag (it has gotten better I suppose) terrible hit registration and plenty of other glitches and problems. Instead they add ing microtransactions. Also I don't understand their developer decision from a financial standpoint why you would want to spend money on having some cool coat when you can just find a lot of them on the ground in the map anyways? Why are they even on the ground?? Probably makes the game run even more like dog with having all these random cosmetics EVERYWHERE.It's unfortunate this developer was the lucky one that popularized the genre. Overall it's still fun the game just makes you want to die. I wouldn't recommend this game if you're depressed because you may just end it all after playing it.,Recommended

I like this game it's gameplay is like a simpler Arma (my opinion) but it is great. It is fun to have this anxiety over you as you never know if you get shot in the back by someone you did not know was there aswell as the adrenaline building up as you reach the final 10 last players. If you got friends this game gets even better as you got the possibility too 1. Use them as cannon fodder as the idiots they are WHY DO YOU RUN INTO THE OPEN !!!!. 2. Make them pick up the stuff you want because YOU ARE 10 x BETTER THAN YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU KNOW IT!!!. 3. Pick up their supplies because they died as 4. I heard that they sometimes do see other players and can give information have yet to test this outIt is an Early Access game and you can feel it will it be released? Devs say so it is yet too see as most of us have experienced the bad parts of Steam Early Access. But for slightly less than 30 euroes (Atleast in my currency) i think it is worth it based on the fun i have. I use a gtx 970 but as far as i have learned the game is a lot more CPU heavy in this stage due to it not being optimized as far as i know (might be wrong) games tend to lean heavily on the CPU until they optimize it too render more on the GPU do check out guides on improving your framerate and similar as i have experienced that can be quite gamechanging. I do though think that this game can prove too be a lot of fun once it is fully optimized and lead too some fun ways too improve your teamplay or prepare you for Arma if you want too try something with similar yet more casual gameplay. Will update once it is released fully.,Recommended
Summed upPros Good gunplay. Frequent patches in early access. Cool map. Very exciting and thrilling. Matches start very fast. Many scopes and attachments (though attachments are kind of meaningless because you are gonna use them like every time).Cons Desync. Bugs (early access still though so). RNG not that strategic zone moves quickly and forces you to take bad routes with no cover. I wish the matches would be a little longer so I had time to play in cover and choose tactically. It's really the battle royale genre though.Conclusion Fun game best with friends in squad mode. Has problems and it also has the RNG factor.,Recommended

This game provides a myriad of emotions from me. Elation happiness giddiness as well as anger hurt resentment and hatred. This is by far one of the best last man to survive/team games ever made. The atmosphere is incredible. Decent graphics coupled with hilarious glitches at times makes it a fun time for days. If you can stand the still in development combat/animations/textures etc then this game is definitely something you should pick up. Especially for the CO OP aspect and SQUAD aspect. Without a doubt the loot will frustrate you the players will frustrate you the circle will frustrate you but at the end of the day you will have a ton of fun just ploughing away at people less fortunate then you in regards to the above mentionables. What this game truly suffers from is bad servers bad hit registration at times terrible loot chance and some underhanded tactics with graphics. They supposebly patched the ability to edit out foilage from the ini.file. However there is a noticeable effect when putting your graphcis settings on low that foilage DOES NOT LOAD after a certain amount of meters distance. What does that mean for you? THAT MEANS if you are in tall grass or wheat fields etc etc the foilage will not load for the person shooting you X amount of meters away. So you are COMPLETELY visible. Fundamentally this changes the entire early mid game because people are far away when you see them usually and if you are trying to hide in grass to escape or just survive you will die simply because they see you but you don't see them. This does not take affect late game because at that point everyone is within the X amount of meters and all the grass and such loads for everyone. UNLESS they are hacking of course which of course there are hackers out there rare though they are. My second complaint/suggestion would be ENFORCED first person when inside a building. There's some truly horrible peaking around the corner action going on when in third person and it completely screws the individual who has superior position. One of the problems with third person is you are able to line up your gun on a target from behind a corner and come out shooting before you even round the corner. Thereby already hitting your target the split second you can and HE/SHE can't even react because they are already dead. Granted there is the off chance they anticipate you coming and just start shooting but more often than not that is not the case.I doubt this will ever be implemented of course and our only hope is FPS enforced custom servers at some point after full release. If they ever fix some of these issues this game will be a 10/10 from me. It truly is one of the best already from this niche of a genre and should they fix it it will be perfect. As of right now 6/10. Truly fun to play but without a doubt frustrating beyond all means in certain circumstances.,Recommended

"""Best Game Ever.... Of All Time"" Washington",Recommended
great game just a few lobby bugs and servers can be dodgy,Recommended
Still a very broken game you die by a UMP 9 from 300m just like when the game first came out. it takes 10 years to get into a start lobby and when youre lobby is full you have to wait another minute for some reason. The plane also takes ten years to fly across the map which really sucks because by the time you get to where you want to land some one is already on the ground fully geared and all you can find is a pistol or a crowbar. The RNG in this game is complete garbage. Oh and you need two 1080TI's to run this game on high and to get 60+ FPS. The servers this game runs on are also garbage on your screen you shoot a guy 30 times on the his? you shot him once or twice. I hate this game I'm pretty sure this game will be dead by the time BF5 comes out so.... Oh and dont forget this game will crash on you for no reason so be prepared for that. Buy it,Recommended

OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAHHHHWelcome to 1.0This game is amazing! Unreal engine 4 is a great choice for the devs thanks for all the fun PlayerUnknown!,Recommended
So after 431 hours of gameplay I can still say that I recommend this game ... I wont dive into the money grab situation that so many others are complaining about ... instead I'll tell you why I recommend the game.Why you should play The guns ... its what keeps me from going to fortnite. I love the realism that this game can provide and nothing feels as good as bursting down some noob with an AK or shoving a shotgun into their chest! BOOM!The duo mode/squad mode if you have some friends to play with this game can be hilarious. Go James Bond and grab a suppressed pistol you probably wont win but hilarious. Grab a few cars and go mad max run some nerds over and have a ball. Shoot actually play the game and use comms to destroy the other players. Its all fun!Are their bugs? Sure. Do they make this game unplayable trash? Absolutely not. Do I have fun? Hell yes!Games are meant to be fun find a way to enjoy yourself. For me PUBG is fun I hope to see you in the game!,Recommended
In my opinion this game is great. It has its flaws like all other games but it provides entertainment the pretty much sole purpose of games. Yes there are bugs but they make the game so much funnier and personally i've run into maybe 1 or 2 bugs that weren't even major. The benefits outway the negatives and i'm sure you will atleast slightly agree if you decide to purchase the game.I fully recommend that you buy this game but perhaps seek a cheaper sale of it.

I'm not a man of excellent graphics so I was okay with playing at my lowest resolution and lowest graphic setting with a steady 40 50 fps. But after they randomly dropped an update of 5gb the game has now dropped to 20fps (still the lowest settings possible) with lag spikes and very slow terrain rendering time and is now unplayable for any system that isn't made for controlling rockets in russia. If you don't have the newest PC hardware I really do not recommend this at all you are paying $40 for a game that you can't even play. If you do have a rig that is powerful enough to run this then by all means it's a ing awesome game with great yet simple task find gear hunt players and be the last person standing.EDIT had to turn it to a positive review its alrightEDIT this game is ing t still recommend it though.,Recommended

"During early access the performance was still acceptable but a year later we're on version 1.14 you'd think that the performace would only get better but as they add more and more features simply ""server patch"" or ""performance patch"" the game got worse. It's still fun to play and I'd recommend it. But BEWARE of performance issues and cheaters on the live server. You might be better playing on the Test Servers since that at least has a good performance compared to the Live Servers.",Recommended

"First off this game is good.

It's a game that many people like and love like I do. There are many that dislike/hate this game. I am not one of those people. Just know that you can say what you want about this game. So why am I saying all this? To let you know that the opinion/controversy surrounding this game is immense but once you get past all that it's home free baby!In conclusion you decide how you like this game. I'll let you decide whether you're willing to deal with all of this game's imperfections to get to the core of it A game with a good concept and with somewhat good developers behind it. Have fun everyone!",Recommended

"Having an absolute blast with this game almost 100 hours in with no plans of stopping why not write a review on why I love it?What is it? This is a Battle Royale game it's set up as a massive free for all and the last man standing wins. You're grouped up into a plane with around 100 other people and you choose where to parachute out and where to land proceeding to loot for weapons armour health and other items and then proceeding to hunt each other down. While this is going on throughout the game a circle will be making its way inwards which continues to get smaller being outside of this will cause you to take damage and eventually die the smaller it gets the more damage you take which is a great way of forcing confrontations preventing camping and generally bringing good balance to the game.The Positives Gameplay wise the movement and general controls are great and sensical with fully customizable keyboard and mouse bindings the gunplay is solid and you're able to switch at will between first and third person which is a much appreciated element. Guns sound as they should and the sound effects themselves are on par with a Battlefield game which is to say fantastic.The developers have done a great job at building upon elements of the game and taking feedback on board from what I've seen they're also due to incorporate vaulting over obstacles and climbing which I'm pretty excited about as this is definitely an area I feel would serve the game better.Weapon selection is nice and varied with new ones like the VSS which was added very recently and a new Assault Rifle that was just announced at E3 also joining the pack soon.The game offers a great layer of customisation in terms of appearance and while that doesn't matter to some people it always matters to me as I like to look to look a certain way. I'm definietly not indifferent towards this and it always helps to add replay value and provide incentives.The map is also massive and has a lot of variety in the buildings towns and locations we also have two more maps confirmed and coming which pleases me greatly!In terms of replay value and the progression system you earn points from games no matter what how many you earn depends on how well you do in a game generally and these can be spent on Supply Crates which offer a random customisation item for your character. They get more expensive as you buy more but the price resets to the basic price each Monday. It's a good system but the primary replayability comes from the game itself of course and the concept.I've had many hilarious and exciting heart pumping moments in this game and continue to have them there's such a variety of things that can happen in the game and it makes it all super addictive and super enjoyable.The Negatives The main problem for me at the moment is in terms of server lag and general lag at the start of matches which seems to be somewhat consistent. You will land on the ground and try to get into a house only to find you have to press ""F"" to open the door multiple times because your input won't register this happens consistently for me at the very start of matches and it can lead to frustration at times. (Their upcoming update is focused on server performance however which is awesome and will hopefully resolve this.)There's a few other bugs that can occur with physics and small miscallaneous things usually but generally speaking the devs have been doing a great job working on optimisation and sorting out these bugs. The last big patch was focused on optimisation and myself and friends have definitely seen improvements particularly a friend with an older GTX 770 the patch supposedly helped him a great deal.Enclosing Overall I'm having a fantastic time with this game it's made the most out of a fantastic concept and the formula is just on point. The developers are doing a solid job patching stuff up consistently and listening to player feedback sure you can have some potentially boring games where nothing eventful happens and you just get killed from someone you might not see but this unpredictability factor is one of the main draws to this game for me and it's something you don't see too much in many games nowadays I feel. The feeling you get when it's just you and one other person left alive in a tiny zone is a heart pounding feeling that I do not feel in many other games at all.Play it!",Recommended

How do I even begin to review this game? I hate it.Seriously. ing full on Anakin in a room full of Tuskan Raiders type hate. Now does that tell you about the game? No. Thats just my opinion on this magnificant shitbox for a game.Sometimes people spend a lifetime of blood sweat and tears on some labor of love only to have it ignored misunderstood or worse misused. And then sometimes someone comes along and throws some at a fan and the masses swoon and suddenly get misty. This is well this is the second variety.Thats not to say its a bad game really. I mean look at all the players. But it is a bit of a broken mess. Should you buy it? Yes. If you are on the fence just do it.There is something enraging about this game but there is also something that keeps me coming back for more. I really don't know how to describe it. Battle Royale. Short and to the point. Hide in a bush hide in a closet or run around jumping up and down looking for a fight. Pick up a gun add an attachment. Drink some Red Bull and eat some painkillers. What more do you need in a ing shooter. It also has some sort of next generation esports potential (disclaimer /s).So stop wasting your time and buy it or move along. Move along.,Recommended
The best battle Royale Game of all time.Playerunknown s Battlegrounds colloquially known as PUBG is if nothing else conceptually efficient. 100 players parachute onto an island. The last one alive wins. An unoriginal idea executed in an original fashion That s the merit of Battlegrounds.,Recommended
This game is fantastic it feels like I'm playing arma and h1z1 combined the great thing is the graphics are fantastic and you don't die when you fall a foot *cough* arma *cough* the anti cheat is doing it's job very well I have not ran into one hacker yet and I hope to not in the future. Yes I have to admit there are flaws but I'm sure they will be fixed in the future and upcoming releases. Good job and keep up the great work!,Recommended

This is a interesting game al tought the servers are colapse some times and causes have to play on far away severs. Also can be good new maps weaponsm and vehicules to upgrade the experience of the game.,Recommended
When this game isn't glitching or full of the Chinese. It's amazing! adn rage inducing with it unreliability.,Recommended
I may have not put a lot of hours into this game but I think it's over all a pretty fun game. It get's more nerve wracking (in the good way) as the ring get's smaller and smaller and you feel a sense of completion as you get better at taking more and more people out. it also feels very good to kill a person when you're in the moment. I haven't really stumbled upon a lot of bugs to be honest it really could need some better servers and it is in a desperate need of optimizing because it is not the best optimized game out there. it also needs some more maps not just that one map that goes on and on in the background because it can feel a little repetive with having the same maps at the same time.I haven't met on any hackers either I do not understand all the fuzz is about when they scream hackers might just be that they're bad at the game.I haven't seen a lot of aim bots but it just might be me that doesn't know what I should be looking for when it comes to aim bots.,Recommended

i like it,Recommended
With every update the game the gameplay gets more solid. It can be extremelly brutal and yet so satisfying at the same time. When playing solo I tend to not go in guns blazing until I know I'm going to get a sure kill but also not be picked off by someone else. Have not managed a win here yet but plenty of 2nd and 3rds. Still very satisfying and very intense.Duo or Squads it really is all about communication and synchronised attacking and defending to survive. With the guys I play with it took us awhile but have finally successfully got a win. I expect more will come.With every game there are moments that you want to forget and others you like to brag about.Just the other day In a game of Duo's three times we stole another duo's vehicle which I am sure them off greatly. Especially based on the amount of lead that flew in our direction as we boosted away. We couldn't stop laughing.Being early access there is definatly improvements to be made and we expect issues. Although the big lag issues that occured the other day was pretty annoying. On the plus side the gun gameplay seemed better and the game got smoother once player base got below 50.I cant recomend it enough. Looking forward to new weapons and maps in the future.,Recommended

By far the best Battle Royal Game on the market. I've been playing ever since it's been available on steam and also bought a 2nd copy for my brother convinced it was worth it. Now we all have seen the fix PuBG campaign and the list of performance and optimization issues Definately a con and I understand peoples concern however it's 100% worth purchasing I've spent hundreds of hours in pubg between all my accounts probably around 500 hours or soand I've also tried realm royal &amp the new BR game Fortnite. While I think fortnite definately has it's niche...In my opinion PUBG is better and hands down a ton of fun to play whether your playing duos with a pal or squad with friends this game has given me a lot of enjoyment and out of a scale of 1 to 10 to if it's worth buying? Easily give it a 10. Pubg is a wonderful game and with it's great community and a great development team we will see a lot of fixes and optimizations down the road.,Recommended

Loot crate system is the same as CS GO a.k.a. garbage.,Recommended
I had high expectations and this game still exceeded them. PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is a fun and exhilerating experience that I would strongly reccomend. The only flaw witht he game in its current state is performance it certainly runs much smoother than its competetors but framerate dips still occur.,Recommended
A quite expensive game for Early Access however it's worth it in my opinion.,Recommended
"This game truely surprised me with how much it can expand a simple core gameplay style no matter what issues I have had I do simply not care (e.g Crashes Freezes Memory Failure). It has been thoroughly enjoyable to play no matter if it be Solo Duo or Squads it does a fantastic job at what it is. As a ""Battle Royale"" style game it's gameplay was simple and easy to learn overtime as a first timer playing I was cautious but now I just go full on in a battle it's just fun! I understand why people are frustrated with this game and many moments you just feel like smashing your keyboard but that what its meant to do provide a challange. Early Access Games have and will always be buggy a bit broken or just downright unplayable. You make the choice to choose a far away location and run your way cause you can't find a vehicle the match you play is how you make it. H1Z1 had similar issues with the developers but seeming as Bluehole is expanding I can't help but feel a bit sorry no one can make something perfect and I give huge props to the team behind this fantastic game. They try to make this better but eveyone just begins to be negative cause they wont play again after the die (once). I hope the best for the devs in the future.",Recommended

This game is a fun challange at the best of times. But I wouldn't say to get it right now there are to many issues that aren't being addressed at the moument to recommend this to a new player.

"Honestly for all the crap this game gets the devs do a good job of communicating with the community and the overall game experience is solid. Of course there are things that should be better but for $30 I've gotten over 1200 hours and counting in this game and even after over 200 chicken dinners the intensity in the final 5 feels like no other game. Please add some type of progression system where players can ""level up"" and receive some type of untradeable unmarketable ""award"" for winning or leveling up. Other than that 10/10 recommend to buy.",Recommended
Just realised I hadn't updated my review since early access.PUBG has had quite a few issues over the last few months but has been improving and today it felt great and the OCE servers are finally alive again )I don't think it'll ever be as fun as it was to me last year when I was first playing and got my first few wins but its now running better then ever.,Recommended
Ok please read this carefully as I usually dont have time for reviews. I have been playing this game since beta and there were bad and good times depends on recent update what they change. Game is promissing and interesting kinda hook you up but then reality hits you when some 3rd world player with HIGH PING takes advantage of you he plays agressivelly and shoot you before you even notice he is comming and that ruins your game experience when you lose almost all close quater fights.PUBG is only game I know so far when technological advantage (LOW PING) is actually disadvantage.New matching (matching pool of people with low ping) was promissing but I actually still have same close quater fight experience could be ping variance or some people missusing it (change ping to high after matchmaking). So PUBG is exciting game mixed in with miserable experience.,Recommended
Most poorly optimized I've ever seen game runns like a ING POWERPOINT every round I loot for what feels like forever and then I sit down for ONE SECOND to drink an energy drink and i ALWAYS GET HEADSHOTTED . Also lobby chat is the definition of weaponized autism everybody in the game is chinese and the red zone is guaranteed to blow out your eardrums every time it lands.This game is literally worse than cancer.10/10 would recommend I play it like four times a day.,Recommended
Pubg is an amazing and fun fpp and tpp game. Prehaps one off the best I have expirenced. I highly recommend this game to others to buy since it can be a competive game and then a game for fun also. I have over 100 hours of gameplay and still is growing. Pubg can also be played in many differnt ways and tatics which makes the game more fun.,Recommended

So how about a story...... So a friend and I were playing a duo match recently and we kill another duo at one point. We were shocked to find that on these two players we killed was a fully equipped AUG which we had ammo for and on the other guy was a AWM sniper rifle with a 15X scope on it with full ammo. So we had two of the best guns in the game fully equipped and only 16 people left. We needed to move closer to the next circle so right after getting these weapons we hop on the motorcycle to move. My friend looks at me and says you drive I said no i don't trust myself you drive. About 10 seconds after leaving on the bike in a completely open field we hit some bump we did not see and flip over and die. I peed myself for about 5 straight minutes laughing so hard because of it. Basically whether its a good situation gone bad like in this case or whatever the situation its a great game to play with friends. Assuming your friends know how to laugh that is....................Good game solo.........Great game with friends. It has its issues but nothing worth ing about pretty sure you can refund any game within 2 hours of playtime in it so if your thinking about getting it go for it.,Recommended

PUBG is the best game I've ever played. Sure it has bugs sure it's voice chat is hilariously bad and the $30 price tag which has drawn many of my friends away from the game. The graphics are pretty good the game's optimization is not the greatest so i5 with GTX 1050ti or higher will be your best bet for no lag on medium+. I have poured 150 hours into this dear game and it was some of the most intense stupid goofy funny and tasty (as in the chicken dinner) I have had in a video game. The day that they ruined this game was the day they brought it out of early access. It killed the reviews it brought in more hackers to try and challenge the Battleye crap. They pushed Miramar too hard. It was supposed to be the best map ever and now I get into a match in it and it has 70 80 people. Sanhok has officially been the best map and the nail in PUBG's coffin. PUBG has established itself as the E Sports competitive game. Now if you actually want to have fun and goof off with your friends a person is gonna jump you from behind a rock or tree because they detected your engine from across the map. Like seriously this game has turned into a game solely consisting of tryhards and noobs pulled in from the sale. I can't bear the fact that this game that once was amazing and fun for anyone even complete noobs has turned into this Drop land accumulate decent to good loot get jumped by guys with worse guns but good aim three stay and fight one runs away or doesn't even fight in the face of fear we all get knocked while screaming at the runner to help the circle comes in and he is forced in. The noob runs in like a chicken with their head cut off and gets one tapped to be fed to the victor of PlayerUnknown's TryhardRoyale. The moral of the story If you want to have intense fighting with good gunplay buy PUBG. If you want to goof off with your friends like it's a physics sandbox go pick up GMOD. Do I Recommend Yes to some No To Others,Recommended
I see everyone is hating on this amazing game. To bad its a fun game to watch and play.,Recommended

Great game at core with indulging gameplay but BUGS the god damn bugs. You can't go a day without asking yourself why do I play this game it gets really annoying. Yet you still come back for the fun gameplay. Very much recomended if Bluehole fixes the bugs and it seems they are already working on the other major problem i.e Hackers. Should play if you can withstand game crashes here and there with ed up vehicle physics which although annoying make for some hilarious scenarios.,Recommended

Good but It could use some work.I like this game alot it just needs some work. Currently the game has had performance issues because of it not being optimized to steam Minor setback and they will hopefully fix it in the future. Asides from that and a few other small bugs the game is amazing.,Recommended

After buying this game about a week ago and racking up a respectable 34 hours I can say that this game is truly special. I've have sleepless night ever since my purchase my sleep has decreased and work is now 10x harder but nothing is more satisfying to than winning a game after running around searching every building greeting campers with shotguns in small rooms just waiting for you. The thrill of getting killed or running into a larger group of enemies before being ran over or team killed can't be matched. Despite endless deaths you can't help but go back for more. 10/10 would recommend.,Recommended
Very nice game and will no doudt just be made better. Although South African servers would be nice.,Recommended

amazing game,Recommended
Very good idea alot woork still to be done on rating and punishing players who are spoiling experience for all the other who just want to enjoy the game.good work all together continue to inprove and maybe one day you can have better game than GTAV,Recommended
The game is decent. Still needs a lot of work. Looks bad on GTX 1080. Bullet wounds are not very realistic. Too much blood and little damage. Literally have to shoot someone 20 times to kill them. Still too arcady for a game that claims to step away from the arcade element of H1. Also the movement and physics are horrendous same as ARMA series. Fun with friends.,Recommended
if rly want to buy such shooting games at least tell your freinds to buy too so you can play with your friends not solo...,Recommended
700 hours!One of the most intense fun games i've ever played. What an insane idea very addicting very energetic perfectly balanced. Game never repeats itself always new starts. It has some minor issues everyone knows this but dam the good time you have makes you over look it all. 11/10,Recommended

This is my third time editing my review of PUBG. The other versions have both been negative but these days the future of PUBG has started to look better. A lot of glitches have been fixed and the whole game is just feeling better.As an example the new weapon skins have added some nice extra content also new scopes and the SLR are pretty nice.At the moment i can already recommend to try the game because its not so broken anymore.There are still some moments when it feels like the enemy you are shooting at doesnt take any damage but it is just sometimes.So my opinion on PUBG atm is pretty nice.+ its not fortnite,Recommended
i love it,Recommended

5/7 would place 95th again.,Recommended
good overall game optimization is needed,Recommended
All I can say about this game is that it's very addicting. You don't (or at least I don't) feel mad when I die. I just feel the urge to play more. The gun mechanics are good the variety of attachments are simply amazing and especially with friends this game can be a lot of fun. However it is an early access title. It has its problems. The main one is the optimization. It does not run as well as it should. There is also a case of de sync. However the devs have said that they are working on these problems. If you are perturbed by these problems wait for the optimization patch. But I fully recommend this game without a doubt.,Recommended
The game is just awesome it keeps getting better and better since its an early access and in fact they do keep adding content and fixing things. You wont regret it for the price im just afraid that is not worth 60 dolars just yet but take into consideration that it will cost you more once it gets out of early access without a doubt.Not for nothing is the top 3 game most played in Steam and the top 3 most streamed game in Twitch.,Recommended
Very good game would recomend installing this on an ssd,Recommended
Addictive as hell. And fun with a group of friends.I would totally recommend.4/5,Recommended

Great potential in this game. However there is a plethora of bugs and hacking. This wouldn't bother me so much pre live launch but it seems the game has worsened it regards to bugs and hacking. Great team oriened shooter game just disappointly buggy and hacker ridden.,Recommended
"This game is quite awesome i put off buying it for quite some time because it was ""just another dayz clone"" from what i thought. Its so much more. I am surprised the reviews are mixed it should be in the high 80's to 90's percentile! The vids dont do it justice when youre playing with friends/family. Even solo is great!

"Upon Just passing 800 hours I felt a need to get rid of my older bare review of the game (Which was posted in March of 2017).PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Places the player in a large open environment with 90 100 other REAL people. The objective? Be the last man (Or team) standing. And how do you get that done? Parachute down with everyone else into these environments scavange kill and loot what ever and wherever you can.I can honestly say after 100's of hours I am still VERY much enjoying the game and can find myself sitting down and putting in a 4 8 hour session of games with friends over the weekend over and over again. The variety of guns attatchments and just sheer options avaliable to you the player really increases the uniqueness of every game you play. Each of these attachments guns medical items etc can serve different situations/playstyles and environments better than others and have their own list of pros/cons attached to them and ultimently can all be used effectively depending on how much time the player takes to learn and practice with them. The two maps currently in the game offer their own (Albiet small) changes than the other. (Miramar taking place in a desert map Offering a unique pickup truck Van Sawed off Shotgun revolver and winchester. While Erangel is more of an island of hills and trees offer the DP 28 Machine gun Dacia it's own revolver as well as a jeep).In terms of where it sits among the other games in the genre I place this among the top. I find the game to continue to be improved expanded upon and tweaked. Something a lot of early access games have failed to do. These updates and tweaks have not stopped with the end of its early access period. The more clunky at times movement and controls are met with a more realistic approach to the guns damage and ballistics create a feel that leans more towards ARMA than H1Z1.And on a final note as of writing this with 800+ hours I have yet to encounter a cheating experience. The closest thing to being ""Cheated"" I have had was early on in development buildings would sometimes not load in and you would be able to see through them I have not encountered or seen this bug in about 3 months. The game takes a lot of hate for being overflowed with Hackers as well as chinese players and its option to buy cosmetic crates. As you read above I have yet to encounter a hacker and while yes it would seem many asia players can be found on NA/EU and other Regions I have yet to see it impact my gameplay other than not being able to understand them. I play with my friends and we Do not pick up random players if we are short a 4th (3 man squad option avaliable) And I play solo if a friend is not online to duo with Avoiding the chance of being paired with careless players players I cannot understand (mic less Foriegn language to myself etc) would strongly suggest taking the same approach to have the best experience. Lastly The cosmetic crate system (Earned with in game curency OR purchased via the market) is a nice addition to the game The items and crates earned in game are marketable ranging from a few cents to several 100 $'s. There is no in game benefit to these crates other than a choice of clothing to wear (no defensive bonus). I personally have Found this to be an enticing way to keep myself playing. I have been able to purchase games such as Rainbow Six Siege Dragon Ball FighterZ) and more copies of the game for my friends because of these crates and cosmetic items. Cannot complain about being able to make more than I have spent on the game Without spending an extra penny for any other reason than wanting to.The best Battle Royal Experience to date Only matched by its foundation created in the Arma Modding community by PlayerUnknown as well. 9.5/10STRONG RECOMENDATION",Recommended

Good solid PVP fun. Always more fun with friends the dynamic of the game changes from solo to duo to squad. Not for people who hate losing.,Recommended
I've spent over 100 hours into the game and can tell you its fun alone or with a squad of comrades. Pros + vehicles+ scvenging +even playing field+ voice interaction with other players than team+ Chicken Dinner is the ultimate bragging right Cons no mic mean no call outs Some Glitches( Minor still in beta? I am not perfect so this is meh) No cross platform yet... some loot boxes that are randomly generated for you to open require a 2.50 fee (USD) your friends will always ask you to play one more ( this is not a joke)aLL IN ALL a 7 out of 7 game I recommend it if your an avivd fps looking for their next thrill. also tip (Save your bp. The loot boxes cost reset every week to 700. Buy only 2 per week unless you play all the time then go for more I guess,Recommended

I genuinely enjoy the game. Playing with friends is fun and great. However without region lock a thing that should be implemented due to chinese players and the poor optimization though its gotten better I can see how new players may find it undesirable. You guys focused more on getting your loot box system functioning than the actual gameplay and optimization. Please change your gameplan and fix your game. You have a great oppurtunity here dont squander it.,Recommended
addicting 9/11 still think fortnite is better lmao,Recommended
This is one of the best action games ever. It combines the best aspects of H1Z1 (especially king of the hill) and DayZ and drops the boring stuff like crafting. The game is full of moments made by the player and at points feels like you're in the middle of Micheal Bay's new movie. What we're left with is a hunger games esque strategic shooter that is amazing even in early access. Not only this but there are promising updates coming out now and being promised for the future.Overall PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS offers fans of action games and strategic shooters alike an experience to remember.,Recommended
This game is my first try in the genre and i love it. The gameplay itself is fantastic. The only thing stopping me from playing this a LOT more is that there needs to be more rewards or progression outside of the game. Perhaps you can receive a free chest each day for logging on and playing one game. Perhaps create a shop full of appealing cosmetics that you would want to save up and buy for your character. This could provide a greater incentive for players to play the game more often.,Recommended

So I got PUBG for christams for a new game to play in 2018! It's a totaly great game and i really enjoy playing it. The game is great for it's price and not to expensive. I recomend it! But don't give up just becuse you lose your first match. The game is based on experiance and tactics. You will find better tactics as you play!I recomend to play it with friends becuse you can team up and get a way better gaming experiance!Buy it!!,Recommended
This game takes skill. I came in with little to no skills on fps games except some hours in FO4 which is a lot different. But unlike a lot of battle royale games ranging from old to PUBG clones are boring if you aren't good. I haven't won a round and don't have many kills but I still really enjoy the game. You don't need to be a pro gamer to play this you do need to be really good to win. But it's still very fun.,Recommended

Sounds like PUBGYou are black screened until the end of the plane? Sounds like PUBGYour character ends up in the ground and you can't get out? That's PUBGThese are bugs with the most recent patch. I would also like to see more content. I know you all have a new map coming out and that is really cool! I want to see more variance in the game too I think the new event modes are a good start.,Recommended

How am I addicted to this game? The game is so simple yet so fun. The slow pace looting phase makes it enjoyable if you play with friends as you can chit chat/meme along the way (unlike other shooters I play). However if you're going solo the game can be a little bit tense if you don't know what you're doing.Pros fun with friends satisfying gun mechanics better optimized since early access game will recieve more updates in the future (10 year plan)Cons netcode issues as of v1.0 harsh environment for newbies quite demanding in terms of PC specs,Recommended

This game is an absolute roller coaster. Firstly it is so much fun to play with friends it pumps you up with adrenaline each time you get shot or when you finally get a kill. However the downside it that there are way too many hackers (mainly people from asia) that just ruin the game for you... plus the fact that bluehole dont give a about hackers ruining the gameplay for us legit players. If you have friends that own this game and you would like to play with them i suggest you buying it straight away.. otherwise if you dont have any friends who play pubg then i dont really recommend buying it.overall score 7.5/10if bluehole did fix some issues in the game.. such as hackers and the horrible engine.. then i would have given it a 8/10(BTW IF YOU HATE CAMPERS.. THIS GAME IS NOT FOR YOU MAN OR GIRL OR WOMAN OR BOY) ),Recommended
i like this game it has a fun why to servive .its much better with friends ..,Recommended
Fun game if you don't take it too seriously. Would be better if they would region lock the game so I can play with other players that speak english. Everytime I play with random players they're always chinese and don't speak english.,Recommended

Well here are the pros and cons of the game for me Pros Fun and Thrilling Game Can change through TPP and FPP with a single button Large map to Explore (There are 2 Large Maps I Think right now) Has Gun Physics such as Recoil so it applies more Challenge You Can Earn Steam Wallet Money A Paid game!(Why is this in Pros? Because many of the kids who will just cry and cry because you killed them can't afford the game)Cons Needs Mid End PC for the Graphics (sad for thise who has a Low End Budget Rig) Low chance of Winning (OF COURSE MEN) Still Has Bugs Rendering Delay may Cause you to be stuck on a Wall or Something (Everything should be prepared once the game loads) Those who have Better Rigs has a Better Advantages because getting at Very low Graphics may cause them to see you in Grass(You know what I mean) Servers are stil LaggyWell Overall it is a Good game and I Recommend it for thos who like FPS games or Battle Royale!! ) ),Recommended

"To be honest I really did not pick up PUBG for a year since I felt like the game was too slow and it took a long time to get into a match. Yet I gave it a chance and I put some time into it I liked it after a while. What really made me come back to it was the new updated version for a much faster paced game called the ""Mini Royale"" which I felt much more comfortable in I even seemed to enjoy the bigger maps. I realized that PUBG is not meant to be fast paced and I found a way to enjoy the way the game works. Pick it up give it a chance.",Recommended
Never posted a review for a game yet but why not.I've gone from loving this game to hating it to back to loving it.Pros First unique gametype added to fps/third person shooters in literally years... RPG Elements can be felt too because of having to find and collect items to have a better chance at winning the game as well as eliminating enemies and taking all of they're items to better equip yourself to survive sort of like a morphing leveling system. mmo level FPS (there aren't many good ones out there)Cons Glitchy and requires a fairly decent gaming setup to run without any flaws and usually running everything on low except for the draw distance will lead to the best performance ingame which means the game doesn't look amazing unless your running a 4ghz processor with at least 8gigs of ram and happen to have a GTX 1080 GPU or equivalent graphics card. The game actually does look amazing when all the graphics settings are on high but unless you have the system to handle it you'll experience FPS lag and slower ingame interactions and maybe even crash more frequently but the main attraction to this game is the gameplay style imo not the way it looks. Lots of controls and the better your control system is setup the better you will play. (mouse with extra buttons does wonders since your other hand can only do so much and still be used for moving around at the same time) Loot system while this is an essential element to the new gameplay type (survival/battle royale) it can also be a pain to spend 10 15 minutes finding all your gear only to get headshot by someone which is why I play almost exclusively on the new map Miramar it has more consistent loot spawns and the high level loot spawns are easier to find as well as scopes so when you do get caught out in the middle of a field you'll at least hopefully have something you can see your enemy with and shoot back instead of just a shotgun.I'm really hoping they fix the original map (Erangel)'s loot spawns because right now they are ridiculous compared to the new map (Miramar) to the point that the only place worth going to is the millitary base because it always has the best stuff but because its so popular it often becomes a massive drop zone and theres not a weapon for everyone if everyone goes there. The loot spawns were better on that map in early access but they tweaked something or broke something and now its always a hassle to even find an AR with a decent sight on it. Plus the maps terrain is pretty bland so finding a hill or gully to hide in is almost impossible and your left with trees to hide behind and some rocks which are pretty scarce and its a bad situation to be in if you still have a pistol and a shotgun at that point. (why the hell are shotguns so popular on this map please tell me bluehole they are literally EVERYWHERE)My other little problem with the game is the aim modes which turned me off from the game but I since adapted by using a better mouse. Putting two different aiming options on the right mouse button is ridiculous when your trying to fight in CQB. (Hold for better hip fire aim or toggle for full aim down sights ADS ) Half the time I'd end up stuck in ADS mode and getting killed because I couldnt click my right mouse button fast enough to escape that mode. Now instead both my aim modes are set to hold for ADS and Aiming Hip Fire mode and use different mouse buttons... took some getting used to but makes quick ADS and moving around way easier and is great if your used to normal FPS games where your used to aiming in and out of sights fast.,Recommended

"Battlegrounds is an action game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royal a type of large scale deathmatch where players fight to be the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo or with a small team of two or four people. In either case the last person or team left alive wins the match.Each match starts with players parachuting onto an island approximately 8 by 8 kilometres (5.0 mi 5.0 mi) in size 1 from a plane without any items outside of customizable clothing options that they select prior to a match. Once they land players can search buildings and other sites to find weapons vehicles armor clothing and other equipment. These items are distributed throughout the map at the start of a match with certain high risk zones having better equipment. 2 Players then proceed to either stay hidden to avoid being killed or hunt down other players whilst continuing to search for more equipment. Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well. At random a plane will fly over various parts of the playable map and drop a loot package containing items which are normally unobtainable during normal gameplay. The package also emits a highly visible red smoke drawing interested players near it. 2 Players can opt to play either from the first person or third person perspective each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness. 2 Every few minutes the playable ""safe"" area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage over time and eventually being eliminated in game the players see this as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time. 3 This forces players into more confined areas and increases the chance of encounters with the surviving players. During the course of the match random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed posing a threat to players that remain in that area. 4 In both cases players are warned a few minutes before these events giving them time to relocate to safety. On average a full round takes no more than 30 minutes. 5 At the completion of each round players gain in game currency based on how long they survived and how many other players they had killed. The currency is used to purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character customization.Lead designer Brendan Greene better known by his online handle PlayerUnknown had previously created the ARMA 2 mod DayZ Battle Royale an offshoot of popular mod DayZ and inspired by the film Battle Royale. 6 Greene had been inspired to create the Battle Royale mod as he found that in most multiplayer first person shooter games there was too much repetition as maps were small and easy to memorize. He wanted to create something with more random aspects so that players would not know what to expect creating a high degree of replayability this was done by creating vastly larger maps that could not be easily memorized and using random item placement across it. 7 Greene also was inspired by an online competition for DayZ called Survivor GameZ which featured a number of Twitch.tv and YouTube streamers fighting until only a few were left as he was not a streamer himself Greene wanted to create a similar game mode that anyone could play. 7 When DayZ became its own standalone title Greene transitioned development of the Battle Royale mod to ARMA 3. Sony Online Entertainment (now the Daybreak Game Company) had become interested in Greene's work and brought him on as a consultant to develop on H1Z1 which was split into two separate games the survival mode H1Z1 Just Survive and the battle royal like H1Z1 King of the Kill around February 2016. 8 Greene had completed his work with Daybreak around the time of this split and was contacted by Chang Han Kim of the South Korean developer Bluehole offering him the opportunity to work on a new battle royal concept. Within a week Greene had flown out to Bluehole's headquarters in Korea to discuss the options and a few weeks later became the creative director of Bluehole. He moved to South Korea to oversee development. 7 According to Greene this is the first time a Korean game studio has brought aboard a foreigner for a creative director role and while a risk he states his relationship with Bluehole's management is strong allowing Greene's team to work autonomously with minimal oversight. 5 Development began in early 2016 with plans to have the game ready within a year. 9 Kim served as executive producer for the game. 7 Bluehole started with a team of about 35 developers supporting Greene's work but which as of June 2017 has expanded to 70 and expected to increase again to 90 with a new studio based in Madison Wisconsin Greene said that many of these developers are voluntarily putting in longer work hours into the game due to their dedication to the project and not by any mandate from Greene or Bluehole's management. 7 10 In addition to Bluehole Greene also credits Bohemia Interactive the developers of ARMA and DayZ for support with motion capture animations via their Czech studio. 10 BATTLEGROUND IS A GOOD GAME TRY IT",Recommended

It manages to approach the Battle Royale style death match made popular by games like DayZ with relative simplicity without sacrificing the essence of the hardcore survival sim creating a tight focused and no frills experience that places it leagues above the competition.Battlegrounds wastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as up to 100 players join a server and pick their moment to jump out of a plane and parachute onto a large 8x8 km island. Even this first act is a critical decision and must be part of your strategy jumping early lets you hit the ground first giving you a jump on the competition but may also place you farther from the center of the arena where the fighting must inevitably funnel towards. Jumping late might give you some distance from other players giving you some early breathing room before entering the fray. Jumping right into the center especially in large cities where most players drop will place you right in the middle of the action.The tension mounts during the descent as you get a good look at the swarm of players in your vicinity but things really pick up the moment you hit the ground as everybody scrambles for weapons and gear and the killing begins right from the get go. Backpacks for holding more items a handful of protective gear like helmets and police vests healing items melee weapons and a good mix of firearms are in good supply.Item distribution is randomized but you can t count on finding a good gun early keeping you safe. It isn t out of the ordinary for someone with only a pistol to take down someone with a fully loaded SCAR L assault rifle since good gear is only half the battle the other half is wit. As players outsmart each other in deadly games of cat and mouse those still standing are forced into ever closer proximity within the confines of a deadly ever shrinking force field until just one is left alive. Victory is an exhilarating reward matched only by the suspense that emerges from the battle to achieve it. But even if you die early jumping into a new game is always quick and easy. (Kill cams are wisely omitted to avoid cheating but you do have the option of entering spectate mode for surviving teammates.)The deadly moving force field that contains the arena and occasional airstrikes marked with red on the minimap add a consistent sense of purpose and with it an exciting set of options. You might want to prioritize reaching the center to avoid each incremental reduction in size of the survivable area move slowly along the borders to pick off stragglers as they rush into the open to avoid the oncoming doom or even hide in a building until you absolutely have to move letting everyone else kill each other so you don t have to. An aggressive approach is just as viable as a cautious defense and the practicality of both playstyles is refreshingly liberating bringing new sets of challenges that are just as fun to plan around and tackle as the next.The incentives to stay on the move no matter your chosen pace forces ever more dangerous encounters with increasingly skilled (or lucky) survivors condensing the action and ending a match after around 20 minutes before it can get bogged down by campers or other distractions. Action isn t hard to find in Battlegrounds if you re looking for it and impossible to avoid for long when you re not but it manages to put enough space between encounters to keep those quiet tense moments we know and love from games like DayZ intact.While the rules are always the same factors like where you choose to land which items spawn where or how fast you can find a weapon or a backpack or a scope keep every match new and exciting. A large map and an abundance of loot means hunting for a weapon isn t a frustrating task but instead an opportunity to weigh your options and pick your approach for the round. This not only keeps the playing field balanced and fun for everyone but ripe for all sorts of thrilling confrontations.You might find yourself involved in a frantic shootout in the woods or on either end of a deadly hunt across one of the island s many cities and towns. You might even find yourself holed up in an attic listening for the slightest creak or scrape to indicate a nearby presence shotgun in hand. The use of sound to build tension and alert you to nearby enemies is one of the ways Battlegrounds forces you to stay attentive and tactical rather than treating every round like a Call of Duty style shoot em up. Play long enough and you can learn the subtleties that tip off when another player has been in a place before you an open door or an unusually dense or sparse pile of mismatched loot are telltale signs you should be watching your back. All these layers merge to build a shooter that s as invested in creating a smart nuanced survival experience as it is fun action packed combat.The entire dynamic of both exploration and combat changes drastically by grouping up in the pre game lobby. (Teaming up after you re in game is considered cheating and a potentially bannable offense.) Playing solo brings certain elements to the formula that going in with a partner doesn t and the same goes for trios and four player squads. There might be more freedom and greater opportunity for stealth in going alone but a well coordinated team has more potential for pulling off exciting ambushes and vehicular assaults.The gunplay itself is also great firearms feel good to shoot and are impressively balanced even in Early Access. And while Battlegrounds does retain that military sim clunkiness that s become synonymous with the genre it s just smoothed out enough to keep combat and movement satisfying and accessible to newcomers. A couple of handy hotkeys to cycle weapons switch between third or first person perspective and toggle auto or burst fire for your gun are most of what you need to know. The simple and intuitive UI is also particularly refined which makes looting bodies and swapping items with teammates as easy as a quick click and drag. A number of quality of life features round out even Battlegrounds roughest edges being able to access your inventory and map while on the move and a generous leniency with fall damage stand out as some of the most valuable.Of course Battlegrounds is still Early Access so it does have a few problems you should be aware of. I ve dealt with annoying glitches such as pieces of loot I couldn t pick up wonky collision that has gotten me momentarily stuck in doorways and performance issues like bad latency but game breaking bugs are fortunately rare. The exception to that is an apparently small group of players who have reported frequent crashes something that will hopefully be resolved once it s fully launched. Overall it s a relatively smooth experience especially when compared to most early access games that have only been available for a month or so. While the gameplay Battlegrounds offers now is strong enough to stand on its own additional features I d love to see in the final version include custom servers new maps and a separate practice range for getting a feel for individual guns.PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds has taken the genre popularized by games like DayZ and boiled it down to only its best parts making for quick and accessible rounds of pure hassle free survival based action. Even though it s as rough around the edges as the early access label implies it s absolutely worth playing right now. We ll continue to play as it gets closer to a full launch and revisit this review with updated thoughts once it s out of early access.,Recommended
I love this game It has so much replay ablility quick to learn and an amazing time with freinds or solo. The way loot spawns in certain areas is amazingly done. If you want to best loot you will have to fight for it. The end game zone feel fairly balanced and fun. The servers though need some work have a server side network lag not just me happens to everyone and some freezes that are not client sided. Game needs a bit of work As of this review the game is a bit buggy and cars are too easy to flip over. Had bit bit of texture issues with some fences and rocks. The spectator mode though is very broken aiming down sites puts it in akward postions for the spectator not the player. The battle eye anti cheat for this game works beautifly havent run into any hackers yet. You will need a higher end pc at the moment though because of optimization. Other than that the game is so much fun to play and was worth every pennie. Would highly recemend this game.,Recommended

Love the game. Tactics are just as important as the weapon you have unlike other FPS. The last man standing isn't necessarily the one with the highest kill count meaning playing smart is far more rewarding. Considering it is still in early access it is in a highly playable condition and I recommend it to all who would enjoy a mix of battle royale/hunger games with COD.,Recommended

Added bonus I've met some life long friends and really good people in the pre game lobby and cargo plane drop. In depth profound coverstations aplenty.,Recommended
This game provides a unique battle royale experience that will leave your heart pounding. The combat is realistic and stressful as anything can go right or wrong. But the time looting leading up to combat should be handled with caution as you never know who's waiting to ambush. The randomness of what could happen always has me coming back.Now many players dislike this game because it is too random. Players hate being killed out of the blue with no time to react. My response to those MANY players. Someone has to die randomly or the game would last forever. Don't dislike the game for the soul reason that you may be the one to die... All you can do is take it slow and try to be the one doing the killing.In my opinion PLAYERUNKNOWNS'S BATTLEGROUNDS is the best battle royale game on the market.,Recommended

As long as you don't have a bad computer like me this game is great! I love it's highly realistic look and it's logic of having better loot in bigger and more frequently used areas. One thing to expect is to get killed out of the blue. Overall I rate this game 8.5/10 stars!,Recommended

"The best Battle Royale game out there. People say not to compare this and Day Z which is true but I'm going to compare the dev teams The dev team for this game doesn't suck. Regular updates with actual meaningful content and needed bug fixes. Game itself is addicting and extremely fun.

Pubg is something that has gained mass popularity very quickly and with that comes reviews that express a very stern love or hate of the game instead of exploring it like most things and seeing the good and bad and deciding which ones matter more to you.I have 200+ hours at the time of writing this review which compared to many others is nothing. If you look through my steam library you will see a pattern common among many users.I purchase games and barely play them or in some cases I do not play them at all. 200+ hours for me is signifigant and that is for a reason.I want to start off with the bad things.The game isn't the most optimized and can be hard on even beefy machines. I get 40 50 fps on high settings with a roughly 3 year old machine. I have a very good internet connection and I rarely have any server issues. Any that I have experienced were steam wide and not exclusive to me. I have been playing online games since the original quake so none of this is new or unexpected to me. lag happen. there are 100 players. de sync is going to happen. servers are only going to get better and better as the game is developed. I personally have not ran into enough server issues to warrant a complaint.many complaints I read do not consider the technical requirments of such servers and the net code required. Rainbow Six Seige had one of the worst party systems I have experienced for over a year and that is made by Triple A developer with years and years of online gaming experience.some people simply won't like the game play. that does not make it a bad game. I do not enjoy many games that people leave positive reviews for. I understand it just isn't my cup of tea. Yes you can land and get killed in the first 10 seconds. As you learn the game you can figure out how to avoid situations more consistently. Most complaints I read in terms of gameplay come down to lack of skill not the game it self.The addition of events have really spiced the game up for me. A couple examples lately have been shotgun/pistol only matches in small circles. Another was 10 person squads.I really enjoy Pubg. The challenge of it and the open world is a ton of fun. Coming across some awesome loot grabbing a vehicle and getting into epic gun fights is awesome. As a 20+ year veteran of pc gaming. Pubg has been one of my favorite PC Games to come out ever.,Recommended
Lots of fun and addicting. Love this game!,Recommended
This is a list of my pros and cons in this game.Pros.It's very addicting and you end up playing for like 3 hours on end.The loot drops are very well put and balanced.Each weapons feel powerful and good in their own way even the pistols.The map tells you exactly where you are and how far away from the safe zone you are.There are a lot of vehicle spawns which makes the game fun.The gunfights are extremely intense at times and it makes you feel like you're in veitnam or something.The drop zones are balanced so people can't go too the same place every game.Complete gun customization.The bandage system is well put and seems fair.You have the option to revive your teammates._______________________________Cons.The game crashes a lot if you don't have it on low settings.If you run over the smallest bump in a car you'll go flying and most likely die.you can get stuck in the giant well at the ruins if you fall/land in there.No optimization yet BUT it will be added.The game freezes sometimes and once it does that the only way to fix it is to restart your computer which is very annoying.FPS drops are insane at times. ____________________With all the pros and cons out there now i'd have to say i recommend this game because it's still in early access so you gotta give it a chance because i'm sure most of the bugs will be fixed in a few updates.,Recommended
I play this game too much.Pretty decent early access game. I've hit my dollar per hour mark for sure. If you can deal with lag spikes every once and a good while then you can probably have fun with this game. I play on 70 Kb/s down and still get great performance and have won games on it.,Recommended
Hard and stressfull at the start however after some time playing this gets only better. The fact that I never rage also helps.Some things are buggy this and the optimization needed are the only problems for me.,Recommended
Great game!,Recommended

Waow what an adrenaline rush!! If you want to play a game that might give you a heart attack look no further! Only downside is that there are still some bugs in this game but it's getting better.,Recommended
A review for this game is meaningless because who doesn't know about this game. Even if you haven't played it you have seen someone else play it and probably already know if you would enjoy this game or not. The game is pretty much everything it advertises to be. Its an enjoyable battle royale/last man standing game that throws 100 players onto an island (and soon a desert) to fight it out. PUBG is a very fun game that has held my interest for about 250 hours. I would say im pretty bored with it now but I find myself coming back to it everynow and again with a friend or squad which is the most enjoyable aspect of this game teamplay.If you are interested in playing this game I would say go for it but do it quickly. The devs are pushing the esports scene for this game way too hard for what it is. The best part of a battle royale style game is the randomness and unfairness of each game. Somegames you find amazing stuff some games you dont. Flight path airdrops bomb zones area circles vehicle spawns loot quality &amp quantity are all random and is the main reason these games don't get repetitive quickly. Pushing esports would lead to these aspect being somewhat balanced essentially killing the game. At its current state though its a really enjoyable game and I hope the devs make the right decisions going forward. 7/10,Recommended

This is by far my most played game on Steam Just the need to satisfy my blood lust in a good game where anything can happen you never know I love the headshots I get with snipers the spray down on squads It's just absolutly amazing. For me the game does run good sometimes servers are just laggy sometimes but it's okay RNG I rarely get snipers most of the time I land at a house with someone they have a automatic and me a pistol which is bad luck for me always. Anyway I actually do recomend this game if you seem intrigued you may suck at first but you'll get the hang of it pretty fast unlike my friends who don't really kill a whole lot me having to carry and one guy who just wants to play and doesn't care to win He says its a chilling game.

"I bought this game hoping to get some multiplayer fun with friends out of this game but actually to even get to play the multiplayer game you have to first beat the loading screen boss. It can take a few tries and you may need to update drivers or change settings the problem is there is no real good strategy guide for this since each game is unique and randomly generated. The worst part is you are timed when fighting this boss because while other players get to move freely your character is stuck standing still with no chance to move around or even defend yourself and now your character will automatically get sent out of the plane free falling into whatever challenges awaits. Sometimes you character will drown while fighting the loading screen other times you get attacked by a guy just trying to get some extra BP from AFK kills. After Finally beating the loading screen boss I thought ""OK! time to have some fun with friends!"" but here comes the second boss his name is ""The rendering"". the rendering boss uses a variety of attacks ranging from low poly buildings which if entered can make a player stuck in something that appears inside or on top of the character and some obstacles just not spawning at all which your character will just run into what appears to be an invisible wall. After beating the second boss I was pretty worn out but it was time to play the game. But little did I know that the hardest boss would be my teamates! If you find better loot than them or maybe they are just feeling silly they might shoot you or hit you with a frying pan in the head one shotting you whilst they scream ""would anybody care for some EGGS!?!?!""10/10 would like some eggs",Recommended

"People really like to make this game seem like its a whole lot better than h1z1 king of kill its good in its own right.....but thats about it i like the game about the same and there pretty similar. the biggest diffrences between the two are the weapon choices/customization and the play style h1z1 is all about playing agressive and going for the win with the highest amount of kills. while PUBG is alot more passive and playing by the book of cover and keeping your distance as well as choosing your fights carefuly altough kills are still a factor people dont play as agressive as h1 where they try and pick a fight every chance they can. if you hate ""campers"" then this game is not for you theres plenty of people/teams who will camp a house roof woods etc while adsing a door waiting for your poor soul to walk up unaware of the danger. game is fun alone even more so with friends its got its share of bugs and currently heavy dsync when fighting close range against other players. overall a fun game 7/10 alone 9/10 with friends",Recommended

This is the fined tuned version of H1Z1 King Of The Kill and it toppled CSGO and many other valve games in a few days of release but now after a year of the game being released there has been some things that were questionable of bluehole to do 1. Adding new cases that could only be unlocked by keys to earn them even more money but in doing so they have put off some fans of the game to other battle royl titles.2. Adding the pass for the new map is a bad move as they are just ripping off the battle pass from fortnite yet i believe this is as revenge for fortnite ripping PUBG off (THATS WHAT BLUEHOLE THINKS SO I PROPOSED A THEORY DON'T KILL ME)3. The game has been out for a long time now so why hasn't there been any major updates to help with optimisation this game was once running smooth but now not so much.4. Adding uneeded cosmetics there was already an abundant amount of trenchcoats U DO NOT NEED TO ADD MOAR5. Region locking China this may stop alot of hackers but ur also killing a part of a large community China is one of the highest population countries and is a large part of your player countLooking past these problems i still believe PUBG is a great game that people should try out just because of gameplay,Recommended
"Typical landings at Hacienda/School/Ruins I'm landing here we should stick together! *Squad lands as far apart as possible* ""I CAN'T FIND A GUN! SOMEONES CHASING ME WITH A SHOTGUN"" I go to help my squadmate get shot by teammate of shotgun guy. Talk to guy who killed me. Get BMed. Watch as all but the one teammate who hid in a room gets killed off. Last teammate goes on rampage and kills everyone. Last teammate kills himself with nade and we que into a new game. ""Ooooooh we're going over Hacienda we should jump there. We take it more often than we die."" Que into a new game 5 minutes later.*Edit*So all jokes aside I love this game. Take it from my 2000 hours (1800 in the base game and 300 in the test and experimental). This is my favorite game and i've met some amazing people visited a different state and got invited to a wedding in another country because of this game. I've never had the same joy from winning or the frustration from a close second in any other game than i have with this one. Its amazing and it still could be even better. People who talk about like its paid to win or that the devs are greedy are missing the business aspect of this game. They aren't greedy but they still need to get paid just like everyone else. How many of you would continue to work for free or on reduced pay to an ungrateful and hateful community? Most of the copies they're going to be able to sell have been sold. They aren't going to be able to sell another 30 million copies and making that extra money back money which they weren't just sitting on. They're spending it on expansion advertising making new content working on performance and optimization a bunch of new things. But that origional money dried up so they have to come out with a new way to make money which would be loot crates and the more recent event pass (which i bought gladly and with zero regrets). This is how they continue to make money to keep on updating the game paying for servers everything that goes into this game is made through the lootcrate and hopefully that will be phased out by the event pass. The issue is that gamers are the most impatient people in the world. The game was made on bad netcode and it wasn't supposed to be the success that it turned into so it wouldn't have mattered that much. But they were a success and those quirky glitches and things in the netcode that made pubg the quirky flavor of the month came to bite them in the and they can't easily fix them. Yes they did not do what they promised to the extent i and many others wanted it but what did you expect from a small studio like bluehole that had little to no experience with fps games that then became a runaway success. If they were to fix the game they would have to smash the castle and start anew which they can't do because they're too big. To satisfy the harrassing and loud players (who do nothing but spam the community announcements with what they want added in the game that they feel like they deserve because they feel entitled to a one time purchase and continued content to last them hundreds of hours that costs bluehole tens of thousands of man hours making) they had to make promises they simply couldn't keep and that lost them the trust of the player base. But a lot of things these people complain about is stupid and unrealistic like the cosmetics. If you don't want the cosmetics don't get it. Its simple as that. I will continue to buy the event passes though because i for one think that they're an amazing alternative to lootcrates and give me a reason to play the game because I want those outfits since I think they're awesome. You do you boo boo. But while i understand it doesn't mean i'm not frustrated from things like lag desync being killed behind cover stupid glitches that cause me to die after i've got 15 kills and i can potentially break my record of 19. Its frustrating. I wish it would be fixed. I'm typically in the top 100 in duo and squad tpp the highest I've ever made was 28 in duos and i kept on losing games after i got that high to people who were killing me behind cover chinese es who abuse the poor coding to get easy kills hackers (though bluehole has done an amazing job with them recently they are still there and occasionally i catch them) and other things that could be avoided if they were able to fix the netcoding. But they can't. Because every single mistake or misstep they make is put under a microscope and they're an evil company that was only trying to take your money. Yeah they're trying to take money from the person who spent $30 on the game spent 400 hours on it that they mostly enjoyed but had a couple bad games and decided to leave a bad review because the game isn't perfect and up to their standards because they've been playing Cod and battlefield which haven't changed at all in the last 7 years. But i'm rambling because i'm updating this drunk as after reading stupid negative reviews. If you want a better and more cohesive explaination watch WTFMoses' video https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 96nUghwWGJI&amp t 1sDeuces buy the game and find some randoms who you like and who like you. This game wasn't meant to be played alone. The first 400 hours are the toughest but you'll get a win in occasionally and once you get good you'll be slaughtering kids left and right. You could be the next Shroud if you decide to just buy the game despite the negative reviews left by bitter people who feel entitled to more and expect more from a company that wasn't supposed to ever be known outside of those weird indie game players.",Recommended
there are still hackersssss ban them in a custom games there are hacker and we can't report them,Recommended
Best multiplayer game i have ever played 8/10 cuz fo some bugs and cheaters and not so good fps on good pc/s,Recommended
Great game! Yeah it's buggy but it's getting better and better after every update. At the core the game is really thrilling and the long games ( 30 mins if you survive) makes you really stressful. You really don't want to die and start over again which makes you super alert and defensive. I like the fact that it rewards positionning over plain point and clicking it feels like a real survival game instead of a regular FPS.People are complaining about devs but in the last month they've been really active. Three massive updates did lots of great change rubberbanding (in test server at least) is getting better hitbox could get a little bit of work and the game often crashes at the beginning (which is not so bad because you can rejoin the game without any issue).I find myself thinking about this game alot when I'm at work or college... so yeah needs polishing but it's still my favorite game as of right now.Oh my specs (I run at 80 120 depending where) I5 4690K R9 390 8gb RAM Evo SSDLike I said I'm crashing and I get some rubberbanding at the very beggining of a game but everything else works fine.,Recommended

This game is fun and exciting but the lack of focus on countering the rampant cheating spree has made this game far worse from what the game has been hyped to a year ago but alas this problem and all the bugs glitches and rubberbanding still need to be fixed in order for this game to be as it is a fun game.

UPDATED APRIL 22 2018 The game is even better no that they have re added weather a new game mode *LIMITED TIME ONLY* system they added to the game and even more. I recommend buying this game. Oh and just for the record although im not fond of fortnite this review is completely unbiased and I will challenge if bluewhale up,Recommended

The best worst game ever made,Recommended
Also known as the Long Distance Running Simulator. Hehe seriously though this is Battle Royale the others are pale imitations. The game play revolves around you and or your squad being dropped from a plane onto an island where you have to find weapons and defend yourself in an ever decreasing play area. Every one else is hostile! There can be only one winner.There are many tactics to playing the game but not one that can guarantee a win each time there is luck and skill required to get the Winner Winner Chicken Dinner but the most important is time in game. Many new players join the game and get frustrated with the brutality of the game. If you new don t drop in high density areas )Make sure you play with good headphones with directional sound! You will need it.Would I recommend? Yes I play most weeks/nights and is one of my fave games.Pros Hard Core (if you like easy go play Fortnite)Large selection of weaponsGood selection of cars motorbike and boatsVoIP works well as long as you set it correctly in you settings (discord is better)Large MapsAtmospheric yes yes I know but the game has a better feel that the other Royale games and the replay system is just awesome to play with.Cons You need a good high end PC to get the best out of the game a 1050ti is a minimum I would say.Cheats sadly it is rife with them the devs are trying their best but it is wack a moleLatency issues with the servers are still persistence.Hit reg because of the above is sometime way out of sync.Some sounds are way too high (for example stand next to the sea and you would think a storm was rising but it s a pond)Large Maps (yes its in both! Needs more bike/car spawns on them or pedal bikes!)Special Events (this is new and not well thought out 8 player teams for example but you can only have a squad of 4. So if you have 8 mates wanting to play together you cant. Yes a fubar),Recommended
Alright the game came out of early access and I can say they did some major changes Most of the bugs got fixThey added new climbing system(which is pretty good)Less server issues and so on.Overall the game is enjoyable and fun to play with firends or solo. Highly recommended if you like competitive games. Its 8/10 for me.,Recommended

Product received for free. This game is a lot of fun. You definitely have to stay on your toes and never stay still because late game there are a lot of snipers. If you're new to the game just accept that people will see you before you see them in most cases and give it a few days before you get too frustrated. I would definitely recommend playing with friends if you can. Duo's and Squads are a lot of fun and it helps to learn the ropes with someone else. This game is also very life like there is drop on your bullets you can hear where people are around you (like the floor and room of an appartment and whether their crouched prone or even bare foot) you can also customize your weapons with silencers magazines scopes etc. You can also do friendly fire! So don't shoot your friends unless it's at their pan.,Recommended
Great game worth buying,Recommended
I you like to play game like Arma or DayZ for the PVP but hate the long down times and preparation for it this is the game for you just the action and none of the waiting.,Recommended
I'd like to say that PUBG is a very good game if you have a decent processor and Graphics card and it runs pretty smooth but you'll have the choppy frames in Yasnaya Polyana and other big areas but as the game progresses through trial and error via the test servers the frames are good same with loading but the servers are laggy alot of the times but you get used to it I would recommend this game to all whho like fun and the best game on steam but if you're gonna wait for 1.O release I could'nt blame you. Cya all on the Battlegrounds!,Recommended

this game is great if your looking for reilistic battle royale,Recommended
Probably one of the only games in a long time to keep me hooked for about (700 hours) now. Every game is different and the last circles actually cause heart palpitations. 100% reccomend.,Recommended
Been playing this game since the first month of it's early access release and it's been one of the best experiences I've had in my 9 years of PC gaming. The game developers are committed to pleasing the gaming community who are playing the game with constant updates and implementations of things the community has asked for. (i.e. vaulting lag fixing/optimization...etc) This game can be played totally on your own or you can group up with 1 or 3 other players and jump into a 8km x 8km map that is filled with an infinite amount of opportunities and chances to be the last man standing in a all out battle royale between/with you and 99 other players. The only thing that is a nuissance right now is the amount of hacking but the game is committed to preventing this from continuing with more and more bans each day.Give it a try though! There's a reason there's over 12 million copies sold so far.,Recommended

"So do I reccomend this game? Yes and No.//The ""No"" part.It's basically the other reviews the game is extremely unoptimized and cheaters are running rampant. Especially in the past few days. Out of the 20ish matches I've played in 3 days I've encountered atleast 8 10 blatant cheaters they're not even trying to hide it a lot of people on here have blatant aimbot and are just ruining the game. There's also been a few speed hackers teleporting away and back from me. And the optimazation just speaks for itself...//The ""Yes"" part.The game is outstanding and so sooo much potential. The gunplay although not the best is super fun and for the most part fair (except going against cheaters). Every part of this game is pretty great of course there's bugs and other frustrating parts such as vehicles and some falling glitches. Overall the game is good and has a lot of potential and is going to be a great game once they iron out the bugs. Fingers crossed for the 12th of December that many of these things in my review will be fixed.Thanks for reading! Shadow",Recommended

A week after it's release I explored my store que as always stumbling across this diamond in the rough. At first glance i thought survival rpg mmo cars! and more! ohhh MY! I bought the game instantly without watching the trailer. After i had an initial turn i passed the controls over the my fiends. Not to impressed (mind you this was week one of release) i bribed my mates with extra copies spending more than 150 on extra copies for them so i had teamates to play with. For those out there who doubt love at first site well keep stronge in faith my friends because it does exist. I saw this gem when she was just a baby and instantly took a leap of faith. NOw look at the diamond she shines in glory today! pubg all the way!! dave rn,Recommended

haha shoo shoo bang ban,Recommended
Good game!,Recommended
I have nearly 350 hours and it's time to make a review.PUBG to me is like that perfect balance between an ARMA game and a game like H1Z1. It has that tactical and survival part from ARMA then spiced a little up with some stuff from games like H1Z1. ARMA II is by far one of my favourite games to date so being able to play a game like PUBG that has some of the same aspects as ARMA is amazing.I can nothing but recommed this game but then again at this point I think we all have it(I even own 2 copies) of course the game has it's flaws like any game does.The thrill and the overall experience of being top 10 makes this game so unique feeling your heart pumping faster and faster as people get picked of one by one is one of the greatest feelings in the world and then the storm calms down when you finally get that sweet marinated chicken dinner.Me and many of my friends cannot wait to see what devs and future modders have in store for us I'm mostly hoping for an survival mode or do i dare say an DayZ like mode o Just buy it already. JustKasper,Recommended
Realistic!!!!!,Recommended
Overall i'd recommend the game the contrast beteween looting and the intensity of the last circles or sudden firefights make this game worth playing.Bugs are encoutered rarely and i've only seen a hacker once. All of my deaths feel fair and lack of skill on my part. Other reviewers exaggerate the condition of this game. The game does have issues with stability. I'd say out of 10 games the game crashes atleast once however when you load into the game it plays out fine. Having a good computer with an SSD helps against the stability issues but does not eliminate them. The stability is especially troublesome when playing with four players. PUBG is contrary to other reviews constantly being updated on all fronts not only cosmetics.,Recommended
Love how this game is a combo of H1Z1 and Arma 3 Battle Royal. All the good parts you would find in those games are combined in 1 single game with very little glitches and very good servers compared to the other games. Love the variaty of all the weapons you can find and how it doesn't take forever to get looted up. The only thing I can complain about is the amount of friends you can group up with as for H1Z1 I find that fives are a fair amount of players and realistically who only has 4 friends! 10/10 IGN,Recommended

This game is always ing broken,Recommended
Honestly I really love this game. I gave it a break from back when it had all it's bugs but the game has really shaped up since then. I haven't experienced any of the older bugs I ever had mostly due to the fact that I haven't experienced gameplay in the past 6 months of trying when I queue for a game I end up staring at my character on the main menu before I realise maybe I should just end it all because nothing is ever going right when I launch this game. Absolutely revolutionary microtransactions never seen those before.,Recommended
10/10 would get rekt again,Recommended
Great game lots of fun still playing it daily. Much more fun with friends though if you're on your own it might get a little boring defintely not a single player game. I've put 100 hours into the game and haven't run into one hacker have yet to be kicked out no server issues and the marketplace is for apparel only.,Recommended

Incredible gameplay that keeps me coming back. It has some optimization problems but it's an amazing time with friends. One of my favorite games. Period.,Recommended
"I started playing Fortnite before I started playing PUBG but all my friends insisted I got this game saying it was the Unfortunately my computer would not support these amalgamation of ones and zeroes so I dumped $400+ dollars into computer parts and dicked around until I ended up with a freak of a Frankinstein monster of a computer convicing myself the whole time that it was for improving Overwatch graphics or to be able to run games smoother but no. Deep underneath my inner psyche I knew I was spending away my $8 dollars an hour at a Korean restaraunt to be able to run this game. After weeks of ordering parts and building away like I'm an Egyptian building a pyramid on a diet of glassy bread I finally obtain this grease ball of a game. And Jesus was it fun I was driving around shooting up s like there's no tomorrow. But then I noticed the autism that lyed within. Cars launching into outer space like Saturn V when you hit a rock or getting shot through the skull across the map with a 15x like that one kid from American Sniper. But worst of all was when I kept getting shot from auto targetting by some kid in China that just got home from school and was fitting in a game before chello practice. ""China number one"" I still hear it in my dreams. Fun game with friends though.",Recommended
Great running and door opening simulator!,Recommended
Edit My false ban been lifted after some time communicating with Pubg support team. I hope the update helps to understand.WARNING Before buying the game pay attention to forums. There is a lot players getting banned for no reason in game their support won't investigate false ban.Also won't tell you what not to do based on the banned cause so you can understand the reason. They will unfair way say you cheated and never will care to check your proof of not cheating/recent game that you played and so on before confirming. Before a false ban for cheating or whatever the cause of it be on the ban. They won't temporary ban you they will ban you permanently and see it as they banned correctly. I don't recommand any new players if you care for your steam account. As a victim of false ban and no investigation from Pubg Support Team I can only warn and hope for Pubg and Bluehole to look onto this matter. Before that don't buy this game unless you want to risk your steam account.,Recommended
"Server machine B R O K E but 69/10 gameplay. Server lag is a hh and 3 quarters but when the internet decides to be on your side this game is fireeee dawg. This game also decided to add a muhhfukiin uhhhh B A T T L E P A S S. OOOOF ya know if i had $10 that going straight to my honda civic. Cause aint worth it here. Its purely to make other little jealous cosmetics and like BP and BP BOOSTS. How wicked. But the maps are free. HOWEVER they have the audacity to make the map playlists so that you either play the 4x4 Sanhok map OR the normal sized maps. The problem with that is YOU CAN'T CHOSE WHICH NORMAL SIZED MAP YOU WANT TO PLAY. Like FOREALLLLL my G U Y? Miramar can eat the between the toes of a construction worker.

"I am having a lot of fun with this game. I'm not one to play much PVP but this game creates a new situation every time you play.It is early access and I have seen some bugs. Such as not being able to switch weapons being stuck in a certain mode like crouch. I feel I've been unfairly killed more than once such as when in a house at the top of the stairs after clearing the upstairs and somehow someone magically shoots me. I am also a little ticked off that I worked so hard to get into the top 10 and the stats don't show it. That is hugely disappointing. What is the point of stats if you don't record them accurately? A top ten leap frogs you literally tens of thousands of places on the leader board.There is also some lag and that might explain the unfair kills. Like how else do you explain unloading a pistol in someone's face and then they kill you with a punch? Yes a punch (yeah so don't give up if you are empty handed you can still win!).When flying over the map there is a huge disconnect between where the plane is marked on the map and where you really are so make sure to decide when to jump based on what you see not what the map shows.All things considered I can't seem to stop playing this game. I keep thinkg shoulda coulda and ""I'll do better this time!""HIghly recommended! And this from a non PVP player!!",Recommended
Do you like DayZ with actually guns laying around parachutes and no need for food but a wanton lust for murdering the competition? This game's all for you. You get dropped on an island with a bunch of other people who are (usually) screaming memes or mic spamming on a plane which you are designated to drop out of. But don't worry about them for now. You drop out and land onto the island in scavenge for weapons to snuff out the competition! There's a catch though there's a safe zone on the map and it slowly closes on you. Get to the safe zone before the borders close in on you too much and get (usually) destroyed by everyone already waiting for you there. The game wittles down to whatever last team is left alive. Great fun most the time! Just pray you have the eyes of a hawk.,Recommended

This game is insidious you grab it thinking you'll play a few games with a friend every once and awhile. Then it starts taking over you you start thinking of it while playing other games at parties when yoir sleeping you'll dream of it.PUBG not even once.,Recommended
such a good game. Have to buy myself a better pc tho but still worth it D,Recommended
This game is amazing. The gunfights are very satisfying and seem very realistic. All the different attachments and scopes you can put on guns is an aspect many games don't have. The price of 25 is in my opinion a fair ask for a game that you can get so much out of.Edit Recently I have seen many negative reviews for this game do not let these put you off most of them are people complaining about the new 'Battle Pass' which lets you pay to get clothing and skins for your character the more you pay. If you don't want to buy the pass don't buy it but please don't be swayed by these negative reviews from people who are no offense clearly stupid.,Recommended
For a $30 game it's amazing.For a game picked up by multi million dollar companies for branding it's awful.For a game made by a small team over a short period it's riveting.For a game that's made as much money as it has it's atrocious.For a game that is a core Battle Royale it's incredible.For a game that's first code seems written last week it's glitchy.For a game that I have spent so much time on it's addictive.For a game that has wasted so much of people's lives it's shallow.,Recommended
This is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. It is really fun with friends and it gets your heart pumping. I have experienced very little problems with the game and I have played it over 40 hours.,Recommended
Battle Royal at its best but loosing ground to other BR games due to being still unfinished Engine wise and therefore an unsatisfying gaming experience in some scenarios.There is not many better feelings in games than getting that hard fought Chicken Dinner to your name. Getting it denied by yet another kill happening when you are already behind cover for 2 seconds feels terrific on the other hand which leads us to the bad part of PUBG which is still a game with BETA like performance no matter how good your pc runs.,Recommended
I'll probably get **** for this but I honestly don't understand how anyone with over 100hrs of gameplay can give this a negative recommendation. This game is clearly the best in its genere at this time and has an amaizing dev team. Sure they've had issues with hackers glitches etc. but they are constantly addressing the issues and it does not make the game unplayable. Even with all of the bugs if the game were to stay as it is today my opinion would still remain positive toward it. This is honestly the best $30 I've ever spent on a game. Screw all the negativity. If you're looking to buy this game and have a group of friends to play it with you wont regret it. (ok....only once or twice a night),Recommended

You can still find hackers every once in a while and performance could still use some work but overall it's a lot better.,Recommended
The game is pretty good but they really have to work better on how they implement their updates. In one update performance and stabillity is improved and maybe 2 updates later people start getting ramdom crashes again until next patch...... that is a really big issue.,Recommended

Product received for free. If you have a really good pc and don't mind playing in third person this game is amazing. However if you're like me and have to play fps get ready to be dissapointed. For whatever reason first person perspective or FPP has crippling lag the first few minutes of the game. You can't pick up loot consistantly you don't get good hit registration and you die six feet around corners. This does MOSTLY go away after the early game but you are still slapped in the face with audio imbalance like the deafening buggy deafening plane deafening rain and deafening ear in spawn island. Luckily they give you hotkeys to mute your game but do you really want to have to mute your game when you're driving through the middle of a field during third to last circle? I think not. The game also has chonic bugs not 420 chronic but bugs they can't seem to or don't care to squash. Like not being able to drop a quickdraw mag when you're inventory is full a bug I've encountered since release or car collision mechanics. Despite all this despite Kar 98 bullets going through people despite the joke of a home screen and the awful UI despite the terrible lack of optimization I would still have to recommend this game. It is amazing.,Recommended

Product received for free. This game is AWESOME!! The premise of the game is nothing new but this game manages to introduce some new features that make it play better than H1Z1 Rust and all of those other games combined. Matches don't last too long so you don't get invested enough to make you rage. I have never run into any cheaters whatsoever in this game. If you're looking for a fun pvp shooter with semi realistic combat then this is the game for you. Amazingly fun if you have at least one other person to play with as the style of gameplay changes. 11/10 reccommend to anyone looking for a fun shooter.,Recommended

Contrary to what I heard before purchasing the game there aren't many glitches. I haven't encountered any glitches yet. The machmaking system is relatively fast. This game is definetely way more fun when playing with friends though. Teaming up with friends make it all around better than playing alone or with randoms. So far hackers have been the only problem I have encountered. With only five hours locked in I have already player against hackers. Despite this being frustrating the game does have developers trying to fix this issue. Would definetlely reccomend if you have a squad or friend to team up with. Having one or three friends is optimal but having two can work also.,Recommended
Best last man standing shooter ever. Definetely worth to buy!Also the servers are running fine and it's not lagging.,Recommended
Need more optimization,Recommended
Good game I spend hours with my friends I love this game in special because is DACIA and I'm from Romania PCR POWER )),Recommended

I hate this game.. I've died in countless stupid ways. I've died before hitting the ground I've died with only one other person left.. I've died from flipping a bike and I've died from a mate whacking me in the head with a pan from the back seat of the car.. But for some reason it keeps me playing so it must be a good game.100/100 will die again..,Recommended
This is one of the funnest games i have ever played. Do not let all the bad reviews discourage you. Unless you have a bad pc then let this discourage you.,Recommended
this game is pretty gooduse reshade,Recommended
Product received for free. it is a good game if you have a very powerful computer and good internet. unless u wlll find lags all over the game.,Recommended
IT'S NOT THAT I RECOMMEND THIS 100%It's just because this game doesn't really have good alternative (aside from Fortnite). As for the gameplay you already know the gameplay from Youtube / Twitch. I play in SEA/Oceania server and this is what i foundBe wary of Sudden DC (server side rarely tho) Hacker (even if you found it rarely it still exist) FPS dropsOh and squeakers. There're too many players that don't talk english. Don't expect playing in random squad while using comms effectively. They talk trash earraping etcConclussion Solo? Expect things above Squad? Play it with friends. Period.,Recommended
I really really really didn't want to buy PUBG in fact I held out for months despite people hassling me to get it.... but I caved and got it and I have to say it is a lot of fun.BUTThe only reason I caved was the progress being made on getting rid of the cheaters. I don't generally call out hax just because I died I am am utter at shooters and no game can have a hacker for each time I die but you kinda know when it's happening right.... that dude headshotting you and the rest of your squad each time even one of you peeks from a different location..... that dude that hits headshots with an AKM on burst at 300m... 4 of them... while yr on a speeding bike.Still having a lot of fun though in the clean matches and looking forward to fewer hackers soon.Would I recommend the game.... well the tension and pace are fantastic and playing with friends is a lot of fun but if you are easily off by the times you meet a cheater wait a little while longer until it's fixed a bit more.,Recommended
fun and wait for no hacker in game,Recommended
When this game works its great.,Recommended

As a Chinese I know that cheating is prevalent in my country. I hope that blue hole will learn how to fight against cheating in Tencent. After all Tencent is still the top class in the world. We hope that the blue hole will be the same. After all most Chinese players are positive.,Recommended

The 1.0 update brought a lot of stability and needed changes to the game along with a new map. This game is finally at a point where I can recommend it for $30. If you're looking for a slow paced game that you can play with friends you will probably enjoy this title.,Recommended
good game,Recommended
A nice game but a lot of cheaters!,Recommended

I think it's absolutly worth to buy!I played battleroyale since Arma 2 and I love this iconic gamemode. This game is not perfect yet but it's far good enough to spend a lot of fun hours with yo friends and make some badass actions. My personal opinion so positiv about game developers works and future plans. They try to make this game better and better. They add lot of new features like UI new maps weapons &amp vehicles.I'm strongly recommend this game!My future plans with this game is spend more hours with this and try to do some e sport with it. EU SERVERS ARE LAGGY AF,Recommended

Engaging gameplay structured very well around quick but intense single objective survive. People mention cheaters but I don't see it and honestly the game is not worth getting bent out of shape over. If I die I just jump into another game it's more about the fun not the win and that's very important in a game that many games lack these days. There's no long term goal or character development your involvement is only required until you die and you can jump back in or call it quits for the day. In the end I feel happy to have played and not all bent out of shape like other games can leave you.,Recommended
Fun,Recommended

However England fare in the final Ashes test the 2009 battle has done a fantastic job of dragging Cricket back into the public imagination and that represents a golden opportunity for Codemasters. For around 15 years on and off the company has been pushing out cricket games under the Brian Lara banner fending off the occasional challenge from EA and enjoying a modest level of success. If ever there was a time for a cricket video game to hit the big time it's now but it won't be easy. As even EA has found it's one thing making a sports game that can appeal to that sport's hardcore fanbase and quite another to make one that will appeal to a wider audience. Now that audience might be ready for The Ashes 2009. The question is whether The Ashes 2009 ready for it?,Recommended

The beauty is in the simplicity.This game is genuinely fun. You control the pacing from the second you leave the plane. Jump into a low risk low reward zone and spend 20 minutes looting in peace...or jump into a hot spot and spend every second fighting for your life reaping huge loot if you survive. The shooting just feels good. WIth recent performance increases it look beautiful and runs well. Loot and fight loot and fight. Simple fun.I fear that the more they add to this game the less fun it will be. The recent talks of an ELO system ranks and rewards...I think it will draw away from what makes this game so appealing...the simplicity...loot...fight....loot...fight. I realize I may be in the minority. But time will tell I guess. Watch them feature this game into the norm of today's gaming standards...or leave it in it's beautiful simplicity. Definitely pick it up now though. Before you have to micro transaction your way to a favorable drop zone.,Recommended

This game is incredibly fun with a high rate of replayability.At first you' ll die a lot but once you get better you'll realize getting in the top 10 isn' t as hard as it looks. After this you'll still need to play a lot of hours before you'll get your first win but trust me it's worth it.,Recommended
This is one of the most fun game I have played ALL YEAR!!!I cant wait for it to come out TODAY!!!!!!If you are thinking about buying this game DO IT!!!!! It is 100% worth every penny!!!Hope this helped!!!,Recommended
I love getting ed from behind,Recommended
Thoughts before release.One of the best survival game.First really bad optimization if you don't own a medium or high end pc don't even try. You don't need an incredible cpu but you'll need at least an 1050 ti to play at a good framerate.Second the game is buggy but that's why it's sometimes funThird personally i had a lot more fun playing with friends at least more then playing alone so if you don't wanna tryhard find a friend and have funAnd last the community of this game is pretty good the developers listen to the public and do things our way updates came through pretty fast but we'll see after launch if developers keep their promises.Overall in my opinion it deserves an 8/10,Recommended
Stopped playing for awhile. Got back on after 1.0 update. No lag No server crashing No render problems No bugsI really don't honestly see what's going on with everyone. It's a real improvement from how it used to be. I'd buy it again if I could.,Recommended
Waited 9 months for the 1.0 release of this game and all I got was this lousy t shirt!,Recommended
as of right now i would not recommend this game to anyone. It's way to buggy and unoptimized to play it properly unless you have an insane gaming rig. I already have a decent computer and the game is way to laggy on fast mouse movements to aim. In maybe a year or hopefully even less time when the game wont give you random errors and will run more smoothly i would 100% recommend it as it is a lot of fun for me and alot of my friends.,Recommended
Still needs to be optomized and balanced but really fun game to play with friends.,Recommended
NICE!,Recommended
Yes this is an Early Access Game and would expect loads of things that are not up to scratch yet but this game is great for players who want to show off a bit of their survival and their awareness skill with their friends. It's a great game when this is out of Early Access and I hope this game improves on their fanbase to collect information that is good or bad in the game.,Recommended

The game is slowly getting better and better so right now might be the time to buy it if you have a proper pc that can handle the game but if not then dont purchase the game yet because it still needs more optimization for lower end pc's and server stability issues to fix,Recommended

I must agree that this game had alot of laggs and bugs but once they got fixed I wouldn't say that this game is not a good one. Also it's a early access so don't expect much smoothness!,Recommended
PUBG is a full example of how the gaming industry's standards are dropping. Releasing a game that crashes frequently has numerous bugs that effect gameplay and plenty of other annoying things like gun spawns that seem to be random thus creating games where you drop in loot 3 7 house only to find a pistol. This game should be in early access not a full release.Despite all its drawbacks i do still recommend getting it as it is a fun game to play solo or with friends just note that you will experience frequent bugs and crashes that will make you think this is an early access game.,Recommended
At first I didn't like this game and was going to get a refund...Now I wish I had taken the refund. I die and die from little kids hidding in toilets or hiding behind rocks. They only use the double barrel shotgun and I get killed 1 hit. Armour on the game is pointless as wearing a plastic bag over your head and torso they literally do NOTHING. In addition to all this bullcrap the framrate on that game is worse than me trying to play witcher 3 with my potato computer they really need to fix that All in all it's sorta grown on me and I have come to enjoy the game somewhat. I rate 8/8 Dean,Recommended

Personally I like the game. I recommend it to others especially to group of friends. It s a good game tho it may have some bugs and glitches but it is still an alpha (or beta) game so I won t mind (yet). I recommend not playing it TOO seriously and just have fun with it because you ll only yourself. It s more fun playing with friends but It s better to play it solo first to learn it first hand.,Recommended

Great concept.Poor excecution.Loads of hackers.Would recommend.,Recommended
This Game Is Awesome For The guys that are complaining about the bugs in this game just remember that this game is still in Beta version so shut up and report the bugs.,Recommended
The game is still pretty much broken but it s catchy and of all battle grounds games the most realistic so far. If you have a group of friends to play with give it a try.,Recommended
This game is fun but if you're new to battle royale then you'll get killed aloooot without killing anyone which is not fun at first but its addicting. I havent had any hackers in my game surprisingly but I do have to warn you this game is really graphics demanding. I'm running a GTX 1080 paired with an old i7 4770 (non k) played at eveything to the lowest at 4k but i cant get a smooth 60fps unlike every other games especially the early games but i think that has to do with the servers instead of my computer. 7/10,Recommended

Brilliant basis and everything but some things are a biy broken though it's an early access game it should be fixed really. First of all the the punches the basic punch while standing or moving is just small damage as it should be but then a jump punch is like a falcon punch instantly killing the opposing player this needs to be sorted to make it do a bit more damage but not insta kill. Either way the game is decent some things are buggy like the server connection and so and so forth.But this game itself can be easily improved upon like campaign and stuff which was spoken of in announcements and updates.,Recommended
Other than the constant annoying asian hogging up NA servers if you got some buddys it's pretty time consuming fun P,Recommended

The most balanced and well made Battle Royale game out there. No Surprise coming from PU )From the movement to the gunplay to the UI it's all very well done and simple to use. Coming from a survival player's viewmpoint playing games like like arma 2 arma 3 dayz/SA H1Z1 etc. This is the most polished and well thought out game i've played in a long time and it's rapidly turned into one of my favorite games. I fully place my faith in PU and the team behind this game They've already showcased their ability to fix different bugs and problems so i hope and trust that its not going to be like the dayz SA dev. If you love the Battle Royale genre support the best experience you can have and buy the game.You won't regret it Solid 5/7,Recommended
Wasn't a huge fan of the genre but I had a few friends that played. I found the game pretty frustrating playing solo but actually quite fun playing in a squad.,Recommended
"This game is very much based on luck. I note some have the reflexes of a cat and eye sight of a hawk but for mere mortals luck is all you have. Some games you die early because you are unlucky to land near someone who finds a gun before you can. Other games you can be in the last 10 because you managed to stay out of sight. Very rarely you might manage to shoot someone before they shoot you but it often comes down to what weapons and armour you each managed to find before happening across each other. When you do well you think you're improving until the next game proves how unlucky it can be. I've played so much now that I know ""improving"" is an illusion.So while I say the game is largely luck it's still definitely fun.I also feel this is what war would be like those who get to come home are mostly lucky. With so many people shooting each other winners can rarely boast their victory is because of how clever they were.I have to play this game without headphones. And that puts me at a serious disadvantage as I can't tell where shots are coming from I have to be Mr Hidey! Why no headphones? Because the intense atmosphere in the game makes me literally jump when all is quiet I'm creeping around and a shot rings out nearby plus my character gives a startled grunt when hit! This upsets my wifey who is calmy sitting next to me reading because she jumps too since I jumped!The reason I play this game so much is it's the first game I worked out how to earn money from. You earn Battle Points by playing the longer you survive the more points you get per game. Then you can buy loot crates with the points and then sell them on the Steam market for real money. While a smart person would save this money to buy games I'm blowing it all on Trading Cards! And not because I care about Trading Cards but because when you get a full set of Trasing Cards you can craft a Badge. And each Badge you create helps you level up in Steam. Why? I'm a closet RPG fiend who likes levelling? I just like big numbers? Who knows!",Recommended
How can I go about reviewing this game... On one hand it's a buggy unpolished mess that can be more frustrating than fun and can lead you to dying more times than you deserve. On the other hand sometimes it's the best experience I've had with a game for quite some time. I recommend this game on the hopes that the fixes they've promised will fix the big issues the game has with movement and gunplay and also lag and hitboxes. I'd honestly recommend waiting the few months for the game to be released before picking it up.,Recommended
This game is much better then h1z1,Recommended
I never imagined that playing a game where I run around for 30 minutes looting empty houses for weapons and frying pans trying to be as stealthy as possible in a gigantic map while running away from a constricting circle of death and ending up getting killed before I even fire a single shot could be this fun.9.5/10,Recommended

Great game for the price! So far for me with 16GB RAM GTX 970 I 7 5960k and SSD runs with no issues whatsoever. This game gives you all the blood pumping action that you get from H1Z1 every 15 30 min the entire game since it gradually makes all players head to a certain area on the map so very rarly do you have to leave the action unless you want to. You can mod weapons and from what I can see there is no pay to win just cosmetics. Very fast past no waiting just play till you die or win and the jump right into another game.Im addicted..! 9/10 so far...,Recommended

Pleasantly surprised the game only averages about 60 fps but thats fine. The gameplay is just ing great i love how their are 2 different maps. Unlike fortnite PLAYERUKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS was definitely worth my 20 Pound.,Recommended
This game was fun if you have somone to play with it hurts to see that the devs are making mistakes on vans but they are only human. The amount of hate this game is getting is undeserved and wrong because it is truly a fun experience. If you don t know about the drama some streamer claimed taht he was getting killed by this kid who was using an un fair advantage by looking at his stream and the devs banned him and he s guilty till proven innocent and this is happening a lot as long as you don t f with people you should be fine and have fun like I said devs are humans to and I know they will right their wrongs,Recommended

For every day that passes my distaste for Fortnite grows. Not only because they ripped off some aspects of PUBG. But EPICGAMES have done some really shi tty things in the past. Back in October or November they sued a 14 year old for hacking. Now everybody hates PUBG for suing copycats? Come on. Gameplay wise this game is fantastic. With smooth shooting and satisfying kills. You could call this game a walking simulator but then you would be wrong. The game focuses on strategy and planning. The only issue i have with this game is that the optimization is bad. Other than that this game is everything I want from a battle royale game. 9/10,Recommended

The game has its fair share of bugs but even then it is still one of the most fun and exciting multiplayer games when the action gets going. Never fails to get my heart racing in a top 10 situation.,Recommended
This is the most difficult recommend I've given.On one hand the game has it's fair share of problems. Vehicles bug out and kill your squad people shoot you from behind walls textures don't load sometimes the game is rampant with hackers the devs have a penchant for being greedy.On the other hand it's still so much fun and there's no other Battle Royale experience like it especially with friends.I've tried plenty of Battle Royale games H1Z1 Totally Accurate Battlegrounds Fortnite but none of them hit the feeling PUBG gives me. The bad stuff nearly doesn't bother me as much as you'd think when it boils down to it. The game doesn't require additional purchases to play (not that I'm advocating a cosmetic only system in a game that costs $40 already) the textures not loading and people shooting through walls happens maybe once in 20 matches for me and you can use the buggy vehicles for some pretty dumb things.There's the feeling you get when you win as well. Maybe I just get it because I don't win a lot but it's still refreshing and exhilarating when you kill the last person and you can ride that high for the rest of the play session with your friends.That's the other point this game is WAY more fun with friends especially good friends. Finding all the attachments to tweak a gun to your preference moving through the map as a group calling out flanks and positions it's a nice feel to it.This game won't be for everyone. Some people can't look past the bad and it's fine. Some people are more suited for the faster playstyles of Fortnite or H1Z1 and that's fine but for me PUBG is great.,Recommended

I don't play FPS not my favorite genre and I have only played Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch casually. This game hooked me like no other before. I was glued to it the rush of adrenaline and thrill of almost beating it is incredible (my best position so far is a #2 so no chicken dinner for me yet).I was completely surprised by it and I pretend to keep playing it.,Recommended
This game needs more birds.,Recommended
nice game more than my life,Recommended
I normally dont like shooters probabliy because I suck at them. But PUBG fascinated me from minute one even though the start was quite frustrating with a lot of deaths in the first minute. But the first chicken dinner surely felt awesome,Recommended
Cosmetics do not apply to PAID content. Holy you cry babies does having a 400 dollar skirt give a player an advantage? No. Paid content would be like not able to access a weapon or a map that inhibits the player from playing without playing. No one is forcing you to buy loot crates and it doesn't stop you from playing the same game as everyone else. Now go play the game sell the boxes and make some money.,Recommended

This game is such a great game but there's some issues with bugs but every game have bugs. So im here to talk about HACKERS/CHEATERS. *FULL RAGE MODE ACTIVATED* THIS GAME IS FULL OF ASIAN HACKERS THEY'RE EVERYWHERE! U CAN'T AVOID THEM THIS GAME SHOULD BLOCK CHINESE PLAYERS FROM PLAYING ON OTHER SERVERS BESIDE ASIAN SERVERS FFS THIS GAME IS RUINED BY CHINESES OR THEY SUCK OR THEY TEAMKILL OR THEY ARE HACKING! but there's the chineses that actually enjoy the game and get punished by fault of others. *BACK ON RAGE MODE* I DIDN'T CAME ACROSS WITH A SINGLE CHINESE THAT SPOKE ENGLISH OR WAS GOOD THIS GAME IS LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE WITH CHINESE PEOPLE! (sorry for those chineses that actually try to play the game and DON'T HACK/CHEAT u're a great person) That was what i had to say thanks and STOP HACKING AND LEARN THE GAME U A$$HOLE!,Recommended

After 500+ hours of PUBG I can make a decent review of the game. The graphics are great the game can play at a solid 60fps or 144fps if you have a decent rig. The gameplay can vary between the three maps that are already out the Sanok the fast paced map and the original two maps that play very slow. The new map that just came out at the time of this review. Gun mechanics and movement are decently balanced and solid. Overall this has the potential to be a great game. The biggest problem with Player Unknown's BattleGrounds is the terrible server quality and the poorly optimized fps issues that come with the game. For me at least the game has grown stale because of the lack of content and the lack of support by the developers to continually optimize the game. The game is fun but it can be very difficult to continually enjoy because of these small things. I personally have stopped playing because there isn't much to enjoy once you have explored the whole map. Chicken dinners are great but you can only stomach before it makes you sick and never want to comeback. If the developers decide to improve their game I will be open to returning. For now I'm sticking to more enjoyable titles.,Recommended
Review (or update your review) for a game you've nominated!,Recommended
This is a very enjoyable game. Most of the mechanics are straight forward and exactly how you would image them to be in a game like this. Therefore you can jump right in and start having fun without too much of a learning curve. The game is extremely tactical and a small decision at the beginning of your match could mean death later on. This game thrives when playing in a squad with your friends.Update patches are regular (usually once a week) with hot fixes being deployed right away when needed. I look forward to following this game as it develops.,Recommended
Highly addictive competitive game.Only problems are with optimisation and servers. Otherwise great game!,Recommended

Alright boys. Let me just sum this up for ya. You land at School. You shoot up everybody there. Then get a vehicle and drive to the circle. Just to die to some random chinese hacker that just yells NI HAO NI HAO.Then go into another game and try it again. But this time stay away from school. But little do you know. Chinese hackers are everywhere. Then you die. All i can say is try your best and heres a little tip from a pro. Always land at Hacienda Del Patron. Also it is illegal to shoot up schools. So refrain from landing at school please. Ty. Have a nice day.Love Cpt. Chung Li Wun,Recommended

Playerunknown s Battlegrounds is a new entry in the still young battle royale genre. Offered by Bluehole a new South Korean company PUBG feels like the first real battle royale game to come on the market.Airdropped onto the soviet island of Erengal you and 99 other players must fight to the death until only one of you is left all while a circle closes in herding the survivors closer together and killing those who refuse to follow its path.After landing at a location you chose you must gather any weapons ammo healing and utilities that you can find. If you don t you ll be left without a weapon and a free kill for other players. Armed with whatever you could find you must either find a spot to hide at or find a vehicle to get inside the circle. The circle is a force field that gets smaller as the game progresses. If you fail to get inside the circle your health will slowly chip away until you either get inside the circle or die trying. If you fail to get inside the circle your health will slowly chip away until you either get inside the circle or die trying. You are then forced to either kill or be killed. Encounters are fast and frantic especially in the late game. Without good armour you ll die in one stray headshot. If you survive to the last 10 players you focus on survival in the hopes of being the final victor.The game can be played solo in duos or in squads of 3 or 4 allowing for playing with friends. This leads to memorable moments as you get great shots or all get shot by one person with a pistol and a frying pan.The game isn t perfect though its early access nature means that the game has many technical issues ranging from crashes and bad performance. Server performance is also poor when compared to other games but this is understandable as the server has to keep track of 100 people at once.Graphics look like any other early access game in the Unreal engine unremarkable but serviceable. The game looks fine on both very low and ultra.Gameplay is great all the way through. Fights are intense and fast and time in between fights are suspenseful.,Recommended

The Righteous Currently the best Battle Royale game around. Decent weapon balance and distribution. The best rounds of PUBG I have played are among the best gaming experiences I have ever had. The Loathesome Can be over in seconds. Server stability remains something of an issue (though finding an online FPS/TPS game where this isnt an issue is a cumbersome task). Fewer things are more irritating than spending 20 minutes running towards an ever shrinking safe zone only to get one shotted by the end The Butterface Cheating cheaters who cheat. Although many online games of this nature suffer from aimbots speed hacks and so on they stand out so much more in PUBG due to the nature of the elimination system I live in hope that this will be dealt with in the the near future. The implementation of the microtransaction random cosmetic item system was also suspect in an early access paid game but its not like it makes it pay2win. All in all. The game is great albeit still a work in progress. A lot of the salty negative reviews are coming from a place of frustration. Frrustration that wouldn't exist if people didn't think this was a great game.,Recommended
Product received for free. Thanks to PUBG I was able to learn and understand Chinese. No game has ever gone above and beyond to ensure that I learn another language and culture like PUBG has accomplished. All jokes aside the game is alright. Definitely a fun game to play with friends.,Recommended
This game has blown me away. It's ridiculously fun and cleverly put together. Yes its an early access and there are bugs byt the devs are fixing bugs pretty quickly. Honestly I've seen triple A's released from mega studios in worse states,Recommended

All these negative reviews are posted from fortnite kids. There is nothing that bad in the game .,Recommended
The game is pretty nice in spite of some bugs which aren't as big as addressed of some guys. However Bluehole is going to fix them and they know that their game have some issues. They admited their mistakes and work with the community much better than before. The game experience is great. During the entire match you have to be alert otherwise youw will be killed from behind. It is full of tension! The price is also acceptable for the opportunities you get.Summing up the game is good apart from some issues which are resolved fastly.,Recommended

Okay so i've only played this for approx 8 hours and i must say i've never been so hooked on a game before it's fun to play solo and the weapon spawns seems balanced and so does the damage. The map is perfect size if you like arma 3 you will love this because it's built on the same Engine. Though i must admit that the textures seem very off sometimes and it's sometimes too much ''popping'' in the rendering. But overall if you play with a friend this game becomes the best game ever.i'll give it 7/10 because the textures and the popping when it renders gets kind of annoying and the fps drops too much atm.My rig is GeForce GTX 980Ti Founders Edition16Gb 1600Mhz Rami7 4790k Z97 gaming 3 motherboardAnd i run the game on ultra with 60+fps with fps drops here and there so there can definatly be some better optimization done here.,Recommended
The Game is really good. I've never tried H1Z1 before so I don't know if it's better. But I know it's very fun. The only bad thing for me is that i have to make every thing on medium and the viewing on high or it will lag. But thats on me. Love playing this game with friends and have a good time killing people. I get so hyped. Hope this is what you are looking for in a review comment,Recommended
Its a realy good game. It doesnt matter if u play solo or in an group its always fun,Recommended
pree gud,Recommended
Fun exhilarating and addictive. It gets incredibly tense later in the game and when im in the last ten alive after the game I'll find myself shaking. And nothing gets me as a excited as finding a rare weapon or attachment on the map during the game. The developer Bluehole has been doing early access well so far by fixing glitches and net code issues and adding new content into the game for free not any of the ark survival t. Generally a great and enjoyable game (Although a bit frustrating apon death but hey thats just how the game works people have to die.) Absoloutley reccomend buying although you should wait a bit if your pc isnt the best because the game's optimisation isn't completely 'there' yet.,Recommended
Great game if you have a good GPU,Recommended
Now mentally challenged PCs can enjoy this game as well.,Recommended
"After Almost 100hours And 3 Solo Wins...This game will you off its that simple. Buy yet after every annoying death or almost wins i keep playing.After every match my heart is usually pumping. Which is a very addicting feeling. No matter what when you drop in with a 100 other people to fight it out. No matter who you are you have a chance. A tiny little sliver of a chance to win. Knowing that the games incredibly fun. Some Advice For New Players Luck Is a big part of it. Dropping in and finding good gear quickly and arming yourself with the best weapons as fast as possible is the ""Meta"" of this game. Inventory management and quickly tabbing in and out and using drag and drop to pick up weapons and gear is CRUCIAL. The Faster you do this the longer you will surivive. It takes time but youll get good at it I will say this is a game of choosing your battles planning out a strategy and being able to adjust to what the game throws at you. If you can overcome all those things and add a little proper marksmenship and i gurantee youll get a win. In terms of any negatives It's Early Access Theres gunna be server issues glitches alot of things that still need to be ironed out. But nothing game breaking. (Just expect it to happen) The Bullet Drop seems a little extreme to me. To hit a moving target 200 300 meters away you have to aim almost 5 feet in front of your target. When i feel like in most games and realisticly aiming for the bodys leading edge would do the trick. Now Ive played almost every battlefield ARMA 2 &amp 3. Im quite familair with extreme and realistic bullet drop in games. Honestly getting used to the bullet drop is what drew me away from the game about 27ish hours in. I just couldent hit anybody at range. Then finally it clicked. It took me quite awhile to get used to the gun play and finallly now around 80 hours in i can almost gaurantee ill make it to the top 5 at least. So at least for me i had a steep learning curve. In Conclusion In the end i feel like PUBG is a solid shooter once you learn its quirks and get used to the gunplay. I can easily say ive had more tense moments and smiles per hour playing this than any other game in years.",Recommended
This game is one of my favorites. I will say there is a lot of love hate with this game though. Its great to kill time with friends but after a while you have to start giving yourself challenges to keep it interesting otherwise it just gets old. Highly recommend this game to anyone who doesn't easily get angered by videogames.,Recommended
It's a great game. Grab 3 friends and enjoy the rollercoaster ride that is PUBG.,Recommended
This game is extremely difficult but extremely fun. If you haven't payed a battle royale style of game this would be my number 1 reccomendation. The game is stil early in development so there is still some desync and the game suffers from a few minor lag issues (mostly near the beginning of matches which are also intermittent and short lived). That aside Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a welcome addition to the FPS / 3rd person FPS genre. I haven't outlived the games fun factor even after 455 hours of game time. Bluehole's development team seems very dedicated and have been pumping out significant updates since the alpha launch. Two thumbs up!,Recommended
Ok here is my thoughts after a couple days playtime. This game is a darn amazing accomplishment. They managed to take most of what we loved from the day z mod and boil it down to its base roots. Nemely a no holds barred kill fest. Kill on sight. Kill as fast as you can. And do anything you can NOT toi get killed!. Huge map...check. About 100 p layers...check. Realistic feeling weapons and vehicles...check. I can't speak really for rampant cheatring because I don't get to hung up on trying to find out who is cheating and who isn't. However I can say that out of the many times I have been killed it certainly looks and feels like every death was legit. In my opinion this is one of the best games I have played to date. And can see why it has become a bit of a phenomenon.,Recommended

This game is actually amazing the Devs fix problems with the game and literally everything I can think about it is good. There were a few glaring issues I posted about in my first review but these problems were fixed within a matter of weeks which is really fast if you ask me. AAA games like For Honor can't even get their straight this fast and Ubisoft has more people. I'm really pleased with how the developers work with this game they actually care about it and it isn't some 60$ money grab. They looked at their game and put it up for a value that's fair. And on top of that the game is fun and you don't have to buy airdrops and like that. I really hope to see this game grow and I have high expectations for that the developers do with this game.,Recommended
Product received for free. Game is good but it's not optimized,Recommended
Really fun concept and a good game at it's core. The developers just really need to focus up and finish the full release of the game. My biggest complaint is they have sold over 10 million copies at $30 each and they are starting to develop a new game without finishing this one first.Would still recommend as a good game to play with friends,Recommended

It's a cross between call of duty and H1Z1 King of the Kill Call of duty I mention due to the wide array of guns addons equipment and mechanics.H1Z1 King of the kill I mention due to PUBG being based off KOTK and improving upon various aspects.Overall the game still needs some work but for an early access it recieves no less than a 10/10. Mechanics are superb choice of weapons great virtually bugless smooth interface.,Recommended

I got this game on Christmas and still I've learned a lot. I've learned more things than you can imagine a person like me could understand. Not first off I'm not gonna be another one of those butt hurt people complaining about chinese hackers. On one of the recent updates they added region lock. Not all the way tho. It's more of a ping lock so chinese people with sky high ping probably can't join the same server as you. I haven't come across a signle chinese hacker at all since the update. Definitly recommend this game but seriously... the cosmetic prices are WAYYYYYYY to expensive either that or add a TON more cosmetics. And for the love of God DON'T MAKE GUN SKINS!

This game absolutely keeps you on the edge of your seat with changing tactics terrain and teammates every single round whether that is tackling teammates (e.g. that have no mic whatsoever) that run off and die or the last few rounds where you squeeze the top 3 10 together the adrenaline pump is real as there is no predictability over your chances of winning.I don't think I've had this much fun in such a while. Yes the game is in alpha and it does come with its annoyances (e.g. shooting people x10 times). With that said I think this is a great start and I believe the devs are in a good position to deliver a polished product when the time is right.,Recommended

I dont understand negative reviews i only ever encountered one cheater ( what multi game have you not encountered one).

"What I don't like is ineffective action by the developers. Regular updates about how many thousands of accounts banned except that somehow cheaters have monetized the loot in this game so for every account that gets banned another gets purchased AKA a regular income stream for Blue Hole. I will continue to play but in First Person only and that does separate me from some of my regular team mates. Blue Hole knows what needs to be done and they have been told LOUD AND CLEAR Region Lock China and prevent high pings from playing. I will continue to play until FPP gets infected with cheaters and then I will hang up my headset on this game for good. I cannot however recommend this game in third person at all. People who can shoot me around corners due to ping People who form a team of 8 in solos and proceed to gang bang anyone else People who can instantly lock on to me and shoot the wall im behind with no recoil People who can shoot through the wall im behind People who can shoot directly at the ground 4 km away from where I am and kill me People who can fire a Shotgun like an Assault rifle despite not having a AR equiped Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping. theres No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago but now you're racist or ""xenophobic"" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.And if you say none of these people listed above were chinese. Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.Region Lock China Actually set anti cheat to hardware and shadow ban cheaters (IP MAC address etc.). I know there are ways around it but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game. Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.ability needs added to increase what spectrum can be heard easier which specificlly should be footsteps considering the footstep is buuged sometimes you head them clearly and other times its nonexistant.for my last comment if the entire devoloper team and its ascoiates giveup on further improveing the pubg game they should sign the rights over to a group who would provide more improvements to the game to better its enviroment or atleast lease over the rights so that another group can do so without limitiations by the original owner of said rights. so they can the group can or group of individuals can simply work on bettering the anti cheat fixing repairing bugs adding more details to games registry along with the important thing ping / ms locking out high values such has excessive values of 160ms/ping and region locking /forceing th evast majority of cheaters to thier own servers thus not allowing them to access any server execpt for the specific region. battleye has announced that china is the mainstream of output that cheats and the users of cheats creators of cheats originate from which should be handled with extreme prejudice. ""(definition of extreme prejudice Play on the term terminate with prejudice when an employee's employment is terminated meaning will not rehire employee to same position in future (i.e. prejudiced against rehiring) hence terminate definitively)"" and for any outside of my specific country you have no say in the mater i have announced considering i have my freedom of speech .

Game is indeed still badly optimized (sometimes frames lower than 60 with a 1080 at 1080p)and most settings at very low except AA and some other key settings.Sure the bans for tking and stream sniping should be followed up better.How the game will turn out I don't know.But i do know that the game is fun as hell if you're not into game with too much action.like battlefield 1 or cod.Only negative side so far is the blurred out look of the base game.With a program like reshade it already looks 10 times better with minimal performance loss.Comparison https //youtu.be/nC03IYCamDEOther than that play the game for fun.Stop playing games to look for problems ...Mail them Twitter them idc Feedback is important but theres just soo much complaining on steam .

Lots of fun and lots more fun to come!,Recommended
Overall I definitely recommend this game. It is fun to play alone or with friends it always gets the adrenaline pumping and no two games are the same.Definitely has its fair share of bugs as well as a lot of Chinese hackers but for me I don't run into them too often so it doesn't detract from my experience too much. Biggest gripe is lack of maps. Only having 2 can get dull after playing the game for a while.,Recommended

Good game ),Recommended
After spending over 100 hours in this game (across multiple accounts) I can say that as long as you trial the game you will either love it or hate it. For me I got hooked instantly and whether or not you will feel the same way after 50 hours doesn't matter too much. For me a good price playtime is $1 1 hour. as long as you can justify that it's a great addition.,Recommended
This game is good.Ä° like it,Recommended
"Haven't played this game for too long but I will say that this is much more fun for me than Fortnite. I can also see why people compair this game to fortnite because it's literally the same thing but Fortnite has that stupid ""bloom"" thing that I don't like at all building (obviously) shields (which were added to the game later on) and breakable buildings. You could say that Fortnite is more of an arcade game where you will get rushed almost all the time by good players where as PUBG it is a bit more strategic and good placement along with the occasional rush by players that like to play aggresive and not passive. I am not sure how it is for duos and squads but I am still trying to learn the game at the moment and I don't find myself being frustrated as much in this game.I do recommened this game if you like a battle royal (BR) strategy game and if you're coming from fortnite you should play almost the same way when playing this game but probably a bit more passive when you're just starting out. I also hope the developers put out a majour update within the next few months or hopefully this month to tweek some of the glitches and fix a few things... Like the parachute for example I don't really like how it acts when you're landing and is a little confusing which shouldn't really be the case unless they're going for realism then I guess it's ok but I don't really know how a parachute reacts in real life so I can't judge that.I would like to point out one more thing when I started playing I liked to watch the death cam and I thought someone was aim boting players (along with me) but when i watched the full replay he wasn't. He was able to see people more easily than I could and slowing down the replay helped me see that beacuse he didn't notice them right away (if that makes sense) Anyway what i am trying to say is... Don't rely on the death cam alone when reporting someone look at the full game replay as well but they are not really relyable at this point since they also have their glitches and bugs too.",Recommended
Super fun but sometime pvp out of controll lol,Recommended

WARNING Do not play if you tend to throw things.Here is the lowdownPros+Easy and fast to drop into a match+Large variety of weapons/attachments and cosmetic items+Large variety of terrain+Mechanics/gunplay are on point and are still being improved+Ability to Mute voice chat+Graphics are decent+Chicken dinners are hugely satisfyingCons Server lag can and will kill you on occassion Hackers can and will kill you on occassion Circle can and will kill you on occassion One map ATM with one more on the way (I understand these are not easy to create) Sounds for vehicles is elementry Lack of training/target range mode you can run soloPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS Manages to excite and infuriate me almost simultaniously. On one hand you may get amazing luck with drops and be kitted out just to die from someone hiding behind a corner with a shotgun. On the other hand you can be super unlucky and get almost no drops but then be that guy with the shotgun and thus by proxy be the first guy.Its a game I love to hate and after over 160hrs into it I feel I can leave a more than valid score. Amazing so far but with so much more it can accomplish PUBG scores a 8/10,Recommended

this game wack sometimes but im w it,Recommended
Ok so basically I've played enough matches to know what's going on.Bit of a learning curve for the survival shooter battle arena newbie but if you drop high pop first 20 games you'll get the hang of it faster because you're going to have to down a crapton of peeps.You CAN make top 10 easily if you plan ahead and move stealthily. I've found that if you run around guns blazing you get downed hella fast. It's also possible to reach Top 10 without getting kills but it's kind of difficult.Solid time if you play with friends also enemy death voice is hilarious but rare af.As it is now I mean it's not bad but I don't know if it's worth $30 pesos my dude.There are no sales for PUBG as far as I'm aware so if you plan to get PUBG make sure you get the most out of it. I got my fun get yours.Das it later.*Edit*To address other concerns yes there are cheaters.Yes the game is repetitive but if it gets repetitive. Play a different game lmao. You can make the same excuse for any other title.Also I've noticed weird CPU issues with this game specifically my CPU jumps to 100% and sometimes when you join a match you can get stuck on the loading screen but that's not as common as there have been patches.,Recommended
"This game is rly great! It has a nice concept and its just a rly nice game but......i never played a game where u have so many issues with desync / lags / 10tick situations / where u die behind a corner even if u moved 2s earlier behind it and u just die because the enemy player has a different position from u on his screen.It is rly rly rly sad to see what the developers are focussing on the game they implement patches where 15 bugs are fixed but in the same moment there comes 20 new bugs because of the patch. I rly dont know why u need to want to make this game like others games paying crates / keys ( &gt CS GO) emote system ( &gt dayz) and then the focus on to make the game more ""realistic"" this game ISN'T a realistic shooter like EFT. This is a fckin VIDEO GAME not a realistic shooter like ARMA or EFT pls developers pls pls pls forget all these unimportant and unnecessary things. You want to make it rdy for esports?! Then focus the optimization of the graphic / servers / clients &amp network! This is rly important! You dont need to implement things like emotes or idk what it is a SHOOTER. In my opinion if the developers dont switch their focus what to do in the next time this game will die in 6 12 months. This game is rly rly great and u did many things in the last patches but before u implement unnecessery things first fix the IMPORTANT things in this game!",Recommended
This game is way better alternative for h1z1 there is only one thing that is simillar to h1z1 the battle royale game modeH1z1 has been in early acces for 2 years now AND FOR THE ING 2 YEARS DAYBREAK DID NOTHING TO REPAIR THIS GAME.And here comes PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS game developed by creator of first battleroyale mod to arma 3 PLAYERUNKNOWN game that is realistic dynamic with really good shooting system.It has a lot types of weapons and you dont want to stop looting after finding AR helmet and backpack like in h1z1 You have plenty of weapons types of armor and medicines you can use.Only minus is optimalization but it's beeeing fixed with upcoming patches.And remember Daybreak is big departament of sony company and bluehole is a small team which made the game that on release was way better than H1Z1,Recommended

The best Battle Royale game on the planent Most people are going to cry about microtransactions and how they have already paid for a game and why they have to pay again . The answer is simple you dont have to pay again you are still playing the same game as everyone else it is you're choice to purchase skins passes etc ........Rate the game for what it is and dont be giving bad reviews over the fact you dont have money to purchase in game items . Personally I love micro transactions as it gives you the chance to be abit different than the next guy playing but thats my opinion .,Recommended
Best BR in my opinion (if you like realistic BR).I only play FPP and no obvious cheater spotted. Some bug but most of them are fun (cars).You just need a good computer to play the game with a good fps (I got at least 70 max 130).People are mad at this game for almost nothing.,Recommended

great game,Recommended
This game man! OMG! All I can say is that this is everything that you want in a game....Stress paranoia anxiety panic. Seriously though I love it.Just pay attention to the map and the area that you are suppose to be in. Hunker down and listen for footsteps. Be stategic and when you parachute out don't go where everyone else is going. I enjoy this game because I can play at my own pace strategically. I can camp without someone getting So glad that when you die you are unable to watch anyone else play. I have enjoyed everyone that I've encoutered before the game starts. If I had one complaint it would be that you don't get to choose a server. You are put on a server from your country and I'm unware of where it's located but sometimes it can be laggy. Overall one of the best games out at the moment. I can't see this game going anywhere.BUY NOW!!!!,Recommended
Player Unknown's Battlegrounds better known as PUBG is a great game. It is still in its early access stages but by god is it a good game. I have around 100 hours or so on this game and I guess that makes me a normie. Anyways the game is challenging it is rewarding everytime you get a kill get away from someone kill someone then make a big getaway and best of all getting that sweet sweet chicken dinner. PUBG is not a perfect though. There are bugs scattered all around as to be expected from an early access title but sometimes they improve the game even more. All in all PUBG is a frusturating fun stupid awesome game. PS play this game with 3 other friends it will improve your quality of life. AIGHT PEACE,Recommended

Continously Edited Review 25th MarchAlmost Perfect / Almost RefundI mean when you consider as content this game can never be better loot cars boats etc... It's got everything that genre requires.But crashes optimisation wise it's not even close to be perfect. I've got a computer with good specs yet i can crash lots of my friends bought tried and crashed / got low fps etc and had to refund.So if devs keep working just patience but if they don't gg wp... 12th of May That one was from march now it's may and it's a new day.. Just hit one guy 8 times with Scar L and after 8 bullets he turned back killed me with 2. I know that make sense that you can get killed with 2 bullets with a different gun sorry in advance but i don't remember what he had. The thing is lvl 3 armor is ok it's useful etc but this world has 7 347 billion people (2015) who can cry to death with just one of those bullets i mean come on let's be real juuust a hair.. If you are ok with when there are 7 people left the game is already intense and area is so small that you can't even have a second of silence because of gunshots but you have to hit one guy i mean ONE (1) guy more than 8 times to kill i'd say f*ck it that's ridiculous. See u on new update + new edit to review so far f*ck me if i hit that play button again.. 22nd of September Well they're working hard and keep adding more features to the game which was causing some fps drop issues regarding to optimisation but they're keeping it up to date aswell. Still most of the people having issues about fps but it's related to game as well as their pc specs it was much more about the game before.,Recommended

Fun game good graphics Sort of good optimization (amd user) the only time i drop below 60 is in a storm in a city while driving. I run GTX 970 +AMD FX8350. Never goes below 30. Gameplay is good graphics and game mechanics make you drool but the sound makes you have some mental blocks literally the ies sound mechanics I have witnessed in a game. If you play arma H1Z1 csgo basically any game where distant shots are quiet and close shots are loud that isnt the case with this game distant shots are EXTREMELY quiet to the point where I jump when I get hit because i thought the shots were 200+meters away. Otherwise in its current state it is fantastic.,Recommended

This game I've spent enough time to say that I love it. It's got ups and downs in the most extremes. I've noted that nothing for recording or spectating really gives the game the justice it deserves as what this game can be best described as a multiplayer thriller. You have no idea where people are and when you do you hunt them and the adrenaline just pumps. the game's overall feel when in regards to weaponary are actually amazing and brought a real sense of what guns are like. Highly recommend this game. Just remember that being 1st place isn't a reasonable goal and be happy that you've done better than your last round like me I want to get more than 3 kills per round. Then I see how far I can go!,Recommended
Great game over 500 hours when writing this review found hackers won over 60 games if i had to give a rating on this game 8/10 bugs to fix and up the anti cheat but its a great game solo and with freinds.

Best Survival Game i guess! Though you get few bugs and glitches.. Dnt worry Devs are working on it! This game will kick later!,Recommended
This is the most fun I had in a shooter game since back in the CS1.5 days. Solo with friends each round is completely different and interesting. So much adrenaline so much fun. Haven't won a round yet but got really close a few times (just one enemy alive). Winning is even better than nearly winning!+ I haven't personally experienced any cheating in 170 hours.+ Substantial and consistent weekly and monthly updatesWhile I absolutely recommend this game here are my current issues with the game No longer an issue Very laggy at the start of a round (fixes itself in the first 30 seconds after landing) I'm getting 50 to 60 fps on medium now Overall performance is pretty bad I run it at lowest settings (maxium view distance) to get a smooth experience Sound in the lobby breaks down from time to time At least for solo I'd really appreciate more information after I got killed (stats kill cam etc)So if you're unsure maybe wait for a few patches or until it leaves early access. 100% recommend!,Recommended
Excellent game! Great for anyone of all skill levels and playstyles. A good mix of looting and high action that really gets the blood pumping. Winning games are satisfying and losing games are learning experience. No 2 games play the same.Been playing since a few months into early access and the amount of improvements the dev team has made is outstanding. The dev team displays an impressive amount of transparency and communication with the playerbase. They always accept feedback.

This is a great game. it is worth your money. All the salty people in here moaning about microtransactions are forgetting that these are cosmetic not p2w so who gives 2 they would probably moan just as much if they had no customisation or way of getting pretty new things. The devs do need to look at thier banning policy this is the only negative i have. Stream sniping is an issue but i cant see how it is as common as people are saying it is with random servers. There are a few bugs its early access get over it. Compare this to many other early access games and its in a great place considering how long its been out. The game is brilliant and frustrating in a good way my experience so far has only made me want to get better at it.also new map inc soon which is a big plus!All i can sugget is you find out for yourself but be warned you will prbably get dicked on early on until you find your bearings a bit.,Recommended

I've redone this review 3 times over. It's still a positive review as i LOVE pubg. it's great.The big nono now as I can tell is the event pass or monetizing/advertizing the (now defunct) PUBG Initational.I didn't care about the event pass. The challenges that I could do w/o buying them were kinda fun. The skins that I got out of it (now expired) I don't care about.Why complain about a game that has an event pass? CSGO has them all the ing time (in cs time) and nobody reviewbombs it? t.Just buy the game it's good. worth 30 bucks.,Recommended
There are three main game modes in PUBG based on the map you play The basic map You're a Jew hiding from the Nazi fist trying to scrape by through the forests dodging the bullets of the third reich. Weakest of the game modes The desert map You're part of a brigade sent by Jesus Christ with the sole intentions of hunting down the mesicans. The Vietnam map You're a red blooded American soldier deployed in Vietnam with an erection for killing gÎ¿Î¿ks and running over zipperheads.

Don't understand fully why this game gets a lot of hate every time I play this game it's always loads of fun. The intensity of getting a crate in a game is always the same where you just can't wait to use it. Every time there is a battle close quarters the fear factor happens basically every time. After every time you get a win it feels rewarding. All in all it's obviously like H1Z1 but a much better more updated version of it. All in all love it and can't wait for the full game release!,Recommended

Amazing! Just needs Optimization,Recommended
"TL DR This game is amazing if you can run it do yourself a favour and buy it. Yes it has its fair share of rubberbanding and other issues but the game is still addictive and fun. In the beginning you might get into the top 50 or so but you will always return longing the chicken dinner1.0 ReleaseThe full release of the game has brought a new map some UI changes as well as performance improvements. I would say that the game is well optimised now and more players can join the fun.PerformanceI have a GTX 1050ti and an i7 7700HQ on my laptop and I used to frequent around 50 FPS after the 1.0 release I get around 70 FPS indoors and 65 FPS outdoors. I have to commend Bluehole for optimising the game and hearing the cries of this large yet growing community.UIThe overall UI of the game is simple and easy to understand and there is not much to be said here.MapsIn early access PUBG had only 1 map and I admit it felt a bit boring and repetitive playing the same map each game. The new map however is in a desert setting and runs smoothly and offers a great balance when compared to the abandones cityscape and grasslands of the first map.GameplayMy favourite part of the game is it's gameplay. The gameplay is intuitive and the main idea of battle royale is easy to understand for newer players. The game has a large variety of weapons ARs DMRs Sniper Rifles Shotguns and Pistols as well as the legendary pan. Bluehole has done a fantastic job to make this game appeal to competitive and casual players more competitive players may seek the action and challenge one another while more casual players may take the more laid back approach and camp in a room until they need to move. PUBG is also streamer friendly the game is slow paced and offers down time from the action to allow streamers to interact with viewers. Streaming is what introduced me as well as many others to this game.CommunityOverall the communtiy is what helped shape what PUBG is today and most players are nice. Sure You will find some salt shakers and hackers here and there but from an anecdotal standpoint the community is helpful.In Game PurchasesI remember when the Gamescom crate came out and there was an outburst from the community however the game was in Early Access and Bluehole needed more capital to fund R&amp D so that they could release the game to more people.Bluehole has done a good job to keep the game fairly ""Un Pay2Win"" cosmetic items are the only available purchases there are some cosmetic items that may give competitive advantages like the ghillie suit but those items cannot be bought or opened through crates they are found in game.Battlepoints are earned by playing games and killing enemies. Players can buy weekly crates with their 'BP'. This ensures that players are rewarded for their time spent in the game and that all players have a chance to get a skin that they want.Inference/ConclusionThis game has improved alot since Early Access and I recommend that people buy it.I hope this review helped you in deciding whether to buy the game or not you can add me on steam to ask me questions and/or concerns that you have.",Recommended

Player Unknowns Battlegrounds is a game that makes you come back every time. No matter what people say about cheaters and glitches I for one find it extremely satisfying. The rush of constant fighting and the feeling of surviving till the end is what makes it the best game of the year.After leaving Early access the game has actually become better. The game is now smoother and less laggy when compared to pre alpha. There are bugs and glitches that can be found quite easily but it still is a lot of fun to play with friends or go in solo. The problem of cheaters is very troubling in pubg but devs are doing everything they can to eradicate this issue. But being an online game i guess this issue will always exist. Counter strike has this and so does overwatch. But i would definitely recommend pubg for a fun time,Recommended
The Best Game EVER!!!!!!!!!!,Recommended
PUBG is dying,Recommended
"VERY promising game from Battle Royale mastermind PLAYERUNKNOWN (PU). This review will compare battlegrounds (BG) with it's main competition ARMA battle royale (BR) and king of the kill (kotk). Pro's and con's according to me are PRO's fluid beautiful graphics simplified looting fast paced games (around 20 mins as opposed to ARMA BR 30 50 mins) good map size and circle mechanics. CON's Combat feels flimsy especially up close poor weapon sounds (too muffled no ""punch"") too low recoil and lack of audio response when you hit your opponent. As of now too similar to kotk instead of the brilliant BR original. Less arcade please and more hardcore! Remove kill messages fully (make downed players scream / moan) make ""good"" weapons more scarce and WAY LESS AMMO! More weapon sway if injured or fatigued bleeding wounds (light/medium/severe) and other injuries (broken limbs concussions and involuntary screaming when badly hurt... ). Unfortunately the masses dont want that they want easy life and quick fixes mostly.Conclusion A must have for every Last Man Standing fan! Devs seems to patch relentlessly. Get it while it's cheap!!! Roy Batty (the original one!) Gamer since 1979",Recommended
Yes the game has been a mess for a long time now but im glad that they are finally getting around to it with this 3 month plan they have and hopefully by the end of it PUBG will be a great game. Give it time and it will shine,Recommended

was promising but i can sense that microtransactions will soon be taking over the game nothing ruins a good game more than penny pinching developers. money aside this game is a work of art.,Recommended
Much fun. Similar to all of the king of the hill hunger games mashups but better.Jump from plane find loot kill enemy run from blue ring.Lobby's are fast game play can last quite a while if you don't find yourself in a midst of bullets empty handed. When you die you are not stuck waiting until the end of the round just get out and start over. Great game so far! Can't wait for all the updates.,Recommended

I'm honestly not entirely sure what all the negative reviews are for. I've had nothing but fun playing this game! Yes it does suck when you're progressing great and then just get shot out of nowhere and yes it does suck when you can't even make it out of your spawn area but seriously? That's all part of the game! That's what makes it so fun! Someone has to get 92nd place.As far as server stability is concerend I've never had any issues. I have great internet and a nice gaming computer and rarely even lag while playing the game. Like I said nothing but fun. Squad que is even more fun than solo! I think honestly most of the negative reviews are fom people who just suck at the game. Ignore them. Buy the game if it looks good to you. I'd highly recommend it!,Recommended

"Alright I love this game......but NOTHING makes me angrier than getting killed by someone due to ""de sync"". I play this game a lot. Eventually you have to stop allowing players to compete with other players in china/the koreas. Region LOCK must happen. If a guy with 600 ping kills me well after im wayyyy inside a building the game is the issue. Constantly playing against guys with the name 264r5t276 or linxiaosha shouldnt be happening in solo's. Also hackers are still a miniscule problem. Doing good work stopping them tho and its greatly appreciated. Blizzard Ent. has a great setup to what people can name their characters specific guidlines on whats allowed maybe implement something of that nature. Honestly i could b**** so much about this game and the issues it has but at the end of the day its still one of my favorites. Nothing feels better than killing a bunch of people and earning them dinners. Feel free to add me on steam if you arent terrible. P",Recommended
Great game with nice graphics.Just need the stability/lock fps to make it more playable on low end PC for better aiming.Now there are few things to deal with CHEATERS!!! Almost on every servers thank God there's a DEADCAM to help us bit. Please deal with them make ur Anti Cheat more stronger. I hope you be ready for the massive logins after the PC 1.0 release it means that people will buy it and the server need to be more bigger to avoid the crash while in the game.Overall good. About 9 5/10 for my rating.Thx dev!,Recommended

PLAYERUNKNOWNS' BATTLEGROUNDS isn't like your typical battle royal game although it does share some of the same mechanics from previous battle royal games. First I'll go ahead and show you the pros and consPros+ Big playerbase I never have to worry about waiting to join a game+ Realistic+ Graphics are nice and smooth+ Sounds aren't horrible but it wouldn't hurt to improve them+Play invite system is great (You stay in the group even if you quit the game for instant playability when you log back on with your friends)+Improves upon H1Z1's KotK in everyt aspect+Loot system is a little slow but it makes up for it by having a lot to loot ( ie weapons and attachments)Cons There are some bugs but hey it's early access Some of the playerbase is loud and obnoxious on the mic but thankfully you can fix that with CTRL+T and mute them! Reward system isn't that rewarding (unless you just like killing and winning) It's early access so it's slightly not optomized. I get around 20 40fps with my 1070 AMD8350In conclusion I really enjoy playing this game I wish I could put more hours into it right now even as I'm typing this review. The only major gripe I have at the moment is the reward system. It takes forever to get BP to buy the crates which just causes grinding. I do recommend that you get this game! It was well worth my $30,Recommended

I really like the game the gameplay is really new (not many games that are very similar) and good. The controls make sense and feel really good.

The game can be a lot of fun to play. If optimization issues and bugs will trigger you then wait to purchase.The game has absolutely terrible desync issues which can frustrate anyone with a competitive drive for games like these. I can't tell you how many times I've been running forward or gotten behind a wall etc. only to be rubberbanded back and suddenly killed because the server decided that I died six feet back from where I was. CQB encounters can be extremely hit or miss as your crosshair is on someone either ADS or over the shoulder only to see your shots land harmlessly against the wall to their left approximately four feet from where you're aiming. Played over 70 hours so far and I am happy with my purchase. The game will be worth it when the dev's have more time to polish their game and actually iron out a lot of the optimization and netcode server issues.,Recommended
Addictive at first... Gets repetitive and loses attraction after some games..,Recommended

"Product received for free. Samuel ""cool"" man",Recommended
Fun Game too much De Sync. It Can Get to the point to where you just get behind a wall and get shot by a person on the other side of said wall. Region/Ping needs so badly to be implemented when running around in NA lobbies all you hear is Any Language besides those native to NA. I feel atleast region lock Solos because they cant play with friends in solos and if they are then ban them. I would reccomend this game I just feel instead of adding so much new content the devs need to fix the current issues at hand and hey maybe they will in the near future.,Recommended

I can see why so many people dislike this game now then before but this game really is a good game. Everyday PUBG gets more than one million players and if that much people are playing the game then you should look more into this game if you are more on the negative side right now. I have had this game since late July of 2017 and I still really like this game. For the time I have had this game only 100 or so hours isn't that much but if you want to play a lot of matches in one day you'll see it is kind of hard to do that (unless if you have friends of course). But playing a couple matches a day will not get you bored of the game (like I am right now) and you can still have fun playing it. There are some bugs some crashes and PUBG should of waited longer before releasing but if you want a game to play with your friends then try PUBG!Don't listen to the overpriced junk just play this game if you think you would enjoy it...8/10 Meows.,Recommended

This game is great absolutely amazing. PUBG will definitely take first place as the best Battle Royale/KOTH. I've followed this game throughout the closed beta and was really surprised by the amount of content implemented so early in it's development which shows to me that PlayerUnknown's team are really dedicated to making this the best possible experience for it's players. If you enjoy a more realistic take on the Battle Royale series (compared to H1Z1 KOTK) then this is the game for you.,Recommended
This is a great game. Don't let the high magnitude of poor reviews deter you from giving this game a shot. Yes there have been some major issues with the game but it is still early access and the devs were clearly not prepared for what came their way with the massive rise in popularity. However that shouldn't keep you from playing a game that at its core is an absolute blast to play.I think the game has a lot of areas it could improve in but it also stands out as a noteworthy and thoroughly exciting game.Pros Engaging combat that feels realistic Quick matches both lobby times and in game Lots of variance for play style slow games quick brawls stealthy its your choice how you play. Devs seem to be adding new content and fixing issues regularly A decently polished experience for being early accessCons The devs lack consistency no ads wait there will be ads no microtransactions nope now we have them etc.. Game has some lag and other minor technical issues nothing game breaking There are some missing features that would really make this game feel polished Crap graphics because you want high fps,Recommended
I wouldn't say I love this game but boy does it sure gives me a rush when you get near the end of the match and you have actually managed to have made it to the last few people. This predicament you have gotten yourself into can end in a release of ic ecstasy or in a realease of nothing but pure rage. I like to believe that experience is what makes this game worth it.,Recommended
Product received for free. Good,Recommended
Yee it's pretty good gameNot bad,Recommended
PUBG has possibly the greediest devs as this update finally made this game playable. It amazes me how the greed of these devs decided to come out with loot crates before optimizing their game? Other than keeping that in mind this new update has made the game much more playable and enjoyable. The devs put in a new map along with the long awaited and much needed optimization which make the game look and perform (for the most part) great.,Recommended

A great game with or without friends. Granted it seems hard to play with just 2 other friends and it much better suited for 1 2 or 4 cooperative players. Everything from the serious heart stopping moments to the quirky odd events that unfold make this game with playing over and over again.Being 130 hours of gameplay in I still find myself coming back for more again and again. The world is large enough that you will rarely be in the same position more than once should you not want to be in said situation.,Recommended

With 1400+ I can tell ya this game is legendary and is only going to get better. The updates for V1.0 looks very promising and will definitely add a different style of playing. The devs do take issues head on when they arise and try their best to resolve it in the fastest way possible. To enjoy the game and be able to play as long as I do I would get friends on as well as getting into discord server and have fun with others. 10/10.You'll read in the reviews about hackers... I haven't seen any or was to oblivious to notice any. However don't let that stop you from getting this game and support the devs to continue with this fine piece of art.,Recommended

I haven't had a game get my heart pumping like this ever. Awesome game. I hope they add multiple maps with different themes. The only criticisms I would have would be that the plane volume during the initial start of the game is very loud and makes it difficult to hear teammates discuss where to drop. Also footsteps are very loud. The changes the game has made so far via recent updates have been exactly what the community has wanted so I hope they continue that trend and make this an even better game! Definitely reccommend!,Recommended

This is the most productive game I've ever played. The gameplay is fun but the greatest part about it is when you die and have to wait for your friends to finish you have all the time to do the dishes wash laundry and do all the things you were avoiding by playing the game. You get the most out of this game if you have wireless headphones as you can still communicate with your friends while they are wasting their lives being successful in the game.I would definetely recommend this game as my house has never been this clean before.,Recommended
"It's actually a lot of fun... when you're not experiencing extreme optimization issues. You see PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds or PUBG For short has a lot of potential to be a great game to beat H1Z1 as a Battle Royale game but one of my teachers once said ""Potential is wasted energy."" PUBG's potential can be squandered if the devs decide to pull some DayZ but it seems like the devs are working hard. Do I recommend this game? Sure but I would absolutely suggest waiting for an update or a sale.",Recommended

Player Unknown Battlegrounds... Or specially known as PUBG. If you like Battle Royal games then this is what I would start with. But be warned when I say that there is an update every single week. Usually 3 4 days. But nevertheless PUBG has some pros and cons.Lets start with the Pros The weapons are equally usable and strong the bulletdrop isnt bad and there are many ways to kill your opponent. Now the Cons Optimazation could use a lot of work to many updates and a lot of people trash talk to much. Now I wont complain about the players because you can always turn off public voice chat. So it wont really matter. But there are a lot of them just to get that out there. Updates are usually about 20 25mb when updating. Which isnt bad. But the huge updates are what im worried about. 6 10gb updates are usually what they go for. So just be prepaired for them. I always keep a spare hard drive somewhere for when they do release huge update.But as always PUBG is a great game and I would definitely recommend this game for all the hardcore players. Its fun to mess around to. Playing with your friends is the best part about playing PUBG. So invite your friends and give it a go!,Recommended
I recommend this game under certain circumstances. This game in its current state is broken. It is in Early Access for a reason. Please fully consider what you are doing before getting this game. It will make you mad happy and very depressed all at the same time. I have over 600 hrs and have gotten slightly bored with it but I have also had alot of fun playing it.Pros Great conceptFunCons (All becuase it is in early access)Currently a broken messTons of hackersSome terrible game mechanics,Recommended
dis lit son. 10/10. i run it like but idgaf i love the game not the graphics. altogether got me 7 wins in solo/duo/squads so far. devs are ing amazing updating the game so much and i expect it just to get better and better with each update. i would like more optimization updates first just so at the least i can get 60fps at all times im usually 45 50ish but its still very playable and ill accept that just becasue the gameplay is very fun. they fixed alot of the server issues beforehand and are also adding new content as they are fixing the game internally. keep it up devs love yall.,Recommended
Very Fun,Recommended
Buggy But most likely will be a fantastic game when finished,Recommended
Best money I have ever spent. Despite a laggy servers and a few glitches this game is more than fun. It will get your heart racing when there are 13 people left and you you running to get in the circle. Each map offers an abundance of loot and tons of great places to have a shoot. It is always a trill to atempt to climb to the top of 99 people to get your chicken dinner.,Recommended

With all the games in my steam library I can't recommend any of them as highly as I would this title the most fun i've had in a game probaly since I played Goldeneye on 64 or Halo 2 on xbox live way back when. Never had anything get the adreneline rushing like this game. Great solo or with freinds all this is just based off what the early access offers so far. I can't wait to see where this game goes and what it grows into. IMHOp.s. H1z1 was one of the games I built my first pc to play and was woefully disapointed they have made strides but the game is still majorly lackluster to me this game encapsulates all that of which I thought H1z1 would when i first bought it Player unkown and the team thanks for this gem that is battlegrounds,Recommended
This is amazing BUT there is one problem... I am always getting team killed and they dont get punished. I reccomend adding a team kill punishmentThank you.,Recommended

To be honest despite all those hate reviews i personally think this game is awesome. The gun sound the the environment the physics it just great. It will be 100 time better if you play with friends that just want to have fun and didnt mind losing. Because gaming isnt all about winning its about enjoying it. But i hope the developer would be more matured in dealing with the problem such as hacker. And please optimize the game so that low end pc can also play it at decent fps. The more the merrier right?,Recommended
ver nic,Recommended
Personally for me PUBG was always a slippery slope I used to hate it back then when there was only 1 map and well optimization. After the 1.0 patch and then some other patches the game feels really good. Does it have bugs? Hell yeah it does. But do they distrupt your fun or get you tired of the game? Hell no! Playing this with my friends Is the best and most fun times I've ever had in my life. Winning games just makes me want to play more the gun physics are good vaulting and parkouring is really fleshed out and has close to no bugs in my own experience. I recommend you give this game a go If you're used to fps shooters like CSGO or any other battle royale titles. Believe me this game is the superior one ),Recommended
China Is Number one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Recommended
pretty good honestly,Recommended
Product received for free. Needs some fixing but all around i think this game is really good. After some updates and server fixes the game really can't get much better. I would def keep an eye on what is happening to the game.EDIT As I put in my first review I do really like this game maybe even love it. Considering I put an extra 100+ hours on it since my last review. Now it looks like im going to have to change my review because ever since PLAYERUNKOWN told the world about this new anti cheat it seems there is a hacker every game now and i simply cannot enjoy it anymore. There is a hacker atleast every other game if not everygame. Once they crack down on hackers then i have no issues with the game other than some optimization and server fixes.EDIT #2 With the recent version 1.0 coming out i feel like the issues i have stated before have changed a lot and i could go back to recommending it.,Recommended

Now I got into this game after playing King of the kill which I was kinda mad they made a amped of version of the same game....But after playing it for a couple hours Iknew it was worth it and upgraded version of King of the kill with overall better gameplay my favorite part was the upraded shooting mechanics and the overall upgraded graphics in the game wish there was a little more crafting and easier to get new items for your charecter but overall addicting and exciting game....7.5/10,Recommended

A really good game thats bad but still so good,Recommended
a superb BR type of game with heavy focus on guns and weapons. follow the realism path theres a lot of details that make every game you play a unique experience. pubgs gameplay is something you can never get tired off everything is fine tuned and still get improved overtime by devs. sure there are bugs and glitches that you still have to deal with every now and then but i dont think its a major down side. instead hack is still a big part of the game given how pubg is still in its prime time. devs ve been taking action and i have faith in their decisions. i recommend this game because it has a lot of potential in the future. possibly become one of the most important tiltle in this decade,Recommended
How many hours until I get good?,Recommended
the game is amazing i hav had allot of fun with except for the chinese doods.. if chinese people could have their own dedicated server i think that would fix all my problems with the game,Recommended
"Let's go through a list of events that will take place to see if you like what you read 1. Join a lobby of up to 100 players waiting for the match to start.2. After countdown hits zero everyone is spawned inside of a cargo plane. Once you reach a certain part of the island you can eject from the plane at anytime you wish except at the end of it's flight path it auto ejects you from the plane and you go skydiving down with any others who chose not to eject.3. As mentioned above you skydive toward your desired location the parachute will auto chute if you choose not to pull the chute. You will then get to steer yourself toward any direction you please.4. You land on your feet. You search the nearest building for resources. Some games you'll find a M16 some a pistol and then some clothes and an iron pan. The randomness is refreshing.5. You ready to go look for others to kill? The more you kill the more your points rack up. Don't really care for leaderboards? Just run around find a vehicle fire shots into the air to lure others to the sound or whatever it is you love to do to pass the time. No telling where other players are.6. Large map how are you going to find anyone? Oh the map has a circle on it which is the ""Play Area"". This over time will shrink and anyone caught outside the circle is drained of their health until they die. So it's a few minutes here shrink a few minutes there shrink again until the circle gets so small there is an infinity chance the match will end quickly.7. Did you die already? It's ok. As soon as you die you are given your stats for the session and you can go back to the main menu to start another match with another 100 people. It's that quick and easy there is no waiting til the end of the match to watch it unfold... though I hope the option becomes available in the future. It might be fun to kick back and relax after a lengthy session.8. Rinse and Repeat.Note I have not done a duo or squad matchup.Recommend? I do if you can get your rig to give you some good FPS. Mine is decent I had to go through an act of Congress to fix some issues. (It was easy btw there was no one alive in Congress so I signed the act forms myself)If PUBG is not optimized well for you there is always the Steam Refund.Personally I just like to have fun collecting a few guns getting in a vehicle and drive around. Hell I'll get a jeep and sit in the #5 seat (Back seat middle) and see if anyone notices. Everyone has noticed me so far. One day I hope to sit back there and someone take the jeep without knowing I was there the whole time.""Ok it's just us two. I'm driving around he's gotta be here somewhere."" Little does he/she know.......",Recommended

A game who change my life and heart &lt 3,Recommended
extensive report on the frying pan Metal OP,Recommended
This game is fantastic but after 400+ (1100+) hours I'm beginning to get a little sick and tired of poor bullet registry. That is not to say that this is a regular occurence but it only needs to happen ONCE per game and you are going to die and it's just luck if you survive. This game really is an interactive gambling addiction the r n g is much better than it was if you include variety in your game play. The investment of time can be a little limiting however it is what it is. For people with approx 36 minutes to kill (Per top 2 round) There's no Quake style deathmatch which this game could do with especially if it were unranked 40 players choose a kit to practice with and have a 1 kilometer playground to fight in.Ed. 3. Since the latest patch.. Every single round I've been killed by a cheater Every time I've played solo I've been killed under very suspicious circumstances. It's not desync either or video lag. I can't recommend this game to anyone under the current conditions.Ed. 4. 2 weeks ago very few cheaters on servers. Today (09/03/2018) Played roughly 30 matches and there in each game bar 2 were cheaters. I'm glad I have regular squad mates who don't just quit. Why are cheaters so hell bent on destroying this game? Oh that's right. THey can get items from crates which are worth a tonne.Ed. 5. Cheaters are returning and vanishing on a bi weekly basis */5/2018 but that's always going to be a constant and uphill struggle in pvp atleast that is what I've come to accept. They actually implemented weekly events such as 50 player deathmatch! The new map (Savage) is fun as !,Recommended
When you drop for the first time and you dont know what to do and until you think that you are already dead and after many many matches you get your first chicken priceless.... The is very addictive with lots of laughs with the squad altho still there are some bugs here and there also it needs a super toaster to run properly have fun!,Recommended

Ever since Dayz mod I have been looking for that heart throb of a game. No other games released since have given the feel of a 20 min firefight at Nw airfield... Until now. Every match is just that. Get the loot survive for a little until the playzone gets you... or a player does.Playing on GTX 1070 It runs like a dream except the unpolished moments of an earlyrelease.,Recommended

I absoulty love this game. Even if I am bad at it I still enjoy it. I dont mind these loot boxes as long as they are available for free aswell. I really hope this game does not die like DayZ. Looking forward to seeing more and more updates to this great game.Edit Cant wait for Patch 1.0 the game just got optimized even more and looks great! I cant wait!,Recommended
Optimization should be better (it's hard to play on a bad cpu) but it's nice and fun especially with friends. ),Recommended
From the first few rounds I have played I was hooked. I highly recommend this game if you love battle royale and a more militaristic type of gameplay compare to the cartoonish H1Z1. There is a few optimization issues and the game back screen once in a while but the developer are constantly releasing updates and always look forward to giving us more content and bug fixes to improve the game.,Recommended
After watching several Twitch streamers play this game during closed beta and the past couple weekends I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try. With 3 hours played I'm at a ratio of I think 1.3 kills/hour. Yes 1.3 KILLS not wins per hour. I totally suck at this game but my first kill was from punching and I'm having a good time.It's a very fun game if you're into the Battle Royale genre. It still needs a lot of polish but I'm confident it will get that over the next several months before official release.,Recommended

It's early access know what that means before you buy this do your homework on previous developers who have and have not met their promises with EA titles. Now with that said and that risk taken I think it was worth it and I have faith it'll pay off more and more as time goes on. The good gameplay is exciting visuals are great map is generally very interesting to play with more weather systems day/night cycles and other maps on the way. matchmaking is lightning fast you are in within seconds of clicking the play button least in my experience (100+ hours played now) guns are not arcadey feeling like a strange place between arma and h1z1 leaning more in the direction of arma. variation for weapons is good but not overwhelming custom matches can be good (if you can get in one) much potential for great setups on this (first person only mode is a must try)the bad the desync in the game at times is unbearable a lot of rubber banding on various servers in EU for myself not always but very often optimization has been worked on but i sincerely hope there is much more to come. On a 980ti with i74790K and i struggle running this game at 60 FPS on medium settings. Even low doesn't seem to do much. Having seen others with 1080ti's of all things and even better CPUs running into the same problems I know this cannot simply be my machine especially when I run other 2016 released AAA games on ultra without breaking a sweat hitting 144fps + with no issues (SW Battlefront The Division Battlefield 1 to name a few). guns don't feel great this could just be a personal thing though. I think take that with a pinch of salt and decide for yourself I could just be a really crap player afterall (in fact I know I am).That said I am HOOKED. I love this game and I would recommend it if you are coming from the likes of H1Z1 KOTK or ARMA Battle Royale.,Recommended
"Overview It's a ""Battle Royale"" game third or first person shooter 100 players + a big map with weapons to lootYour goal be the last one to stay alive! Is it a fun game? Depends on what kind of player you are......if you are unpatient and want fast paced action then this is most likely not your type of game....but if you like to loot stuff like to patiently wait for your target are the kind of person who wont go mad if you die...even if you spend so much time in a match looting the best gear just to get one shotted in the head by someone you didnt even know where the someone was then this is your game.EDIT currently in this game there are a lot of cheaters (especially on higher ranks) despite the devs banning many already",Recommended

Best Battle Royale Game ever. It's thrilling and brutal and pretty realistic too if you compare it to other FPS games. (Minus the bugs but it's still early access so I won't rate the bugs and performance. I play it on a 1080GTX with a 4XXX gen i5 and it runs better with every update on Ultra.

I was lucky enough to get a key free while this game was in alpha testing. Each time the servers have opened the optimizations have improved and each update seems to be taking the game in the right direction towards becoming an awesome finished product. Fps still struggles in the city but as it is an early access game I am sure the devs will keep improving optimizations to improve this,Recommended
Honestly I bought this game a while ago and I love it. Everyone says it's a knockoff but a knockoff can be good especially if they do it better than the last one. PUBG is my favorite game right now. I would have so many mroe hours in it if I had more time and my friends would play it more with me. This game can be fun solo but duos are the most fun you could ever have. I convinced so many of my friends to buy this game and they all love it. We have had so many good memories in this game all the way from Gatka to Lopovka and Stalber to the Military Base. Of course if you go in and get destroyed immediately because you're a noob that decides to go to Pochiniki your first play through you're gonna hate it but I played like a little mouse when I started this game and enjoyed it. I am now so bored witht that play style and drop in a highly populated area like the school murder everyone there then hunt people. When I hear a gunshot I go towards it. That's how I love to play this game. Before you buy RNG loot spawning can and will screw you over all of the time. If you go into this game expecting to be good leave don't buy it. You will die over and over. I've been playing for close to 200 hours and still haven't won a game. I've gotten so close so many times. I on average get to the top 10 just about every game unless I'm being way to risky and playing like a maniac. Even never winning I love this game. It's so fun. It was absolutely worth the 30 or 40 dollars I spent on it. There are several bugs with this game.. because it's new. The bugs can be bad like you dropping 4 feet in a car and it exploding or your friend getting stuck in a door and you have to down him to get him out etc. etc. The terrain is poorly shaped in some areas there are little mounds that kill me every time when I'm on a bike riding around and just go flying 200ft in the air. The map is so big I still haven't discovered all of it. There are certain small areas I haven't been. And I just started going to places like Primorsk the quarry and the city in the very North West of the map. I've trained so many noobs it's not funny. And some of them still can't play right. However sometimes they surprise you. The main one that CAN play right just the other day we drove off to a little place with about 7 houses just west of the School and Legos. We were playing squads and we serperated because our other two friends had decided to go off to some random place. We were in the same house I heard footsteps a ways off and saw someone coming to our door. I backed up instantly killed him as he came through the door. I was seen through the window and ran back further into the house. I got into a side room and my squadmate was in an adjacent room. The only way they could get us was to come down a hallway. I had a UMP9 and he had a pump action shotgun. One guy ran down the hallway and jumped in between us. My squadmate shot... Perfectly through the space between his arm and his gun and one shot me to the ground. He ended up wasting the entire clip trying to down then kill him. He ran into the room and got me up. The enemies wasted their times throwing grenades instead of charging. I got up and healed about halfway. My squadmate went back to his side of the hallway and peaked around shot a few times then got downed. I peaked around instantly headshotted a guy with a lvl 3 helmet and downed him then his teammate came to the window and one shot me cause my helmet already broke. Our two even noobier friends despite our cries never came to help us so we died. And the one guy on that team survived. It would have been okay but the circle had passed over us as they were coming. So many good and bad memories have happened on this game. I love it and will continue playing it until it reaches it's peak in my excitement which won't happen for a while. This game is still fairly new and still updating I can't wait for the new maps and vaulting system to come out. I give PUBG a 9/10. I highly recommend especially if you like shooters and looting games.,Recommended
Devs screwed up but certainly do not deserve so much hate considering the work they've done on the 1.0 update. Bravo bluehole,Recommended
Keep in mind that the game is early access.If you forgive the bugs lag and occasional modder...It's a great battle royale game that functions properly and is very addictive and fun to play with others.,Recommended

In the beginning I wrote a scathing review of this game. I pointed out the rampant cheating problems and persistent lack of any meaningful optimization updates. However plenty has changed and now I must say that PUBG is starting to look like a real game not a trashy early access experiment. I still don't think it was worth $30 perhaps $20 or $25 would have been more reasonable because let s face it the game is far from finished. In my opinion the 1.0 update was pushed out the door a little too early and I would have liked to see them hold back and focus on delivering the best 1.0 experience that they could. Don't get me wrong 1.0 wasn't bad but it could have been better. The optimization problem seems to be one that is seriously haunting this dev team and that was evident in the release of Miramar I do realise that considerable efforts have been made in the war of optimization however the dev team seems to focus more on new content than anything else. The latest big patch brought us Sanhok and I must say Sanhok is extremely impressive it totally shook up the gameplay making faster and more intense than ever before games are shorter firefights are far more engaging and the overall experience is highly refreshing. Sanhok also runs well it is by far the most well optimized map and does not compromise visual quality and detail. It looks outstanding. Despite the fact that PUBG doesn t really push the graphical capabilities of the Unreal Engine you can tell that some real effort went into Sanhok. I still think that it is possible to make the game look much better and at the same time increasing FPS because of the Unreal Engine however it not much of a concern. They knocked Sanhok out of the park and proved to me that they really are capable and that PUBG still has immense potential. PUBG is losing players faster than people would have expected. There are a variety of reasons such as other games like Fortnite dominating the market. However one could make a strong case that along with Fortnite drawing players away a significant cause of the decreasing player numbers is PUBG starting to stagnate. Millions of people bought this game back when there was massive hype surrounding it. People just wanted to get involved in this huge new game but soon realised that it gets boring. Sadly PUBG does get boring from time to time changes and exciting updates are generally few and far between for PUBG and when they arrive the new content is behind a pay wall such as what we got with this ridiculous event pass stunt that they pulled. In short PUBG is fun for a little bit and then people generally just go and play something that will keep them engaged for longer. PUBG also lacks the marketing and PR brilliance that Epic Games has Fortnites success can be largely attributed to it outstanding marketing. PUBG just struggles to keep up in this area and the few trailers that get shown are not even close to the actual gameplay. They show massive explosions and crazy 10 man shootouts but none of this happens in the actual game. If PUBG upped the effort on market they might be able to claw back some of their lost players.Overall I m too lazy to write a 2000 word review covering everything good and bad about this game. But I will say that its getting a lot better the latest changes are pushing the game higher and higher and its great to see. There is still plenty to be done and a load of room for improvement however PUBG in my eyes is on the right track. I recommend this game to anyone who is patient enough to endure little bugs and the occasional FPS drop overall PUBG is a decent game that can be made great given the proper changes and fixes.,Recommended
This game needs to be improved especially in shooting some of the shots are not getting to be registered on the enemy,Recommended

Recently there have been an uptick of negative reviews but those are mostly trolls. It is true that once you breach the top 500 it is rampant with cheaters it is also true that NA servers are filled with people who should be playing in the Asia servers. But the developers are activly optimising and fixing the game for the 1.0 patch. The game is very fun and there is a reason why it's been purchased so much.,Recommended

"The good Super fun loot and shoot. Winning feels more amazing than almost any other game I've ever played. Beautiful graphics and excellent physics. Recently added a ""parkour"" system of sorts and a second map bringing a lot of people back to a similar level of play purely on strategic loot grabs.The bad ""2017 running simulator of the year!"" New map has very few cars where you drop very well may be where you die. Putting 3 shots into someone may not kill them but hitting you once in the head from twice the distance with iron sights off an MP9 might.The ugly All aesthetic rewards which used to be free with your in game reward points from wins have gone pay to open on an already paid for game. The developer is clearly more interested in cash grabbing than bug fixes. The servers are often ""too busy"" which... if you're charging every player 2.50/box and you're averaging 3 million players/day bro... you got enough moolah to bug fix.Final Summary Beautiful game that is great fun to play but needs more attention from it's founder.",Recommended
I may only have 100 hours but that dosen't give up the fact that there is challange and cooperation needed at any obsticle in this game.Sure there may be glitches bugs and hackers but laughing it off and talking about how they can fix it may work better than giving comments depicting how the developer is. REMEMBER it is EARLY ACCESS. It hasent been out for 3 years yet so there is a ton of reworking/optomization for those with computers.Today is thanksgiving why not be thankful for the fact this game formed a unison between battleground games and are destined to make them better.,Recommended

definately my favorite Battle Royale game. Having said this more content related updates (eg. maps weapons vehicles) would increase the amount of players since a lot of them have quite due to the lack of new content. The purchasable crates using BP should not cost more steam credits to open we spent $37 already to play the game!,Recommended
Do not buy this game unless you're willing to deal with the growing pains of an early access game. With that being said don't buy this game if you aren't prepared for to stay in early access for a long time. It has bugs it has hackers it has a lot of changes. The game will continue to change even after access. Do not expect it to cater to your feelings or desires. Now that the PSA is done... PUBG is a lot of fun. It's a very intense very boring very unpredictable loot/running/battle royale simulator. Prepare to enjoy yourself and rage for a little bit.UPDATE 2/14/18 game still is littered with bugs desync and hacking after early access y u do dis pubgupdate 6/20/18 this game kthnxbye,Recommended

This game is really hard and extremely hard to win if you're new to the genre of open world kind of games. Posting a bad review just cause you got unlucky on acouple games or cant shoot a gun properly doesn't mean you can just give it a bad review..

What is interesting to me is that since I bought the game 40 matches and top 2% (What the game says) I have only crossed one cheater a lot of chinese people yeah but life is better when you turn off voice chat for everyone aside your team. I played like 5 matches before the ping limit update and of course the death cam is weird but at least is obvious that at least if in the death cam the killer is not looking at you or far from you it's a cheater otherwise it's a normal player. Or at least from what I have seen and known.Fun fact The latest updates only brought little frame drops for me but no issues like many other players are suffering.,Recommended

Now let's start out with my actual opinion on the game it is a well balanced game interns of weapon damage and the gameplay is fair (kind of) however the bugs are decently funny in terms of the bikes but it kills you and after the laughing it just becomes one of those disapointed sighs so yeah good game the hype has gone so its kind of not gaining players and the bugs are funny yet annoying and in the trailer that guy backflips a bike in the real game you would end up dead %100.,Recommended

This game is not as easy as you would first assume. Great game it is in early access and buggy at times but overall really worth the money. The developers are constantly taking feedback and making the game more fun. Buy this game before it gets expensive.,Recommended

"TL DR Decent at shooters? Want a game that'll get your adrinaline pumping at a decently reliable rate? Have some goddamn patience? Have a good rig? Have friends to play with?If you got at least 4/5 then go ahead and get the gameIf not then hold off and come back once the storm settles. Probably like a month or three after the 1.0 release.I'm that guy out in the middle of a thunderstorm soaking in the rain while everybody else it scrambling for cover. The game is flawed that's why that ""Early Access Game"" banner that people seem to have forgotten about is still up there but I've still heavily enjoyed my time playing it. I understand that people are about the optimization issues the ping/server tick issues and the hacking issues but... ehh. I'm trying to look at the bigger picture in all this and see how far they've come and to be honest I'm not really disapointed. The dev team is slow as but they are moving in the direction we ask them to. Every time we get an update you see optimization in the patch notes. You don't always feel it but occasionally it becomes your turn and you revel in the boost. The network issues I don't have a position to talk about. They added an aditional server last update but since it didn't affect the U.S side of things people kinda glossed it over (I'm stationed in Korea right now though so I'm loving it.) Can't be about the hackers either. Classic case of the few ing over the many. As of Nov2017 +700 000 hackers have been banned. dude I'm not dissapointed I'm impressed. That's about $21 000 000 in accounts. China you got some tenacity.Ya'll s need to chill.",Recommended
You either get a bunch of kills and a ton of action or you end up spending an hour looting only to get shot in the head.Good game would recommend.,Recommended
Liked the game pretty fun really satisfying when you get a kill and really gives you the rush when you're in combat. If you're playing in the asia / southeast asia servers try not to get too annoyed by the micspam and the profanities (in chinese) if you don't understand that's even better lol but it gets way too annoying after a while. Would be better if you are matched up with people near you or have a country based system for servers but overall great game,Recommended
I love this game and usually play it every week but recently it's been everyday. The only thing I wish for was for vaulting to be added in sooner would make jumping some of those cement walls a tonne easier! I'm happy with all of the updates being made except I would like if the reporting system could include a way to select a player in your team that you wish to report because some of the people you meet in squads are just horrid. Needs an abuse/sexist/racism button against teammates and also if you believe one of your teammates is using hack you should be able to report them too!Other than those little wishes I absolutely love this game and have been regularly enjoying it!,Recommended
Well let me first say this game is a lot things..it has a certain atmosphere of fun anticipation anxiety paced reward (if your lucky after you deployed to find something other than a pistol. But most of all the silence is deafening until that first sudden shot rings out..then..OMG fear sets..then the pace picks up you're scrambling to find a more powerful weapon in hopes not to be seen. Phew..then you find shotguns..oh love them for close range but that one guy thats shooting you happens to be a presteen sharp shooter..ugh then your crawling from your current location..and bam there's that weapon and scope you've been waiting for.......you turn around and blammo headshot..damn! Love the pace love the risk/reward and the tactical aspects..love the fun and laughs. Downside Netcode..is tooooooo low..far off lands use the USA servers which can lag the game periodically..jumping or vaulting needs work..(tested it on the test server..pretty good) new maps need to be implimented..but overall..awesome game FUN!!!,Recommended
"v1.0 is a farcry from what this game version should be. ""1.0"" signifies a finished game. This game is anything but. It is borderlining Alpha and will likely not ever be in a finished state because of indie developer's tendancies to get money and never finish the game they promised. Early access in a nutshell. Still it is a great game and concept. Very rough around the edges and has a lot of bugs to work out not to mention the massive number of players hacking the game. It is not the kind of game you play for casual fun. It can be incredibly frustrating and gives almost nothing for a paid game. Fortnight's Battle Royale gives more casual entertainment from a free to play than PUBG's outrageous $30 price point. Costmetic upgrades are obtained at a slower rate than any other game I have ever played and are mostly downright boring. It's basically a slap in the face after paying for a game that has less content than most FTP games outhere. I still recommend the game because I have faith in the developers and they are going in a good direction. Giving players a little more customization wouldn't hurt since we paid for the game. Other than that it is a genuinely fun game when you have friends to play it with. Solo matches are just chaos however.",Recommended

They look like they got a kindergarten class heading the map design team and yet this is not even one of the things i dont like about this game.Bad gun mechanics Trash hitboxes lack of contentTons of camping (and i dont mean camping in a smart spot to get a kill i mean in a bathroom in the damn tub for 20 mins camping)High high and mariana trench low this game is quite passable but dont listen to me and be another sucker to buy this game lolPubg the most successful jogging simulator of all time,Recommended
This game is brilliant. I love this game totally after 1.0 official update the fps now is stable spike lag are there but it had reduced a lot. I'm easily gettin a 100 fps without fps spike. The graphics now looks more sharp and clear and now i can spot players from a considerable amount of distance lol xD. Overall the game is now more stable and fun to play. I'll keep updating this review from time to time for suggestions and bugs ) Every kill is a skill and every death is a lesson !&amp please never ever replace the background music at the starting of the game its really really good.,Recommended
DayZ Hated it. Arma Despised it. H1Z1 Loathed it. PUBG Best game I have ever played.I am not normally one to make detailed reviews but if you have not already bought this game you need to now. Pros Balanced weaponsAmazing soundHuge mapCharacter customizationPlane that flies overhead and looks amazingLots of attachmentsDoes not take forever to get started just jump in and playServers are lightning fast and put you in games immediatelyDifferent levels of gear to look forDifferent modes (solo duo four person)Constant updatesHardly any noticeable bugsLoot is plentiful so you never need to worry about not having anythingAmazing shooting mechanicsAnd last of all it is just downright amazing to playCons Spawning out of plane moving in straight line with 100 other players is annoyingGraphics will strain your system even on high / medium settings (I have a 6GB 1060 and get around 50 FPS)Home screen is unappealingAnd then last of all the community. The community of this game is by far the most hilarious game community I have ever encountered. One game for example while flying overhead to spawn everyone started singing magic school bus and we all dropped to our eventual doom below. Another instance six of us all landed on a school and some guy started running around with an UMP singing pumped up kicks. Another game a man chased me for a good three minutes then beat me to death for an apple I threw at him. Overall this is by far the best game community I have ever been in and have loved every moment of this game. I highly recommend this game to anyone who comes across it and urge you to buy it immediately and get started on the fun. 10/10 Would get killed for an apple again.,Recommended
Best game ever! Been playing literally 16/24 a dau!,Recommended
Bought it after an add on Facebook. 10/10 would buy it again )So far so good. Instant action you dont waste time searching for guns and ammo like similar games. Pure PvP.,Recommended
It's like H1Z1 King of the Kill but you can see that the developers actually give a about the game and the playerbase rather than simply making a quick buck. If you are worried about the EA release simply wait until it's fully released as they have stated it to be around 6 months time from EA launch.,Recommended
Extremely fun. It is a simplified version of Arma's BR with amazing gunplay. Much better than H1Z1 due to added realism with the gunplay and graphically it is more appealing. Would rate 9/10. There are some performance issues but that's expected due to it being early access. For the most part I get 60+FPS with a 1070 but when entering towns the FPS can drop as low at 25FPS.,Recommended
Great game needs optimization but once they get that sorted out this game will be amazing! Love the attachments and the weapons. Make sure you have a good pc if you're planning on getting the game right now as of 03 27 2017. Performance update coming April. 7/10 right now imo.,Recommended

I have to say that the arguments that people are making against the developers are very valid especially those addressing the fact that the cosmetic clothing goes beyond cosmetics. It really does matter what you wear in this game because camouflage is incredibly important. Someone wearing dark colored clothing is a lot less visible than someone wearing a yellow jumpsuit. In the final circles this can be absolutely critical.With all of that being said I've never had so much fun in a tactical shooter. Playing with friends in a squad is some of the most rewarding gameplay I've personally experienced. Yes there are bugs and no it is not e sports ready but as a casual gamer I don't care about these issues as much as others would. There's nothing more satisfying to me than getting kills with the kar98 at range against a moving target. Playing with a squad is incredibly satisfying when each player is competent and has some situational awareness. I recommend the game as it stands currently and hope that the developers continue to make improvements instead of abandoning the game.,Recommended

"As Yahtzee would say PUBG is a ""Spunk Gargle Wee Wee"" shooter. But I feel like it's a more refined version of Spunk Gargle Wee Wee. Sure its art style is brown and grey lacking a lot in colour and variation and the core gameplay is just get gun shoot man but for all its simplicty and lack of originality it at least owns it and it does it well. Should you get it? Pobably probably not. Its a vastly superior experience if played with a friend or two.",Recommended

Product received for free. Needs a lot of work but overall it's a fun game as long as you don't take it too seriously.,Recommended
It's pretty good I guess...,Recommended
fliping awsome game.. thank you,Recommended
Product received for free. Score? 9 of 10 ),Recommended
this game is fun but it really doesnt give youy anything to shoot for as far as earning for your avatar as far as rewards go,Recommended
Even though it is an early access game it has so much potential to be a great game. I find that it is far more enjoyable than it is unenjoyable. If you have a good group of friends to play this game then you will be fine. New maps are in the works which is awesome however would be cool to see new vics or weapons put in *hint hint* maybe a PKM?!?,Recommended
Best battle royale game out atm highly recommend this game for anyone who are into battle royale games.,Recommended
I love this game but I still don't understand why it needs so much pc. Lots of my frineds wanna play it but they cannot because thier pcs doesnt support the game even though their pcs are new and have good components. Online games souldn't demand much hardware.,Recommended
Its fun to play with friends. There are cheaters. Most of them are chinese that play on the North America servers. They should be region locked from NA servers.,Recommended
This is the best battle royal game on the market today . The development team is working hard and doing weekly updates . You just don't see that in early access releases. it's a nice change. I feel that the game will only get better if development keeps up with these updates .Things I think development should consider improving are Car mechanics More laying down / sitting positions ex like arma 3 better Indoor/close quarters combat mechanics increase loot by 10 15% server lag,Recommended
nice game,Recommended
its fun,Recommended
This game is pretty good I mean as long as you have a friend to play it with it's fun!,Recommended
dont see anyone all game then get punted by a kar98 from 7 miles awaystill a better experience than fortnite,Recommended

This game is very fun but has a lot of lag in the servers,Recommended
*Launches game* *Freezes* *Crashes computer**Launches game again* *Gets in a solo match* *Places 33rd* *Starts another match* *Places 10th**Starts another match* *Places 7th* Game does run badly its badly optimized would wait for the full release of the game but if you want to play it now nothing stops you its alot of fun7/10,Recommended
10/10m 20/20. Amazing realistic game i feel everyone should at least try once.,Recommended
Chicken Dinners are illusive not worth the effort and yet impossible to get out of my mind. 10/10.,Recommended

I love this game D,Recommended
I mean so far in my server (SEA) I haven't encountered cheaters or hackers. So you know good game 10/10,Recommended
DDDDD,Recommended
This game is a well done product the only thins i dont like is the rewards system.There is not good rewards for playing the game just several clothes.,Recommended
Watching this game go through development has showed the pros and cons of the game but overall I do still enjoy this game so much.Pros very simple to understand and jump into/easy controls fun to play with solo or with friends multiple ways to play the game(i.e. screw around go for wins)Cons not greatly optimized(getting better!) lag spikes/crashes,Recommended
Product received for free. This game is cool,Recommended
easy peasy lemon squeezy,Recommended

Join a game. get ear by 46 year old men. Jump out of plane and find a shotty. 2 guys come in my house and i blast them away. steal their gear and run. get into a field and get sniped by Scar L..... 10/10 would get gear stolen again.,Recommended

A shooter that s as invested in creating a smart Heart Pounding survival experience that is as fun as is action packed.Battlegrounds wastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as up to 100 players join a server and pick their moment to jump out of a plane and parachute onto a large 8x8 km island. From there you can decide whether to jump early which lets you hit the ground first giving you a jump on the competition. Or you may also place yourself farther from the center of the arena and loot freely with little to no interference. Its Battle Royal so once you land you need to find weapons and start killing to move to the next area of the map because there is this thing call the zone thats marked by a white circle. You need to stay in that circle as it continues to shrink closing in the amount of land players can be on. if you set out of the save zone you'll lose health gradually.If you are Action driven and love the feeling of your heart pounding by the sec then Jumping right into the center especially in large cities where most players drop will place you right in the middle of the action.Whether its when your acending from the sky and your chute opens and you realize your not alone in the area as everybody scrambles for weapons and gear. Killing begins right from the get go. Be it by melee weapons like sicles and crowbars or even small arms fire like pistols. Theres no running from death. One of the most humerous things is Super man Punching someone. This action which is the combination of jumping and punching sends your character leaping in the air only to have them sending a forceful blow to an opponent. Weapons you pick up are never loaded unless you pick them up from a dead player However ammo is usually next to where the weapon are. With this in mind Another cool and humerous moment you can try which requires great timing if it presents its self to you is when you find a player about to pick up a Weapon go next to them and pick up the ammo D it will send them in a mad craze Thats when you punch the crap out of them and get the gun ) You'll always start off with nothing however dont worry from there you'll be in search for Backpacks for holding more items a handful of protective gear like helmets and police vests healing items melee weapons and a good mix of firearms which are in all good supply.Happy Hunting Everyone!! May the fitest Survive I'll see you on the Island!!! Just a warning **Becareful I may be on the other side of that bathroom door in that house you just walked into with a shotgun aimed right at your head**,Recommended
I'm around 35 solo matches in and scored one chicken dinner. Great game with solid gameplay. It captures the vibe of DayZ and makes matches digestable with good loot distribution easy controls good interface and a match time of around 15 to 30 minutes.Performance still needs improving. On an FX 8300 GTX 1060 16GB RAM I get around 30 to 60 FPS (Medium settings. Shadows and Foliage on Very Low). There is something to be said about the positivity around this game. I've never encountered overly toxic trash talking which is rare in a competetive shooter. Let's hope it stays this way.,Recommended
Everything that DayZ mod did right plus streamlined predictable game mechanics great performance and a proper lobbying system. This is the best game I've ever played.,Recommended
Oops the Chinese are review bombing again.,Recommended
Same map same gun's but never the same match! This game is simply awesome. I just hope the base of the game stays the same and not too much changes into the future.,Recommended
Game feels great after they added ranks.,Recommended
Thrilling punishing addictive sometimes unfair and you always need some luck ),Recommended
It's a great game!!!,Recommended
"I have over 400 hours in this game and in the past couple of months i've seen such a great improvement of the game.Pros 1 fun to play with friends2 solo isn't half bad especially if you want to have just quick matchmaking and get some frags for fun. Dropping high pop areas on solo matches can be a rush3 the weapon selection and customization are great and they are always adding new weapons4 weapons seemed pretty balanced for the most part. Damage is based off of the bullet type you are using and damage reduction is simply enough based off the level of armor you have.5 high risk high reward. now some people may think why should i have to risk losing a squad member or risk dying to get the gear i need. that's just the beauty of these types of game. if you want to make it to top 10 then you need to decide I'm going to loot for 20 30 minutes in a low pop area and I might get good gear? or am I going to drop high pop and ""may"" lose a guy in squad but get 3 guys fully tiered out. I say may because if your squad is good enough you can definitely come out on top by sticking together. Cons 1 server lag/instability/game performance (this covers all spectrums of the game from bullet registration delayed looting glitches FPS drops/optimization)2 I don't mind purchasable objects within a game. If you want to drop over $100 on a miniskirt. That's on you my friend. I had my time with CSGO crates and i'm done with that life. Personally I think the system is fine but there needs to be tweaks. In order to balance the system they need to give all players a default clothing item per map. For instance the current map gives a slight advantage to players wearing dark clothing/camo gear.TLDR I recommend this game if they fix the stability issues. I can deal with number 2 on my cons list because even if some people have enough money to purchase a million crates and get the cosmetics they like the ones that make a difference on the map are still fairly cheap on the community market. I myself bought a dark tshirt and camo pants for less than a dollar so can't really say a kid with the game can't do the same and sell a couple of crates to buy what he wants.On top of that it doesn't matter what you wear if you can't aim. You can be a tree in the woods but if you can't move your roots you can't dodge a bullet.""If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball.""",Recommended
spicy game chinese hackers have decreased imo,Recommended
Bullets hit people unlike in H1Z1 (Edit Before 2 million Chiners),Recommended
its alright,Recommended
The pan is mightier than the sword,Recommended
good game which can feel exciting,Recommended
"I LOVE THIS GAME !!! People complaining are some greedy mofos ! The game is in EARLY ACCESS !! It's normal to have some bugs and lacks of optimisation... I play on low setting at 60 70fps (with some drop of course) with a freakin laptop with 8gb of ram and a 970m... If lag is too much for you may be your PC is complete crap ?? ) So basically if you're not ready to play an ""incomplete"" game just wait for its complete release and pay 70$ ) Otherwise pay 35$ right now and enjoy !Thumbs up to the devs who are constantly improving the game !",Recommended
One of the best games of my generation. This game will make your emotions go from 1 100 in seconds and every sense in your body will be tested while playing this game.,Recommended
this fgame is ing amazing buy plz,Recommended
ITS A GOOD GAME AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A ABOVE DECENT COMPUTER SINCE ITS BADLY OPTIMIZED.,Recommended
i hate that i love this game,Recommended
Good Game,Recommended
My favorite camping simulator. Nothing better than pitching a tent indoors and defending it from other campers. Occasionally you have to pack up site and move it 30 seconds closer to other campers but for the most part they dont bother you untill your the only other camper remaining.,Recommended
Bought the game from recommendations from colleagues. Usually I am reluctant to spend over 10 on an early access game. But I do not regret this one bit!Althought there are a few bugs here and there this is to be expected when you are playing early access and it does not affect how much I enjoy this game. Whether you are scouting out enemies looting houses or scrambling to get into a safe zone there is never a boring moment. As the game continues getting support and updates I can really see this becoming one of my favourite games on PC of the year in terms of value for money and pure enjoyment. This game deserves support and I highly recommend purchasing!To summarise if you want a fun multiplayer game get this.,Recommended
First of all Don't listen to all these people disliking this game.It's the best early access game I've seen so far and the development speed is spectacular. Its RNG based but skill can get you out of situations where RNG is not on your side. Anyways its a great game and if you want to test your surrival military tactics this is it! 10/10 regarding the early access state. Straight and simple like that it's a must buy for shooter fans.See you on the battlefield ),Recommended
This game makes me Cream every time I play it,Recommended
Very good and addictive game,Recommended
Very addicting game people hate on it but love when they win.,Recommended
Product received for free. Always remember that no matter what your friends have better accuracy when shooting at YOU than they have at shootin your enemies. Great game nonetheless,Recommended
First time soloqued someone told me he was friendly. Turned my back and got killed. Never trust fellow player evermore in this game. Soloing isn't that much fun in my opinion but when you play with friends this game really is good.,Recommended
Nice game but the fps and cheaters make it difficult to play.,Recommended
D,Recommended
Very exciting game!If it comes to shoting sometimes the bullets doesnt go as it suposed to at all. The netcode is still in progres.Worth my money anyway//edit 03.10.2017 game is unplayable 1080ti o.c.ed + 7700k on 4.9hz and i got frame drop to 50 fps inside a house in a close fight.(fpp) Makes no sense if the game will go like this i want my money back!//edit 29.12.2017 Game is finally done how it is suposed to be not laggy fps doesnt drop that bad but still feel some lags. New map is way better than the old one Good job PUBG,Recommended
Almost everything I'd want in a shooter is in this game. If you'd like something with a bit more strategy than your average shooter like Call of Duty or Battlefield this is it right here. Not only does the game have some realism to it such as Bullet drop but the replay value to it is what really sells me on it. People will downvote this game because of cheaters and the number of Chinese people that play it (yes i'm not joking) but PUBG is currently working on fixing the hacker situation. The game will be put into Full release soon and It amazes me that this game is quite stable while it's still in development. The only cons I would have to say about this game are the hackers that have come with it since Fall 2017 as well as optimization. Granted I have 300 hours and this review may be a little biased but it's a really good game. I would highly recommend getting this game and playing it with freinds.,Recommended

This game is fantastic! Even after short breaks between games (weeks sometimes) the adrenaline rush is still there! Sure some people are way better than you what do you expect? It's technically still ALPHA and there will be lag time glitches hackers and other BS. As an Early Access Game not yet complete this game is a RIOT!!! Cannot wait for this game to go full release. Also yes they had in game clothing/skin packs optional for purchase. Give me a break people will spend money companies will take advantage of it why is this so suprising? Keep up the great work!!!,Recommended
Great game. More fun when playing duo or squad.So huge +1!,Recommended

Its a real good game bros,Recommended
whenever i click client updates or product updates it doesnt do anything? where can i see the updates rundown at??,Recommended

If you love long range kills or close quarters combat this is the game for you! it has excellent weapons and they are all fairly balanced. The mape is beautiful. I recommend this game to anyone,Recommended

gud game,Recommended
love it if the full version be better,Recommended
Even with the code issues I keep coming back for more and more and more and more......,Recommended
you can lose hours in here. absolutely loving the game though besides the lost time!,Recommended
The gameplay is pretty fun.The problem with this game is the optimisation sucks so don't expect high fps.If you have a weak setup be prepared to play on low setting with 30 fps. The gameplay is what counts with this game.,Recommended
Free for all one of only a few games that actually gets my pulse racing when your about to win.,Recommended
The Game has its flaws but keeps you coming back for more. You will rage. You will Laugh. You will call BS. You will have the $ % scared out of you and you will go back for more.,Recommended
this game is really good and i love it alot but the only problom in this game make me mad all the time bacuse of the hackers and i hope blue hole will fix it,Recommended
Enjoyable if you wanna play solo don't buy it its better with friends,Recommended
This game is a fun game to play alone or with friends. Although it does have network problems lag and rubberbanding the game is still much fun to play. The gun mechanics in this battle royal are much better than in h1z1. Right now it is early access alpha so they are working things out. I think the reason why it is so laggy is because of the amount of players daily with this south korean corporation is that they have never really had this many players to deal with so the servers are going on maximum. If u like the style of battle royal and 3rd person shooters then this game is for u!,Recommended
Very great game but it has a lot of bugs. if you are planning on doing streams or recording it i dont recomend it much because OBS and the game dont run horribly smooth together. Best of luck though definately worth a shot,Recommended
I'm here for the steam thing fun game tho,Recommended
Quite simply the most fun I've had in a game in years.,Recommended
what to say one more round ?,Recommended
5-May,Recommended
Fun specially with friends,Recommended
I feel like this game deserves all the positive ratings it can get don't let those few negative reviews drag this game down.Hands down the best battle royale experience available on steam at the moment. Perfect map size weapon variety great shooting mechanics and you can't just jump out of moving cars without dying (*cough* H1Z1 *cough*)This game does have a couple of downsides the major two being server stability and lack of optimisation. Luckily neither of these are game breaking and you're still able to enjoy the game completely through these flaws. Servers have become less of a problem through the latest patch and I'm sure many patches to come. Optimisation will be fixed very shortly (April 14th according to the dev roadmap) and I can still run the game 50 60 fps on low settings 1080p (GTX 960M 4GB). After this game has been optimised it will be even better and I can't wait to see what this game delivers. It has huge potential and we just have to hope the devs don't it up like H1Z1.ONE WARNING TO AUSTRALIAN PLAYERS I'VE FOUND THE OCEANIC SERVER TO BE MORE LAGGY THAN THE ASIAN SERVER FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON I DON'T KNOW WHAT DIFFERENCE THIS MAKES JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD ADD IT.,Recommended
best game out got a gaming computer just for this!,Recommended
tete,Recommended
Niceeeeeee,Recommended
good game,Recommended
Had a lot of fun playing it!This game is awesome to play with friends even alone.I'm not gonna judge the game just for it's optimization NO!Sure the optimization is terrible but hey guys it's an early access it's alpha version!I'm sure the game is gonna get a lot better trough time.And yeah buy the game is my opinion and DON'T if you don't have a great PC.At least for now.,Recommended

An exception to my Early Access expierences. PUB is an exceptional game. The shrinking circles that force plays to a specific section of the map is a simple yet fantastic idea. The scrounging abilities are awesome as well. Granted half the things I pick up I never use but if I do manage to find a better weapon that fits whatever attachments I pick up I'm always happily surprised. If you wanted DayZ to be a better game this is it I feel like minus the Zombies of course. I can't wait to see where the team takes this game.,Recommended
This was my first ever FPS and I'm hooked. The agony of defeat and thrill of winning keeps me coming back.,Recommended
Would hear CHINA IS NUMBER ONE again. 10/10,Recommended
Although I'm pretty bad at this game and have only won twice it was totally worth it. A few issues with connections and freezing mid game but those happen rarely. And unlike fornite you really have to work for your victories meanwhile people are posting on Snapchat every 5 seconds about winning fornite.,Recommended

Fun,Recommended
This game is worth to buy in spite of the lag problem.I have played this game for a month and I can see that the team is working to make this game getting better they have fixed lot of the problems to let this game be more interesting.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS IS WORTH TO BUY AND GETTING BETTER DAY BY DAY.,Recommended

Fun to play with you're friends. Kinda frustrating in the begining took me a while to start getting the hang of everything but thats proabbly cause i suck.,Recommended
I have put in over 130 hours odd. I have to say for an early access game it so much. Of course it has its issues but what game don't these days Great team play and amazing solo play. Make sure you don't have a heart condition when you play as the tension gets really high.,Recommended

Fantastic game even more that its early access game love it. but i do think the recoil on weapons is outrageous but cant complain its overall a fantastic game and when its fully released i think it will be even better keep up the good work,Recommended
so after 200+hrs into this game i think its time to write an honest review 180 or so hours have been in the eu server after the amount of inconsitency's with bullet reg damage etc i decided to try N/A and SA servers the difference is unbelievable on both servers the responsiveness just feels all there bullet reg is 1000x better and i cant seem to figure out why that would be. doing research it shows eu servers have a very low tick rate.. and by very low we are talking 20ticks.. for a game that wants a competetive route that is diabolical NA and SA servers have around the 30 mark and the difference is day and night.. yeah sure its early access and all but instead of devs prioritising new maps and new weapons they should be focussed on the infrastructure within the servers and give it a good overhaul im sure many of you in the eu know what im talking about bullets seem to just miss even on people not moving. before 'git gud' kicks in try for your selfs. im near on finding it impossible to hold a 1.4k/d on eu servers yet N/A 3+ and SA 3+ K/D i really do love this game but the more i play it the more i realise the amount of that isnt being the number one priority for being sorted is near the back of the list it seems whilst i do recommend this game i dont recommend playing on eu servers and as for the RNG in this game it seems to be getting worse i can loot 8+ Houses and come away with no vest a level one helmet and if im lucky a double barrel yet the next house with have 2AK'S with 120 bullets an m16 and a ump all in the same house after the loot nerf this game has become more frustrating than ever it needs a rebalance and an even spread of weapons. as time goes on with this game i do feel like the servers for the eu are getting even worse from first playing the game to the last big update they released i had won 10+ games in solo. since then not even a wiff of a chicken dinner and its disapointing. maybe im just getting worse as the game goes on or the game its self is. again if youre in the eu and you purchase this game please dont play eu servers theyre terrible. just to add my internet is by far superior enough to play my own regions servers let alone across the ponds one so dont come saying internet etc when clearly it isnt..,Recommended

Great experience my favorite part is when the download speed goes up and then down and then up. The ending is pretty predictable though from what I've heard after watching 12GB you'd expect there to be a grand finale but it just kind of says it's done downloading. I'd love to see what the actual game is like but I've never been able to download the entire thing and then come back the next day to play. There's just always another 12GB update. If you consider it DLC then there's endless daily DLC.,Recommended

Worked like a champ out of the box (so to speak) Only time I really see an issue is when there's tons of people in combat in front of me. Game runs nice gunplay is nice Overall same as your everyday survival/battle royale game. Decent weapon selection avg amount of bugs for early access. Vehicles can be derpy sometimes but hey pick your poison. Haven't really had any other complaints about this game so far.,Recommended
I F******* hate this game,Recommended
Instead of fixing the bugs and hacks PUBG banned players and added in game purchases for cosmetics. In the short run the hackers would just buy a new copy of the game and kept on hacking therfore the company makes more money. In the long run after 1yr of the game's release the game gone from the fastest growing and hottest game on steam to mostly negative reviews and losing near 50% of it's player base. Leaving a posative review but PUBG Corp y'all dumb!,Recommended

This game has the possiblity to be a great game... BUT they have done nothing recently to fix stabilization as of late... Servers are getting to be terrible with ungodly dsync and issues all around. You've made SO much money fix your sh t already!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You're killing your own game! We are all tired of it.,Recommended
This game has a unique style of gameplay that even though youre gonna lose alot it makes you keep playing. It does have its bugs right now but its in early access so its acceptable besides it is still very functional. I can play probably 3 games until i get bored but if you i have a few friend its makes the that much better. Make sure you also have good wi fi and at least a decent computer/laptop because even for me i wait at least 30 seconds to a minute for my textures to load which makes me not able to enter any building. Other than that i have barely any lag in game. Other than all that the game is totally worth the cost of $30.,Recommended
Been a console player for over a decade and recently bought a high end PC just because of PUBG. Far more intense than any other game I've ever played.,Recommended
"Game is very fun. More fun with friends that you can talk to using Discord or another chat service. Remember this is still early access so for those wondering yes there is server lag yes they are still working on bugs and yes you will encouter other problems. It takes a bit to get used to bullet travel (best) loot areas watching your own back in solo and vehicle spawns.The only issue I'll have to agree with all these not recommended reviews is the streamer snipes. Many people are getting banned ""stream sniping"" yet most people don't even watch twitch especially streamers who are bad just placing blame for the sake of their rep with watchers. Once this issue gets fixed between the developers and their players I won't really have anything negative to say as of now.",Recommended

I have played PUBG since about 3 4 weeks after its release since then the game has honestly improved by quite a bit. At the start the servers were going down every few days. Over time though they really improved the servers and for about a month now I haven't dc'd from a match.The game also gets regular updates to improve and add new guns to the game. They have also been constantly improving performance.Now concerning cheaters. I personally haven't yet seen a cheater in the game (I know I'm probably in the minority considering all the reviews I have seen). However I'm pretty confident in the devs to fix the issue. So far they have mostly delivered on their promises so I see this problem with the cheaters to be handled as well.,Recommended
God game,Recommended
In BATTLEGROUNDS you have servers where you can go Solo or find a teammate(s) in Duo and SQUAD just like in H1Z1. Unlike in H1Z1 but like in Arma 3 if you team in Solo servers you will get banned. PUBG also has Mod support for custom servers. Sadly this Mod support won t be available until full release (when it gets out of Early Access 6 month from now). Mod support H1Z1 doesn t have that. Mod support where you can create your own Battle Royale game mode (and publish it to the Steam Workshop) host it (maybe rent a server like in the Battlefield series) and have your own community or group of friends play it. .net,Recommended
Good game. Way better than H1Z1 King of the Kill. A bit buggy at the moment but i'm sure updates will fix this. Can't wait to see this game fully optimized.,Recommended
"Think of this as a mixed review becaue the game mostly plays fine but.. Guns handle nice the movement feels clunky. Looting sucks unless you use the inventory menu to loot. (PUBG mobile has a better looting menu it's kinda sad lmfao) Driving feels like driving a bathtub on wheels with a 1 second input delay when turning. The camera for riding in cars is awful and when trying to shoot people while riding in a car might as well be considered torture.As for the preformance it's kinda hard to say the game runs badly as of writing this review (on low settings at least). No more FPS drops when landing from what I can tell. You still need an SSD if you want to reliably load in. Also since #ReigonLockChina is still being spammed I personally haven't encountered any chinese players either since the recent ""achievements"" patch. It seems that they've actually implemented a ping limiter or some other thing. So people with high ping miiiight be matched with foreign players now. Though I can't confirm this without playing more. It's tough to recommend a game where in my 27ish hours I've encounterd 2 cheaters already. One was from China (locked on my head all the way from Po i through walls and buildings. I was in another town) and the other was from NA (being less blatent but still shot me through terrain).The microtransactions don't matter. People and moan about them but they're one of least disgusting implementations of ""lootboxes"" I've seen. Sure they focus on microtransactions instead of fixing their game but Overwatch is doing just fine doing the same thing )In conclusion I'd rather play this than Fortnite so it's got that going for it. It'll probably get better but until 2.0 (if this game lives that long) you should wait.",Recommended

I loved this game initially until they gave us the death cam and I could see how many hackers were wasting my time.

I've been waiting for PUBG Corp to do a move and it finaly happend. Now newcomers who are willing to buy or just bought PUBG. Let me tell you about this game you will either love it hate it or both read this This is the first battleroyale game I've played I had no idea what to expect but after few matches I got used to the concept and I must say I loved the game mechanics it's not fast paced as other battleroyales it's tactical and slow which makes it easy to adapt. It had and still has glitches but trust me you will most likely laugh than get mad. Does it run smooth? Yes for good and potato builds because I played it on both and believe it or not I had to tweak few settings on a laptop that had a GTX950m and it did run on a stable 50fps with low/med and even high graphics so I don't understand the lies about the graphical settings part? This is not a free game but let me tell you something I bought so many games because of it ( Yes you had to buy it for 30$ but it gave you more than 30$ in return ) You play get a crate and sell it ez money.You open the crate and get lucky enough for a rare skin? ez 100$. Do not play it alone it's much fun with friends otherwise you will get paired with Chineese players I am not saying they are bad but most of them are cheaters and I wouldn't want to get carried to a chicken dinner by a cheater. DO NOT AiM for winning in this game because come on 100 players and one winner? Just play for fun until the last moment. Because the hype dissapears after your first Chicken dinner. The only thing I hate about this game? Updates because I have potato net otherwise it's fun. Give it a try and there's always a refund botton as long as you don't pass 2hours ),Recommended

This game is kind of a double edged sword for me. On one hand it's rewarding and very fun with friends. On the other hand it's still broken and has to compete with Fortnite which is free and more casual. What PUBG does have over the competition however is thrill. The moment you see an enemy is a heart stopping one. PUBG takes major skill and patience. I still haven't won a game 20 hours in but I still go back to it knowing I can get better. PUBG offers an experience unlike many. It's because of that that I recommend this game.,Recommended

Awesome game!!! would suggest to everyone!,Recommended
Despite all the cheaters and the optimization it is still one of the best and addicting game out there.,Recommended
addicting game?,Recommended
good,Recommended
Review after 180+h of gameplay (Pre release)Cons Optimization is bad (please fix asap or atleast before the final release) client and server side performance is unstable and it's common to get low fps and to experience network lag when picking up items interacting with objects ... Sometimes it can be buggy (vehicles exploding randomly mostly) but it got much better with time. Some people are complaining about cheaters even if I haven't found one yet. Anyways the devs are going to improve the anti cheat system apparently so just wait It's now full of cheaters please make the Anticheat better. Even if the cheaters are noobs and can be killed (when they play from china with an high ping) it's very unlikely to defeat them and they ruin a perfectly played 30min game in 1 second.Pros Very dynamic gameplay the transition between a calm situation and an intense firefight is very quick. Variety of choices you can play it how you want. For example you can be very careful and follow the zone to keep your back covered or you can rush in and defend your position from others. Also the looting and late game strategies are probably going to influence your game the most. Non forgiving game this is the reason why it's defined as a competitive game. First of all the aim is important but it's not the only must have. The most important skill is being able to take decisions that offer the best reward/risk ratio the decisions that are going to bring you to the final circles. There you'll also have to get as much information as possible to spot your enemies and avoid being engaged from behind. Since the new update you also have to run away from the circle as fast as you can because staying outside is not an option anymore. Well made damage system the time to kill is decent as it's not too fast and not too slow. Even the most powerful weapons won't one shot armored enemies if not in the head. Since headshots are hard to master most of the times you'll have enough time to react at range. In CQC the story is different because shotguns and SMGs are going to take out enemies faster than ARs if properly used. Encourages teamwork going alone in duo/squad games is a suicide. Staying together is the only way to prevent getting killed when injured. At the same time the team must be fast enough to get as much loot as possible and stay inside the zone. Firefights are quite long when it's about taking out 4 enemies and revive your team so the time is the enemy number one. Getting downed in the final circles is very likely to kill you because the circle isn't going to forgive your mistakes.In the end this game has got many problems but I hope they're going to be fixed soon. Now the team is also producing new content to expand the game.I really like this game and if played with the right people it's the one of the best ways to have some action. I also find myself much more relaxed and I feel like I'm enjoying this game more than csgo a game on which I spend 700h. Winning on this game is a great feeling because it happens only if 1) You're a bit lucky 2) all your choices during the game were correct and made you stand over the other players.,Recommended

Alas another cheater im not surprised because its not rare to me its now common really turns me off to play the game and gets me worked up to even care to write a negative review. I recommend this for cheaters to see who cheats are better. If someone who works at Bluehole read this far I commend you and thanking for caring to read through my rant anyways if you guys haven't thought about it try having a system that monitors usernames people create because cheaters I meet names are usually numbers and random letters that does not signify anything. Not even roman or greek words or any other languages before those eras.,Recommended

Game crashes. Loading screen simulator 2017. (In all seriousness don't play this game solo. It's balls. Play with friends on drunk night. Maybe worth $10 15 but it's got some nobody's name on it so now it's name brand),Recommended
This game is good. But it needs to improve the optimization. If a good Graphics Optimize happens in near future. It will become more popular among players. Fix the game bugs and create a Good anti cheat.,Recommended
Crazy,Recommended
good game,Recommended
Very buggy and rough around the edges but brimming with potential. PUBG definitely points toward the future of the online FPS game and everything else in this category feels dated. Lots of fun with friends make sure you use a microphone.,Recommended
I've been getting bored of the game but from what I've heard they're going to keep updating the game and adding content even after the game comes out of early access. There's also a new map coming soon so that will mix things up. The gameplay is good but this game really shines when you play with friends and that's really the only reason I still play it anymore. There are things that need to be worked on such as optimization and netcode but those things can be fixed.,Recommended
Its a great game although still bugged even now we are on V1. I am still showing player N/A and cant earn BP.,Recommended
This game lacks polish and continues to feel like an alpha release. The devs seem more focused on the cash grab opportunities of developing this game for console and mobile rather than to focus their efforts on creating a high quality game.That said I still play it often and likely will continue to do so until something better comes along. What makes this game appealing to me is the gun play. It feels more realistic than arcady which is something I value highly. I just wish I didn't have to deal with the lag the crashes the bugs the poorly balanced loot tables and the slow development cycle. This game could be so much better but the devs here have only shown that they aren't capable of making it so.,Recommended
Best !,Recommended
Nice game,Recommended
Great game. It still need some bug fixing but i love it.,Recommended

Terrible optimization but still the best.,Recommended
Its a awesome game but it still has a long way to go.. the lagg is crazy sometimes.. also sometimes you play your rank 6.. and then.. an error accured.. right.. great.. lol.. so the game i tink is really good but still has a long way to go to make it run propperly.. i give it a 6 so far cause of the many bugs,Recommended
THIS GAME IS SO GRERAT,Recommended
really addictive game play always different every time you play A+++,Recommended
If Dayz and H1Z1 made love Battlegrounds would be the baby....if the baby was smarter more fun and overall better than its parents. I love this game. You get the satisfaction of the shooting in dayz with the fast pace and fun last man concept of H1Z1 except without being a glitchy game. It does require optimization and definitely has its bugs but man is this game addicting. This game is the future of battle royal games. I really hope they introduce a separate survival game because that would be amazing!,Recommended
The best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I love it,Recommended
I hate this game 10/10,Recommended
Nice game the bugG*PubG,Recommended
Probably the best game I ever played and yes I have played Roblox. So strategic and fun I have like 210 hours on the game and don't regret one of those hours. Winning is hard but soooo awesome when you finally do. I strongly recomend playing this game cuz it's just so good!,Recommended
its nice i guess,Recommended
This game is good very good but its very laggy. /),Recommended
good game and chilling game like a gta v online before shark cards come but please fix the lag and the server,Recommended
So entertaining if not frustrating at times... Drop the settings for a smoother ride and get used to your blood pumping like you've never experienced. Haven't played H1Z1 but it's effectively modded sandbox Arma but with all the t cut out and guarenteed firefights!,Recommended
Yes there may be a lot of bugs and glitches but it does not change the fact that it is a well made battle royale game that has caught millions of people's attention. The combat is intense skills tactics they are all qualities you need for this game. These are the aspects gamers look for in a game. I believe this game can go far in the future with all the new upcoming updates. Its just a matter of waiting D,Recommended
Can't get rid of hackers.,Recommended
I mean I gotta admit I didn't think I'd like this game. I'm not a huge fan of battle royale combat but the gunplay feels great and the game is nice and tight where it counts. There's definitely some issues but it's mostly due to the game being in early access. Don't fret though it doesn't look like Bluehole intends on turning this into the next ARK. They've been releasing optimization patches constantly for a while now.It's going to run like crap on most PCs but the game is damn fun and definitely worth a shot. Just don't expect the cleanest experience.E 8/1/17 Please don't let the jackasses downvoting this turn you off. It's still 100% fun it's still great people just like to complain about things that really just don't matter in the long run.,Recommended

ok??,Recommended
This is a good game. Don't like it don't get it. It is just fun intence action packed suspencful and my favourite game. Stop complaining about the bugs they arent that bad. My two 1 is my network lag and the optimisation. The network lag they can't really control and I have bad internet anyways so its probably just me. The bad optimisation makes me remember something very important... THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME. PUBG is an incredible game and even more incredible with friends and because of that I highly recomend it but am warning you &gt YOU NEED A PRETTY SPICY COMPUTER TO RUN THIS WELL WITH HIGH QUALITY GRAPHICS,Recommended
Hey remember us? we are the original buyers. We paid $30. We are not paying 10 more.,Recommended

I just ....,Recommended
Game is amazing. Lots of fun. As far as the people complaining about lag spikes and fps drops. The game is still in EARLY ACCESS and the game is nowhere near complete. Yes they maybe adding crates and paid keys right now but these do not affect the gameplay. They are only cosmetic items and if they want to add them let them. Does not mean you need to buy into the keys. Microtransactions is just a way for a game to keep the servers up and the developing to continue on. I experience very few problems with lag or fps drops but I also have played many early access games and expect there to be problems until the game is fully released.,Recommended
This game is a must own for any pc gamer. It is an instant classic. It definitely has issues. There is no doubting it. Probably more bugs than any game I have ever played personally. But they don't eliminate the hours of fun possible in this game.,Recommended
Pretty fun.,Recommended

PUBG is such a great game I don't even know where to start. Maybe it's the heart pounding action or the cruelness of this game that I love I don't know. What I do know is that this game is incredible.,Recommended
Easy review its fast its fun its a very addictive game. What i love most about battlegrounds is playing with friends having great times and good laughs you meet some crazy white boy chasing you with a sickle screaming that he is going to purge you or some damn right funny kills. its great to kill time (literally) in games in a matter of minutes getting closer to first place keeps you coming back for more.. yes it has bugs yes you sometimes get frustrated but the devs so far have been great 8/10 and only because im a content who expects all content in days ),Recommended
better than h1z1 thats for sure,Recommended
"""Blatant cheating is rewarded."" p33k b00",Recommended
Its a really great game...,Recommended
"Great Battle Royale type of game in its own right (my favorite of the genre much better combat network code than H1Z1 and very reminiscent of the Arma 3 mod but with faster load times). In that right I highly recommend.However I am not going to recommend this is game (thumbs up) as there does not appear to be any anti cheat code in the game at all. By the time you get to the top ten survivors the cheating becomes rediculously obvious (spin around and 1 shot kill or folks knowing your exact location etc) just watch a few YouTube videos of the hacking in this game. The folks at the top of the leaderboards have over %50 win rates... meaning that they win more than every other game... not really possible in this type of game... Update/Edit August 2017 I changed my review to ""recommend"" as there does seem to be a very strong effort going on to stop the cheating. I've seen very little cheating lately. The only real frustration lately is that the end game circle is a bit too random and often gives an unfair advantage to whoever happens to be left in it The circle should be determined via interpolation (average/mid point of player locations) to bring players closer and closer together.One small other thing... the map does not offer much cover in most areas the fields to the east of Gatka are incredibly good to fight in with bushes trenches uneven terrain and such however this is an exception to the current map. Update/Edit March 2018 There is a reporting system for hacking that is advertised. The way it works is that when people get killed they can click to report the person who killed them. A short time after winning just over a hundred games I received a notification when I logged into Steam stating that I was received a temporary one day ban from this game based on unconfirmed suspicions of hacking. I don't hack... I just play with stealth till the very end (I take a lot of screenshots and have very few kills). What this means is that unhappy players ""rage report"" after they lose a game.... hence betters players accumulate reports. This happened to me. So apparently at the current time the more one plays this game one will naturally accumulate reports from unhappy players. I guess an algorythm is setup to ban folks when a certain limit is hit. This is not a very good system. I used to be hopeful when the developer advertised that they banned such and such number of hackers in such and such amount of time (I despise hackers). Now as a victim of the system I know how the system works. It seems like just a marketing thing rather than an intelligent system.If the developers ever decide to actually combat real hackers and not do this broad spectrum appoach that occasionally hurts normal players they might consider region locking the game such that regions with large amounts of actual hackers can't play outside of their own region. I'll try to remember to update my review again if that ever happens.",Recommended

Used to play this game far more a few months ago but in the last few months it's gone downhill. Hacking has been ridiculous performance has gotten pretty terrible and every game I play I'm battling desync. But despite these recent issues I have faith it'll get back to a strong status and is a solid game.,Recommended
This is my first battle royal game and by any means i wasent sure how i was going to like the game. Well i was in for a trip. I played it with caution not knowing if i was going to ask for a refund or not and by my suprise this game is without a doubt one of the best multiplayer experiences i have ever had with a game. You get so addicted and your mood could be cheering and screaming because you received that chicken dinner or you slamming your desk because you got headshotted from god knows where. This game is an emotional rollercoaster and i would highly reccomend it.,Recommended
Really loves this game!Its little bit hard to learn in the beginning because of the pvp and looting but IF u give it some time u get the hang of it.The matches IS not the same at all! Sometimes u get ing great loot and die 5 mins later and other times u get loot and u end up killing 5 people and winning the match. I'll recommend buying the game if u have some friends playing because its way more fun playing with friends than playing solobad things i can say is The new map sucks To many hiding spots and its to BIG for 100 people. Sometimes u just walk aroud for 10 mins before u meet any enemies. It takes ALOT from ur CPU even if u have the game on low graphics. And the performance sometimes is just awful when u load in to a match it take ages and when u finally done loading the plane just started to fly over the map.8/10,Recommended

Pros + Very good graphics although the game looks a bit gray without ReShade.+ Good Physics.+ Map is pretty large and not repeating itself most of the times.+ I can't get tired of this game.Cons Game looks gray and washed out without ReShade looks a bit colorless. Servers are pretty bad sometimes.DEPENDING ON YOU THE GAME COULD BE PRETTY SCARY SOMETIMES ESPCIALLY IN SOLO QUEUES,Recommended
"Needs optimization on both client and server side. If my PC doesn't run this game smoothly most won't. This has the potential to be a very good game. The biggest issue with it right now is lag. Blood splatter is client side. Every time you hit someone with a shot they will splatter whether the hit was registered on the server side or not. Game needs to be more clear on how hits are registered. Give a hit marker like on H1Z1 if the hit actually hit. Countless times I have hit someone in the face with a shotgun and see blood splatter only to be shot by what appears to be nothing and then I die.That's fine just let me know if my shot registered or not. Giving arbitrary ""hit points"" doesn't tell a player how much they hit someone or how much life they took from a player. It just feels like a lazy way to say ""sorry you lost and we aren't telling you whether it was lag or your fault""I put a lot of hours into this game and the things that used to be cute about it are the same things that frustrate the hell out of me now. Still recommend the game. It's fun. It has a large population. It's updated often. But fix the things that matter. Don't put in a new color of a car and say poof! updates!",Recommended

There's no incentive to winning besides the rush of dopamine bragging rights and points towards buying a crate that you need to unlock using real money.You should get a key to unlock crates via winning a match.

Good game bit buggy still. But i absolutely hate the fact that the area shrinks so fast wouldnt mind if a game would last upto an hour. You dont have a lot of time to gather stuff or anything.,Recommended
Amazing game! It's a very simple concept but done really well.It's challenging and intense and even if you die you want to play another mach and another mach and another mach.It will keep you on the edge of your seat and will reward you for getting kills.It has a steep learning curve but once you get used to it it is sooo fun. The ability to play with a friend or a squad gives you a tacticalteam based game where to be affective you need to work together well with your friends. Disadvantages Controls and game mechanics are a bit weird and take a long time to get used to Servers can be glitchy at times (but usually they are good) Not optimised very well for lower end PC's I would definately recomend this game to anyone 9/10,Recommended
It's so good it tastes like chicken dinner,Recommended

PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS CLASH OF THE CHEARERS,Recommended
This game will make you suffer for the first 50 hours of gameplay.But after you surpassed that hours of gameplay im sure you have already or shortly after win a game for the first time or if before 50 hours you already won its god given talent.And a couple more hours later you will get your first 15+ kill game winner winner chicken dinner.AND IT FEELS SO GOOD.So would reccomend but for the start reccomend you playing with your friend that has played earlier than you to give you a head start on what to do where to land what to get whats good and not what works what doesnt and all of that shennanigans.So the only CON that i currently have is that you need ateleast 12 GB of ram to make the houses already fully render when you landed on the ground.8 is just not going to cut it. You will have atleast 30 45 seconds (or sometimes less depending on how many players on your match) Then after it renders you will be able to get into the house and loot (If you havent died by someone that has a better pc than you.) And the adventure goes on from there.Personally the hitreg is kinda 50/50 but it works most of the time.Its like when you are feeling it everything hits but when you are just riding everything nothing will even hit even from 1 meter away.It feels like that.So would i reccomend it? Absolutely will i have invited alot of friends to play so i dont get lonely from playing to much solo matches because solo does get boring after awhile without a switchup playing duo or squad.FPP is good still in beta but it works.9.5/10 Would reccomend,Recommended

Love it ),Recommended
First of all im a newcomer in this game or rather type of game. But I'd already have to reccomend it it is a solid game but there are a couple things to note before playing it.1.) There are alot of hackers. Alot. It gets really annoying when you get shot by a bullet that was aimed 5 feet behind you but you can report players. It's also kind of mediocre that there are 3 million active players and that 1.5 Million players have already been banned. Seriously read this article http //store.steampowered.com/news/externalpost/pcgamer/22848799495361194752.) There are alot of Asian players and i haven't been in an American server yet without any Asian players.3.) Running around. There is alot of running. Whether it be to a house or highway running away from bombs / enemies or just trying to get back inside the boundaries.4.) Play this game with a friend. It's pretty stale if you play it alone.5.) You're gonna get shot alot. And if you're new to this style of FFA you're gonna get shot from people you couldn't see in the distance.This game is fun though. If you like games such as H1Z1 or Fortnight's battle royal its pretty much the exact same thing. This was useed to inform you guys if you buy this game which i reccomend these are things you need to look forward to.,Recommended
its pretty cool when you find good stuff and get sniped from who knows where,Recommended
When only 1 person out of 100 wins each game there tends to be a lot of rage and salt. Especially if you're bad at the game. This I suspect is the case with half the reviews who are people who make excuses for their performance. Anyways on to the review like most games especially fps games there's hackers desync issues etc. But it definitely isn't a bad game because of it. And in the long run this shouldn't make the game unenjoyable for you. I recommend it because of how strategic you have to be while playing. What I mean is how you act according to the situation that match gives you. Do you rush somebody or wait for them? Which building or hilltop do you take? What weapon or attachments? Should you take a car or go on foot? These are only a few questions out of the hundreds you'll be asking yourself (or teammates) every match. And the more you play the easier the answers will be and the more games you'll win. After over 500 hours I still enjoy it and so do the people I play it with. This game has come a long ways and unlike so many others it's getting constantly updated and improved weekly. So if you're the impatient gamer I'll tell you not to waste your time. And if you want to win everytime you won't but that's part of the game.,Recommended

As a long time player of ARMA3 Battle Royale I have said time and time again that this game mode is the single greatest multiplayer tactical shooter experience ever to be released. Now with this standalone game PLAYERUNKNOWN delivers again. The game is gorgeous the gameplay is streamlined and the execution is fantastic. Yes it is early access and yes there are still kinks to iron out. But PLAYERUNKNOWN stands as a model for all early access developers what he promises he DELIVERS. So don't skimp on the $30 price tag... skip a few starbucks runs and support a developer who believes in the community. By the time this reaches the full release date BATTLEGROUNDS will be the standard bearer for all future multiplayer tactical experience I guarantee it.,Recommended
Great Game. A good computer is needed though.,Recommended
Lots of fun!,Recommended
I cant wait for full version this game,Recommended
A fantastic game to play with friends. Has its issues but it should be vastly improved with the upcoming patch in December,Recommended
Very good game just needs RSA servers!,Recommended
Product received for free. Da best open world game!!!,Recommended
Buy it or don't I don't care I just want the badge.,Recommended
I really enjoy this game its great fun and even better playing alongside a couple of people. The optimization could be better but it is early access so to be expected. As for those babies whining about microtransactions Ignore them. That is only for some cosmetic things (i.e Clothing) that has absolutely nothing to do with the core game (and basically gets swapped out for a game when you pick up a helmet for example. People are just crying and whining because well they haven't got anything else to do POverall I'd say try to find out if you PC can run it smoothly If so go for it. It's great fun and I've had a few good bad and just plain hilarious games!If not then just wait for it and keep your eye out for any mention of optomisation for graphics. Getting a decent fps is paramount to getting that chicken dinner!,Recommended
cant wait for final release on both PC and XBox,Recommended
BEST KIND OF GAME I can run it with low spec pc. Hopefully they fully optomize the game D,Recommended
Can I run the game properly with a 1060 and 8gigs of RAM? no. Do I love this game? yes.Please Blue Balls fix the ing game! I want to stream it! CAUSE ITS GOOD OTHERWISE!!!,Recommended
After the recent update the game became much more playable no more server lags as well as fps drops were fixed. Very entertaining to play and strategic. 9/10.,Recommended

i like the game even with all bad thinks inside D still better than sims fortnite ),Recommended

Really a good game. Every match you play is a different struggle to be the last one alive. This is without a doubt one of the best games I have played this year infact to date maybe. Really excited to see where this game is going with future patches etc since its still an EA release. 10/10 Spoil yourself P Only thing we need now is South African servers &gt .&gt,Recommended
A very enjoyable game. It has a few issues but overall it is one of my favorites.,Recommended
I lyk hunger games,Recommended
After initial problems the game now performs decently. Lots of potential but mid game needs some work because after intense start it is just boring until the circle gets to less than 1km in diameter. Developer should also try to minimize random things like first circle.,Recommended
Awesome game with awesome team still working on it. This game got nutts! And will be number 1 in this kind of game! Just buy it!,Recommended

Better than fortnite,Recommended
It's my favourtie GAME best game ever buy it,Recommended
Been playing since Alpha paid access and I can honestly say that if you're looking for a good battle royal this game is by far the magnum opus in the genre.Last few updates have smoothed the framerate and the overall gameplay let's hope the devs keep this course!,Recommended
Optimize it,Recommended

Lots of greatness to this game. It's far from perfect but the most fun I've had in a multiplayer in quite a while.Primarily because it has a legit solo mode. You can play by yourself and it all depends on you or play with a group and have a blast.,Recommended

Pros Devs really optimized the game since I purchased the game (3 Jul 2017) back then I couldn't even properly shoot due to random fps drops Really fun to play squad with friends Almost no waiting for a match after you press ready you are instantly loading into a new match with other 90+ players New features added like deathcam so you can actually see why you died Recently ReShade has been banned from this game so no more filthy cheaters....Cons ...but chinese cheaters are still a thing I love getting killed with headshot from s12k from 400m away (with no aiming) note its just small example in most cases player's crosshair simply snaps back and forth to your head or your body even if that person is not even aiming at you Even if I said optimization is way better than it was in early access it still could be improved especially in squad mode.,Recommended
Extreemly fun with a group of friends with the same mind set. Few hackers that I've personally witnessed to date. The optimization of the game should be a priority at this point. the rendering seems to be a big issue with me when first landing after a airplane drop.,Recommended
Pretty good game bruh. Worth every cent.,Recommended
Its an amazing game tons of fun alone or with friends But I feel that devs are WAY to brutal with bans for teamkilling and voice chat. A good friend of mine team killed me as a joke and he ended up getting perma banned with no way to get his game back without buying another copy.,Recommended
1AM Just one more match before i go to sleep.7AM O D D T_TWent to work sleepless totally worth it great game.,Recommended

PUBG is an excellent game gameplay wise. I really like the premise the shooting the looting the searching pretty much everything. Maybe a few balance tweaks and it's golden again gameplay wise. Its major flaw is the countless bugs someone can encounter although they have been getting fixed quite in a slow pace. All in all i really love it and it absolutely takes the experience of playing with friends to another level.,Recommended

better than h1z1 KOTK,Recommended
Simple Idea LandLootStay in the zone as much as possible (Stay away from the blue)KillIn all honesty this is a really fun game. The game is way better when you squad up with friends. I recommend.,Recommended
I have a couple hours and a few matches under my belt now and while I am far from an expert at this sort of game I think I have experience my fair share of battle royal types. Having said that this game tops all of them. Immediately. Even in EA with a few bugs (disconnects few FPS drops here and there some laggy controls when opening doors and picking things up and some lag when shooting) it is still thebest battle royal game out there. The graphics are very similar to Arma/DayZ but with unreal 4 engine they look great. Distance viewing is a little blurred and undetailed but still looks pretty good. Sound in this game is amazing. The guns sound good. The directional sound is spectacular (knowing where shots are coming from hearing where footsteps are etc). Controls are little clunky at times but pretty good compared to some others (I'm looking at you Arma...). Once the updates start rolling in and new vehicles and guns come out it will get even better. 9/10.,Recommended
if h1z1/dayz/arma had a baby,Recommended
Hey that's pretty good.,Recommended
i recommend this game but not yet if you dont like a unfinished game most people hate this game because its broken and lots of hacker or just rage but this game is EARLY ACCESS most people forget that it means anyting can happenif you dont have a problem with it its really fun to play with friends playing alone is also fun but it gets boring after a while this game is the h1z1 without t (except a few thing ofcourse),Recommended
Always land at school get rekt 7/5,Recommended
4/5 Meh. The hype of the game is a bit much to be honest. Dont get me wrong the game is exciting / fun.BUT! The area restriction times are a joke For the size of the map the restricting game area times need to be longer...much longer. It feels like im rushing the whole time. Its tagged as a survival but its just a rush and shoot. I want a longer mode.,Recommended
would raep this game 5/5 amazin gemplay,Recommended
one of the best games i played in 2017.,Recommended
Hoping they fix the game crashing and a few in game things like the floating rocks you hit the rocks and take damage! But this games very fun and addicting!,Recommended
too unstable for me**update**Seeing the devs contunie to work on the game actually makes me happy. This isn't a cash grab game at all and it will not die out for a long time. They are improving this game quite literally every day. It's an early access game but it feels like a AAA with devs that care.,Recommended
Meh game but when desert comes out. ooooo like a new game.,Recommended

Before I start I haven't personally encountered many hackers if any but I understand the concerns of other players about this and it is tragic that Bluehole is failing to act.This game has me hooked in a way few other games have managed. I have a constant drive to perform better that only CS and R6 have given me previously. I want to do better and I want to win constantly. The feeling of getting a chicken dinner is overwhelming the first time and pleasantly satisfying afterwards. The weapons are mostly well balanced (with some rifles being a bit iffy) and overall a great game if you like the idea of fighting to be the LMS.,Recommended
Battle Royale style gameplay done right. Sure theres some jank its still fun.,Recommended

55 hours and not exp a cheater yet MY pc gpu 970 gtx 4 4 mhz cpu and second is 5800 at series 3 6 mhz cpu both 8gb ramMy pc runs its almost all maxed. Second most setting all low or very low but very playable.This is my first review on steam Been fragging ppl since quake back in Dial up modem days(1995 96 ish)I hesitated to purchase this game because of all the players crying about cheating ect. I played forntite and i did have fun but since playing Pubg have not logged back into fortnite. If you grew up playing mine craft pvp and mommy still makes your bed(fornite is full of children) Since i have been playing Pubg i have yet had a child in my squad. I have yet to find a cheater(death cam and being able to watch your whole match in replay is awesome). If you are a CSS/Battlefield then this game is down your alley. The comparison from Fortnie to Pubg is like the kids ride at the carnival to the adult rides. I have had so much fun playing with my 18 year old son in my squad(except the time i shot him in the back) and my 16 year old daughter gonna try it out today. Advice to new players. DO not spawn in main towns !! Find a house and get use to gearing up and stealth exploring. I wont one of my first matches my first day i got the game yet to do it again!! And i was on a Chinese server(make sure you choose the server when you start as its default was Asian server)Do not let the talk of cheaters stop you from enjoying this amazing title Just pretend your in a real life situation and you will live much longer 10 10,Recommended
Buggy as hell frustrating annoying and addictively fun. This game can easily become one of the top titles once they get it figured out. Until then I guess I'll deal with the problems as they come (Which seems to be new ones each update) but still a fun game.,Recommended
Ban Asian IP addresses and it will elimate 100% of the aim bot hacking. Other than that its a fun game...,Recommended
PUBG the seemingly overated game taking over gaming pages/posts everywhere. It's become an overwhelmingly popular game. I thought it was too overated for me to play and was going to avoid it until the hype died down but I just had to try it. Now if you like fortnite this is 100000 times better in my opinion. It is just a battleroyale game but the mechanics optimization and overall gameplay is great. I'm still in the honeymoon phase but this game is exactly what I have been looking for to give myself a break from MMO's and Sandboxs.You'll win you'll lose.. and rage.Long story short 10/10 wud fuq and get fuqed again.,Recommended
The game has improved in the past months regarding performance issues.Alhough still encounter a glitch every time i drive a buggy glitchy flash of graphics and some places still need to be optimised on the map.We are in need of 1st person only servers as the META has changed recently and everyone is 3rd person whoring and playing like little girls only play solo squad games now to actually get any action.,Recommended

Product received for free. I like this game it still has quite a few bugs or just major server issues but I find it unique and a very fun game to play with friends once you know what you are doing. Don't buy if you want a bug free or server lag free esport quality game it just isn't that quite yet but I think it is pretty close. Other wise I would reccomend it to you if you think it would be fun and you don't care about the problems I and others have listed. I personally haven't found really anyone that I could say was actually cheating yet but it is hard to tell due to the somewhat random lag. Oh also I will say that it may be a good idea to wait for a sale in it's current state as it may not yet be worth a full 30$.I found my first cheater so yeah there must be no anti cheat in yet or at least no way to report it and obvious ways to cheat.,Recommended
Intense on solo and a great laugh to play with friends.,Recommended
"Yes the game has a good amount of bugs... that dosent make it a ""Bad"" game. The gun play (most of the time) is awesome very realistic and fun to get good at. It will continue to get better and better with each patch. Be patient and stop hating so much! Get them chicken dinnerz",Recommended

Best battle royale style game out there right now but despite that it still has its issues. It being early access this is expected. From optimization to game breaking bugs to laggy connection they've got it all. But with all of those I've managed to have a ton of fun with the game. Don't let the cons get in your way of having fun losing one game every once in a while is worth it to me. Most of the negative reviews are just people complaining about one of the many obvious issues you find in an early access game and you should expect when making the purchase. Great game if you were eying H1Z1 but never pulled the trigger.,Recommended
"I used to be an avid Rocket League player. Yeah used to be. Battlegrounds manages to capture something games like H1Z1 Fortnite and many other battle royale games are missing and that's flow. Every piece of the game works together(yeah devs still have some kinks to work out hence BETA) to lead to the satisfying end product. Whether that be a massive number of kills a most ridiculous death or a Chicken Dinner it's fun as hell. I can look beyond the ""bad"" optimization numerous bugs occasional hackers and random network lag. Millions of players enjoy this game daily and I can understand why. Some games come and go while others become genre defining.",Recommended

Really enjoy this game however the server crashes have got to be fixed. I was in the top 3 and server crashed as i approached the final circle. Still hankering for a chicken dinner and feel like i got robbed a bit. I know it is early access but if you want a thriving player base server crashes will not create longevity.In short great game $hit servers at the moment.,Recommended
Welcome to Human Hunting Looting Simulator 2017.The game is great fun and addicitve. Few problems (expected due to early access) that will be ironed out through patches. If you're looking for an exciting game to play I would highly recommend this. Buy it while its cheap as this will be a full priced game upon full retail release.,Recommended
Innovative in design and highly addictive. It's easy to get into but difficult to master.,Recommended
Fantastic game first person is superior. People who are complaining about micro transactions are just salty its literally just some cosmetic items. It does nothing they worked extremly hard to fix a broken patch and within 24 hours fixed every issue that showed up. I've never seen a Dev team go that fast before. Game does have its downsides nothing upsetting. They release two patches a month and always deliver when they state they will. 10/10 would have many chicken dinners again.,Recommended
Best game,Recommended

Without cheats 10/10. With cheaters 0/10,Recommended
Good game and has very good elements and potential to be a great award winning game. There are a few issues remaining and will be in the game for a while as it is an early access game. The game feels a lot better than a lot of games although it can be difficult to run on lower end machines. Crashes can be often but the developers are constantly working to improve the game and to add new content to keep the game fresh and keep it up to date. I recommend this game as for the price you will get your moneys worth if you enjoy shooter games and are competitive.,Recommended

100 Hour Review This is my honest review at 100 hours of gameplay Ok lets start this after 100 hours I feel like i can say something about this game take it how you feel im not going to just bash this game. This is my honest review of this game.Lets start with the postives Heres a small list of my positives will explain more after list... Great gun play Great experiences with friends and randoms The immersion when you are in a gun fightNow let me explain I love how this game plays out in gun fights you feel like you have to be dug down and really figure a good way to outplay your enemies. This provides great experience that you like to talk about with your friends .Now lets get into the negitives Heres a small list of them... Loading times if you are not on a SSD Way to many bugs that effect gameplay Communication ProblemsNow let me explain these. When it comes to the loading times on without a ssd without one it would just sit at the black loading screen and you would hear the lobby audio then you enter the plane and you would have to close the game and reopen it and by that time you were either dead or so far away from the circle you leave. Switching to a SSD fixed it for me. With the bugs I have experienced are glitching through walls not being able to pick things up. Falling through the map. When they update this game it always feels like they take one step forward to only then take to steps back. With communication problems when you solo que in duos or squads you can end up with a person who just doesnt want to work as a team or someone who doesnt speak your language. So this has been my review of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds take it how you feel I dont care this is my feelings not yours,Recommended
Intense gameplay lots of customzation big map and overall really good gameplay. Better that H1Z1.,Recommended

I have really enjoyed this game. It's a great way to relax or to play competitively. This is a game for people that want to play more competitivly and more seriously rather than what fortnite has made with its community and fan base. I see PUBG as a game to be taken a lot more seriously.It's fun with friends and also on solo as long as you make it fun. I myself have spent many hours playing with my friends and messing around. Not only that but I have spent a few hours playing with ex pro ChosenZygote (Calvin) and a few others.I've heard people say it's boring however I have to disagree it's only boring if you make it boring. Drop in a big area and try kill as many as possible make it fun. This game can become hugely more entertaining if taken seriously.With fornite recently growing massively and becoming such a popular game it's hard for PUBG to compete. My best advice to the developers is to make it free to play or at least half the price however though it really is hard for them to make these kind of changes because the community would not take it lightly with so many people paying full price for it recently. I know there are many hardcore fans out there I know some personally and know there are many more out there that should be supporting this game in its rough spot.Summary of this mess of a review is that it's a pretty good game and doesn't deserve the hate it has been getting. Good luck dev team!,Recommended
Great game but I wish the Developers spent more time making it better and less time on loot boxes,Recommended
Fun as hell even more so in duos and exponentionally so with a squad.Hackers will deff kill your vibe and the devs need to get on that asap.,Recommended
Enjoy my time playing this game lots of potential but as with all the Early Access games lots of work to be done too. I tried the recent 1.0 test server updates and I really like what they're doing the new UI is quite an improvement. I don't mind the loot being RNG but I wish they'd implement some bad luck protection in the larger towns it sucks being alone looting Rozhok or Lipovka and not finding a single AR/SR.,Recommended
Amazing concept of battle royal.,Recommended

This game is phenomenal. I have 367 Hours invested into this game. and loved most of it. When the hackers came into play. It got a little boring and repetitive. But now PUBG is really cracking down on getting rid of these heads. I've heared that the developers are not only banning the ip address. But banning their graphics card ID. I think it's pretty ingenious! I've had more fun playing this game with friends than the past games i've played. Only other game I've equally had fun is Dota 2 HoN or LoL.,Recommended
Just under 60 hours in and aboslutely love the game! The gameplay is very dynamic with minimal downtime it is still in beta so you might find a playability issue but usually with a little research on the forums you can get your game playing flawlessly.,Recommended
Great game but the anti Cheat needs work,Recommended
Cool,Recommended
Product received for free. I really enjoy the game but wish there was a level system so you can work towards to something,Recommended
Yeah,Recommended
It's gritty. It's got lots of guns. It's the most strategic in duos but probably the most fun in squads. Don't give up on it until you try playing it with friends.,Recommended

Player unknowns battlegrounds. PUBG is a gaame that will treat you like a . too slow when looting? miss blue wall's gonna slap you. suck at aiming? your toast. not ballsy enough to know when to fight? oof. the game is great imo the only problems are with the creators not working with the community. while the chinese are rampant on all the servers there should not be a reagion lock just a ping lock such as like 150+ ping gets kicked. all in all as long as you dont take the game TOO seriously right now youll have a good time. though i do think that once the game is fixed a bit more this game can be taken extremely seriously.,Recommended

very fun game 10/10,Recommended
The game at its core is brilliant and have so much potential. However i feel like its badly executed and need some optimization. Nevertheless its a fun game and can be as enjoyable as frustrating,Recommended
Fun game,Recommended
This is a good game i have almost 500 hours in the game on 2 accounts but there are still many problems with the game. The NA servers are flooded with chinese players and hackers but despite that i have had a great time playing it i do think the game will be destroyed by hackers if this problem isnt fixed. overall the devs have alot to do to fix this game but in my opinion it is worth the buy,Recommended
A day in Playerunknown's Battlegrounds I spawn with a black screen with screaming people. Suddenly loud plane noise with a annoying flight attendant (no idea whats going on). Suddenly you hear wind noise (still black screen). Apparently I am in a map somewhere. Managed to grap some stuff. Work my way up to top 10 (still no kills...duh). Got killed with a pan. 10/10 I would restart the game.,Recommended

I highly recomend the game its fun developers work with community when adding new things skins in game is acceptable only thing I did not like is optimalization. For some reason I must have everything on very low and even then I wont get over 60 FPS my notebooks parameters are aproximately twice as good as minimum requirements so I expect to run it atleast on low or medium graphics but its still playable on very low it just looks horrible.,Recommended
10/10 Died from falling,Recommended
I honestly can't say enough good things about this game. For early access I haven't basically any bugs or issues. It runs well and is stable and looks decent. The great thing is the community is pretty nice and a lot of people use mics and actually want to cooperate and work together if you're playing duo or squad. Finding full matches and starting right away is never an issue at any time in the day. With a little more optimization to keep frame rate dips it would be perfect IMO. Other games in the genre usually only get some of the pieces right but this game has the best combat system if you ask me. The second you drop it is an intense race to loot up and that feeling never dies. It is hard for me to actually get hooked on games these days and its rare for me to sit in front of a game for 5+ hours straight and this game made it easy. Easily the best 30 bucks I've spent on a game in a while!,Recommended
h1z1 done right,Recommended
Playerunknown's Battlegrounds for an early access game at this point in development of about rougly 9 months it is phenomenal! Besides the obvious bugs and required optimization tweeking this game cannot get any better. It gives you a fantastic feeling of intensity and maturity which other gives fail to give you The developer himself as stated in the game's title is great as I've had experience with both the Arma 2 and Arma 3 Battle royale mods in the past. So if you enjoy games similar to this such as H1Z1 or not I would highly recommend this game if you can run it. From what I can tell this game won't be in early access for much longer at most a year and the content seems to be being updated quickly with interaction between the dev's and the community. The game is well balanced with enough weapons to keep up the variety but not enough to be overkill. Killing other players require skill with recoil on guns bullet drop and bullet travel time which makes this a game you must play to understand and to be good at rather than another run and gun Call of Duty type of game. Character customization is also there along with weapon customization giving you the player a more adaptive experience and not a shallow one. Overall it's a fantastic game as long as the development maintains on it's course I would highly recommend you giving this game a go.,Recommended
NEED TO IPROVE THE OPTIMIZATION WHEN LOADING THE GAME EVEN THOUGH IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME THIS COULD BE A GREAT GAME AS LONG AS THEY KEEP IMPROVING AND FIXING ALL THE BUGS IT HAS,Recommended
Way better then H1Z1!!! trust me. Although there are some problems with it I bet they will fix them. My current best friend is having a trouble with the game. The problem is after around 10 mins playing the game it crashes his computers audio and then makes it un usable. So I would just play an hour after you buy it and if the same problem happens to you get a refund and go get H1Z1. Other then that issue this game is a 10/10!!! It's my new favorite game its worth the full price!,Recommended
"Although many recent reviews have condemned the constant bugs and hackers in the game this issue has ceased for me at least temporarily since I purchased the game. The bug/glitch problem is still a definite issue but usally the result of it is minor such as taking a little bit of damage when you land.I'm unsure if I'm on top of the see saw here but there is not many other negative things I can say. The game creates fantastic scenarios of Player vs Player battles with intense FPS mechanics and strategy involved. It's atleast semi realistic or competent for a battle royale something that was certainly modernized by this game. I have been playing for several months and have sailed to the top 0.5% of solo players. While I wouldn't call myself ""a god"" or anything I have racked up enough experience in Solo Duo and Squad to say that many of the issues reviewed by other players are a result of their own play. In conclusion while PubG continues to struggle with small problems in bugs and hacking it has strengthened its core since conception and continues to better itself. I have enjoyed this game continually and can't wait to play again.",Recommended
I normally don't play competitive shooters but playing this with friends is just the best. Whether you are trying to do well just goofing off or anything in between it's a great time.,Recommended
the game is cool but i am getting really on how know one has cracked down on the cheaters in this game. they think its fare but they have no skill if they are goin to cheat. they just wait there for you to come and then shoot you. I think that someone has to do something about all of this in this game.,Recommended

"Edit Jan 2018 the game has taken some major steps in the right direction and is worth the asking price now. IMO the early access was pretty rough and hopefully you didnt end up like me having it uninstalled for over 75% of the time. With that said game runs MUCH smoother the new map looks good and the new UI is actually a working UI. Gameplay has its ""WTF"" moments but they are far and few between.Original Review It's worth noting that this game has major potential. Is it worth the asking price right now? Absolutely not. The greed in developers has overcome the passion of making a polished game before releasing it. I realize there are limitations with the engine but there are major issues across the board with this game. Servers are constantly experiencing latency issues water is basically bulletproof and the ""knock down"" system is flat out bad in my opinion. Just have a player either live or die from my shots pretty simple. Fall damage is inconsistent and random (sometimes you jump off a three story building and are fine sometimes you clip a tree while parachuting and take 75% fall damage). If the asking price were in the $10 $15 range I could be more forgiving. Wake up Blue Hole.",Recommended

I really like this game i have seen videosbut helppppMy game gets stuck on the loading screen but audio keeps on playing SHOULD I GET A REFUNDPLEASE HELP,Recommended
Edit (Dec 12th) Rebought the game am enjoying my time and able to actually play the game for the most part but still laggy and buggy they are promising improvements so for the moment it seems to be a promising game if you can get past the glitching/laginess.BELOW IS A POST ABOUT A BUG EXPERIENCE ALL OF MY TIME WITH THIS GAME WAS SPENT ON THE BUG. (it was 1hour at the time I have since been able to play the game succesfully)Could not get past the loading screen it lagged as if i was attempting to run it and 50 versions of itself. I could not find any solution and customer service basically said I would have to wait days (out of my refund period) to get a possible solution. This game I am sure is fun as all of my friends are enjoying it but I can not play it due to some unknown bug. I can play any other game released in todays market my PC performs well at high settings and max on most games. So buyer beware..buggy game.,Recommended

not as good as i expect but its fun when u play this game with friends,Recommended
I have been waiting to buy this game for a long time. At last I got it and its awesme,Recommended
I think it is high time when i should write a review about this game after playing almost over 400hrs.This game overall is a very very good game and the everincreasing player base simply signifies the same.This is a game we must never forget which broke steam concurrent player records even in its early access stage.To be very right this is not the very first game which hold the crown of being first of its genre it holds the crown of first Battle royale game that is being liked and accepted everywhere so much.If I am not wrong this game is not completely released as a complete game of its standard is always a work in progress and to be correct this is a game which is out of early access.There were loads of major bugs among which very few you will encounter only if you sit to play the game having a testers mentality.Issues are there true but the developer team is working one them too.The main issue with this game right now is the numbers of hackers you might encounter if you play on AS/SEAS/OC servers.And Then Bluehole inc. and now PUBG Corp. Must understand that the game is still in very good health as players have not yet started stopping playing this game due to cheaters.....but if they dont take any drastic action any soon this game too might end up like what happened to R6 siege at some point when players stopped playing not just because the game had lots of bugs but also it had lots of cheaters/hackers.This is a very common issue nowadays hacks become available before the game itself is available to people so which clearly indicates that there are some people who are working from inside but again finding then out is also a nasty kind of job when you have got enthusiastic game developers at your disposal.Again Region lock on some country is never a solution as it will be injustice towards the non cheaters even though the numbers are very less.But there are brutal measures which can be taken against these kind of noobs(I would call them) like in other major titles like overwatch league of legends and others which ban the cheaters by their hwid i.e. Hardware Id.If the cheaters problem is properly taken care of this game will surely succeed maintaining its playerbase.Gameplawise tweaks are required and its improving so growth wont be hampered.Graphical glitches are there but hopefully will be fixed as the dev team are working on them everyday.My rating to this game is 9.1/10 as per its current state considering this as a multiplayer(which it is) game.And this is a definite buy for everyone who likes to play copetitive games.......GG everyone......This truly is Battle Royale,Recommended
Game that noone can forget to play,Recommended
every time you land ...its a new story and new adventure.,Recommended
This is one of my most favorite games I ve played. Despite currently having 2 maps I keep coming back for more. I have a steady line up of people to play with and it s almost always a great time playing with them.I understand the frustration players can have with the cheating that goes on but it seems the developers/publishers are going after the hack makers legally. I m very happy that the game is being supported not only in game but also in the real world.Give it a try or quite a few tries. That chicken dinner can be hard to obtain for some.,Recommended
First Venture into battle royale games. was sceptical about spending 30euro on an early access game but after i saw many streamers playing it i went yolo and bought it.MY GOD. the tense the adrenaline rush... Developers seem to care for the game with many updates so far. perfomance is not the best and you need to have a beastly pc to enjoy the game without sub60fps t but its one hell of enjoyment !if the game gets perfomance updates soon enough i would give it a straight 10/10for now 9.5/10,Recommended

Yeah it's fun but only worth about $20. I wouldn't pay full price for it in it's current condition. Devs have tamed quite a few bugs but there are still many game breaking bugs particularly latency issues. The hacker issue seemed to be resolved temporarily but is now a problem again. If you encounter too many hackers try switching to first person only mode. It has less hackers than 3rd person. Shame,Recommended
If you like killing people for fun this will be the game for you. Even though it is not yet released officially the game play is commendable.,Recommended
I have played this game for almost 80 hours and can say that this game is really enjoyable. The game is not perfect by any means and has a lot of room for improvement but with that being said it has a charm to it that makes me come back to play it each time. I have to agree with other people when they say that the game should be region locked not because I don't like players from other parts of the world but because It's more enjoyable when you can communicate with your squad in the same language. the game plays well altough the FPS could be better and the servers tend to crash every once in a while. other than that the game is fun and I'm looking forward to see how the game improves. I can definitely recommend to others to try it out.,Recommended
Wait For 1 year finally pubg is not early access anymoreThey Fix a lot of and i'm very Happy about that The control is quite simpleWhat I don't like about pubg after early access is when u get a crate u need to spend some money for a key to open a crateand when this game is early access the crate is free to open but nvm at least i can go to Community market to buy some costumeIt's a very nice game to play with ur friendsThere's 2 maps in this game 9.8 out of 10 after early accesss,Recommended
very nice,Recommended
"""Winner winner chicken dinner!"" i seen that once and now i cry at the end of every match because i'll never have that luck again.",Recommended
QUICK REVIEW 8/10REASONING I find this game very enjoyable obviously with a great team of 3 men. The only reason I have rated this game 8/10 however is due to the lack of english mates that i will encounter during playing squads looking for a team. It really concerns me but at the same time it pushes us players to interact with another ways such as discord to counter this issue. Overall this game is great especially after the recent updates (Higher fps for all of us!).Conclusion Overall this game is brilliant and always has this refreshing feeling every game. Keep in mind that this is my first review EVER on my time spent on steam so load up your game and start fighting to win that sweet chicken dinner ).,Recommended

This game man... Challenges your inner hate with crashes even after the v.1 update 1/3 games and totally bugs sometimes without a single reason no matter the system you have. And if thats not enough you have to deal with a bunch of chinese.But I guess its fun to play (when you actually can) with friends (which are not included with the game of course).Edit Game freezes even more now for no reason. Plz suck my balls devs. Thanks,Recommended
From a gameplay and spectator perspective PUBG generally shines. Due to the randomization in every game from the plane paths and loot distribution combined with the freedom given to players to play how they want PUBG can offer a unique experience every time allowing the player to tell their own story. Most matches payout similar to a horror movie story arch. You always get a taste of the danger in the beginning either just by seeing the other players dropping onto the map or getting in some early game gun fights. Then you get the mid game where you loot up generally with little interaction with other players but the suspense builds as the player gets more invested into the match as they loot house to house with the possibility of an enemy player around every corner ready to fight. Then comes the late game where the stakes are high as the players generally invested a lot of time into the match gathered a bunch of loot and won a few gun fights already. In late game its down to the best players in the entire 100 person lobby and is the climax of the match story arch resulting in a win for only 1 person or team. PUBG is also great as a spectator game due to the reasons as well. It is generally easy for an outsider to understand how well the player is doing in any given match thanks to the visual queues of the loot and the player counter ever ticking down. The lull in action in the middle also gives streamers a chance to interact with their audience while still playing the game. One major issue with the gameplay that has been highlighted with the release of the new larger map is that due to the borders of the game always shrinking and sometimes very quickly vehicles can be essential however the vehicle spawns are not spread out well and in general are just not frequent enough often leading to the gameplay experience for a portion of the players in any given match consisting of running from the circle cutting out most of the suspense build for those players as they can t loot or explore very much or risk succumbing to the encroaching wall which means they won t get very invested in the match. From a technical perspective the PUBG has suffered for most of its existence with terrible FPS and server reliability however these issues have been greatly improved in recent updates. The main technical issues that still exist are cheaters inaccurate death cams and poor net code. Since users can select which server they want to play on this allows a huge amount of cheaters from china to play on all servers which ruins the experience for others. The problem of cheating is also more noticeable in PUBG compared to other games thanks to the huge lobby size of 100players so only one of those 100 players needs to be a cheater in order to ruin the match as supposed to a much smaller lobby of 1 in 5 or 10 like in most other games. Most of the cheating could be mitigated if china or all countries were region locked so you could only play in your region. Region locking the game would also improve the poor net code situation as it wouldn t have to deal with such extreme ping. Currently the games net code is terrible and ranks at the bottom of the pack for similar games. PUBG s net code fluctuates between 32 updates per second all the way down to two updates per second which is not ideal for a competitive shooter. This poor net code results in items not being picked up shots not registering and also affects the death cams. Due to the games net code being so terrible the recorded death cams can appear as though the enemy is aiming nowhere near where they actually were this leads to huge amounts of false cheat reports which makes it harder for the game studio to find and remove real cheaters.,Recommended

This game is just awesome. Great concept exciting and with huge potential. YEs ocasionnaly you have the frame drop but with my GTX 970 SSC i get 60 70fps lowest i've seen is 45fps at Medium settings. Plays quite solid not a lot of options but expected as it is still alpha. I'm definitly going to put in a lot more hours on this. As they had variety i can only iamgine how awesome this game will be. Definitly recommend if you are into shooters some RPG elements and stealth lots of stealth.,Recommended
I dislike some features being used in the game but I believe things will change I give the game an 8/10 and worth the buy!,Recommended
I have over 800 hours of gameplay in DayZ. I love DayZ because of the intensity of the firefights and this game does a really really good job of giving you this experience even though the pace is much faster. It's really easy to get in to and super enjoyable. Great game.,Recommended
This game might be glitchy but the glitches are what make it funny. PUBG was hacker paradise but more hack makers have been brought to justice in PUBG than any other game because of the devs of PUBG helped the Police to aprehend them and now this game is almost hacker free. The performance isnt the best but not even Valve could do better with CS GO even though Valve have made more than 3 Counter Strikes so why do people dislike that PUBG doesnt run well its this companies first massive game. The servers are full all the time is something i heard alot well yes they are full cause everyone enjoys playing PUBG they have a safe capacity of 1 Million players and yet can have 3 Million concurrent players as their record!!!So what do I think well this game could have been made better sure but no other game devs have been able to have the same graphics and performance without increasing ping. Plus just for a second consider how big the maps are in PUBG so sure game devs have worked around this problem but the problem with the way they did is that it made that you couldnt see someone in a building from far cause they only load in when you get close enough it upps performance but lowers graphics plus makes camping in a building so much more op.Thx for reading hope you enjoy your decision I know I do,Recommended
This game has been nothing but a pure adrenaline rush to me. You will never forget the feeling when you first win. People compare it to H1Z1 all the time but the level of detail and feeling of this game blows it's competitors out of the water. Amazing level design makes every firefight an absolute blast. I could not recommend this game more highly if you are in to competitve shooters. Especially if you have friends to play it with.,Recommended
A really good game but spending money for keys to unlock crates and you get the same old useless thing again when you expected for something different. What a waste... Oh hackers? Seriously... They are destroying the game ! Do something about it !,Recommended

It's a good game but it needs some optimization done (which is whats being focused right now) it'd be great then. Reminds me a lot of my arma days.,Recommended

If you're planning on buying this game I have one thing to say to you. Find yourself a freind and play duo. If you go solo you will be matched up against giant who will only hide and wait for easy picks or campers who will shoot you down if you can't spot them in time. In duo alot of players man up and actually does something instead of playing safe. And also this game is still filled with many bugs that will ruin your gaming experience if you're really trying to win. Still a good game and I would recommend it to everyone that likes battle royale and/or shooters.,Recommended

It's a good game there are some hackers (and by some I mean some but it is a some relative to 20 million people so take that for what it is lol). If you are looking for a brutal battle royale game that fills you with adrenaline every time (mostly) and also lets you feel super accomplished when you are the winner winner chicken dinner then buy it. For 30$ it has replay value because the game concept is very linear but the experience is different every time. The developers seem to also be active in updates and patches and if you are smart enough you can make money off of this game. The only main issue you might encounter is a lot of people who might not speak the same language as you but the Earth has a lot of people so,Recommended

There will always be a group of little s camping in a house for as long as they can just to try and desperatly win since that will make them feel better about their pitiful and sad lives because the second they come off the computer they are most likely hiding from their familys in a tiny room hoping that one day someone will actually love them and as they slowely become crippled in the depression filled pit they live in they will realise that they have absolutely no meaning in life and are unimportant to human society they will finally ing kill themselves and as their last thoughts they will realise they have done the world and the PUBG community a massive favour and we will all be able to live happily and have fun games without little beta hiding in houses in the first zone until the last. you,Recommended

Product received for free. Fun for the people not so much for the computers. I understand that it is an early access game and since the full version will be released soon I hope for bug fixes and more OPTIMISATION. Honestly this game runs like Stephen Hawking. I hope it will run better after full release.,Recommended
So much bug to fix yet so fun to play..... just needs to fix server to prevent hackers in game (,Recommended
This game is 80% Luck5% Skill4% Concentrated Power of Will1% Pleasure10% PainAnd a 100% reason to purchase the game.,Recommended
Awesome game,Recommended
Awesome,Recommended
For achievement!,Recommended
I've been playing this game now for maybe 8 months and I find it never endingly amazing. It's the open world format combined with the challenges of fighting real time real players (some who seem ungodly good) and the strategic layout of the landscapes and buildings that populate the maps.While it is a challenge most of the time getting pinched between two teams for example can lead to someone rage quitting it still has a charm that I only remember from the original CS.,Recommended
I mean it's not just shotgun battles (FortNite) and the game runs pretty well even on my 970 4GB. I am not a huge fan of the battle royale genre but I do like this game over some of the other alternatives. Make sure that you READ REVIEW DATES as some of the most popular reviews are old and do not discuss current issues.,Recommended
I just gotta say that you should try it. I never got a win but I still enjoy playing the game. I always has a feel of suspence to it. at any time you could lose the game but in any game you have the potential of winning. Try it.,Recommended
Sick game,Recommended
fun addicting game,Recommended
Very good game. Requires strategy and patience in order to play. It will make you rage some times when you die but overall it is a fantastic game.,Recommended
Just can't beat this game accross the board. been on it since publicly playable and can't see myself stopping any time soon. always a new way to ambush someone with a pan. 9/10.,Recommended
"Product received for free. I initially wanted this game due to the hype surrounding. It was becoming the new thing. A lot of my friends started getting it but as someone on a budget I do like to do my research on a game before I buy it. Of course after looking at reviews I came to the conclussion that maybe this game wasnt right for me. ""Hacking server issues lack of region lock"" and the list goes on from user reviews. I ended up receiving the game as a gift and of course I was excited to get into this hyped game. Ill tell you after playing for the past couple weeks I really havent run into these issues that people have negatively reported. I will point out that the game is poorly optimized. I have to run all seetings on very low and still pull only 20 25fps. I still have hope that it will get fixed by the time its a full release. Would overall recommend Pubg though. It is a good deal of fun.",Recommended
I Love this game,Recommended
Product received for free. nice game,Recommended
This is my favorite 3rd 1st person shooter of all time. It is wonky sometimes but with friends it makes it all worth it. A must play!,Recommended
This game is amazing but the reason i tink it wont last for ever is due to you have to always have a whol lot of people playing and atm it feels so ing early access. I mean everytime the game crashes or i find a bug i just think Early access. It is for this game sort of an excuse to not be fully optimised but i think the developers are working hard on the game but sadly not polishing it. Yet it is still a really fun game to play.,Recommended
Great game but the devs put 0 thought into some things.. For example you can land on some of the islands in the game and not a single boat is spawned leaving you to die to the circle every time it happens. Ive tested it multiple times and the islands on this game are a death sentence as the devs dont seem to realise that not having vehicles available in this kind of situation ruins the gaming experience. Not to mention really bad movement and other bugs that really need a fix.,Recommended
I ing love this game and the theme of survival &lt 3 and the drive to improve and beat everyone xx,Recommended
Now my 28 minutes are so far going to be honest.After boarding a plane with no explanation and jumping into what i can only describe as a Butlins holiday island i managed to survive down to 20 people. Using only what i had gathered from bear grylls the island and an assortment of weapons strewn about i was finally killed after walking into a building and being shot upon entry by a shirtless woman brandishing an AK 47. 11/10 will keep playing.,Recommended
Squads,Recommended
GREAT MULTIPLAYER Okay you can read tons of reviews and opinions about this game. Does it deserve his fame? Probably not. Yeah I love this game and I love to continue play it but I think that it doesn't deserve his fame. WHY SHOULD I BUY IT?I think it's one of the greatest PVP game in the last years. I love looting in Dayz. So looting in this game it's like dayz. Constant go to places to loot. If you hate this don't buy it. Probably it's not the most realistic FPS you can find but it's satisfying to shoot in this game. Every single weapon has different handling and you must try long before you became good. CHEATERS CHEATERS EVERYWHEREYes cheaters are a big problem. Death cam and replays are useful to report them but they can ruin your match if you find them.Personally I advise this game. It repaid me with 30 dollars in sold chest.,Recommended
GOOD GAME !,Recommended

best game. though not yet optimised. i cant play in my laptop with 4 Gb of ram with 930 M nvidia . i play in my pc with a 1050 Nvidia and 8 gb ram it runs well and the ram usage is just around 5 gb now so i recoomend to have 8 gb ram atleast .Still early access and your dreams of getting a smooth gameplay with 200 fps are not possible so wait for the 1.0 update and just keep playing PUBG ...,Recommended
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is an interesting game. It perfectly represents the Battle Royale concept and it never falls short. The game has minor bugs but nothing game changing. Bluehole is constantly fixing updating and giving the players what they would like to see in the game. The loot consistancy is great the hitboxes are more than perfect weapon damage at the moment could use some work but overall the game is pretty good. My opinion on the blue forcefield is that it should last a little longer before pushing people in to the white safe area.Vaulting and this new map coming out will keep us fans of PUBG playing the game.,Recommended

Yeah I guess it's fun and all. It can get stale after a while and new maps can't fix that.

I recommend it to users that don't crack under pressure and can take a defeat without crying themselves to death.,Recommended

"I bought the game after a few days when it came out and I loved it. Till today I still enjoy it. Good game recommend it better than H1Z1.The game just keep on getting better and better. New map weapons vehicls and now events. There are new bugs after new patchs but hey like this happens in softwares (reminds me of my fukn Java assignment). After a new patch and there is a bug that does influence game play eg in the old UI ""no randos in squads"" tickbox didn't work once and they solved it pretty quick the time where the in game screen is all up they fixed that pretty quick too.The developers actually update stuff unlike h1z1 they once said they fixed the double door problem (just one of the bugs) I decided to give it a go *opens a door at top of a building"" it's a fukn double door. Now H1Z1 is adding new things more constantly this is because back in the day H1Z1 was the only Battle Royale game and the developers dogged us because they were like &amp quot their aint any other BR game so either play me game or off"". Even though they fixed most of the stuff stole some ideas from pubg eg compass adding markers to map etc it still aint getting me back into the game. They didn't listen to the community the guns' recoil makes the cross hair snaps to the left and right instead of going up now they are doing all these updates is because they have competitors now. On the other hand PUBG does listen to the community and makes changes accordingly.For my opinion on hackers yes they do get banned. My own Chinese friends one borrowed his account to his friends and apparently this friend of his uses hacks which got my mate's account banned. RIP. I met this other dude online and a few days later he told me he got bored so he bought a hack and got his account banned. RIP. It's anti cheat system is working. For those who writes in Chinese ""I did nothing and I got banned"" off will ya you don't get banned for doing nothing By the way one of the reasons why they didn't region lock China is because H1Z1 did that and they lost too many players. And besides you do get some Chinese who hacks or team kills but there are still a lot of nice people too.",Recommended
Broken but op fun,Recommended
you,Recommended
the game is fun and exciting when you get down to the last few players but there are so many bugs and performance issues the game hangs on the loading screen crashes often and uses nearly 6Gb of ram when running. The development team have a lot of work to do to optimize it. It's not worth the price I'd say it's worth closer to $10 in it's current state.,Recommended
If you want to experience what online gaming was like in the late 90s get this game. The lag and glitches leading to your eventual death will have you spewing rage at your monitor only to find yourself joining a new game moments later thirsty for a taste of what the game might be. Currently the concept is much better than the gameplay. I'll be back to it in a month... or two...,Recommended
The people of PUBG taught me even more offensive words than I already knew.,Recommended
I love this game &lt 3 bc its make me happy D,Recommended
This game is terrible. It's poorly optimised buggy as hell easily hackable and virtually supportless.It's goddamn fun as hell though.,Recommended
"Product received for free. Best ""Early Access Game"" till now hope devs will add more content and totally recommended this to gamers new to steam",Recommended
Although I have not played PUBG for a long time I can say that I have enjoyed the time I have put into it. Some parts can be unstable but it is worth every minute I put into it.,Recommended
Fun tactical shooter to play when your bored!,Recommended
okay nice game! HAHAHA EZ CHICKEN DINAAH,Recommended
Great game but devs need to improve on fixing bugs faster.,Recommended
"Having played for over 80 hours most of it in early 2018 I reckon this is a pretty decent game. Sure it has its down points but they are heavily outweighed by the ups.DOWN 1) Poorly optimzed to the point that this game has become a 'benchmark' for hardware ""Will X system play PUBG?"" Not a good look. I play with a GTX970 clocked 'n' cooled FX8370 and 16GB of fast dual channel DDR3... and it runs okay. People are getting reasonable results with Ryzen 3's / G4560's and GTX750ti's but I would think that at this stage an SSD or M.2 drive is mandatory to optimise the experience even then most likely limied to 60fps on 'Very Low' settings. 2) Hackers. Yes there are hackers big suprise. I play Oceania (I'm Australian) on first person view and find there aren't a heap but most third person games seem to have one or two hackers or teamers in them. Once I was covering the entry to the second story of a building when I heard a smash and died. Deathcam showed someone spawning into my corpse and no explanation for how I died at all. What the hell??? For the most part I don't have problems but occasionally there are issues with hackers.3) Lootcrates. They are average at best and its a grind if you want to keep getting them. I keep the pay to open crates in my inventory as it seems as soon as you stockpile 3 to 4 of them your liklihood of getting more drops. Get rid of them or open them and you instantly get more. Yay... not. The customisation is moot for the most part as a standard grey shirt and brown pants provides good camo for most areas anyway. Maybe thats just me being spartan... and cheap... but whatever.4) Sound. Overall not terrible but good surround would be nice!So whats about the UPS?1) Hugely diverse open word maps. Sure theres only two (and a third incoming) maps but they are vast and lots of fun to play. With 80 hours on record I'm still familiarising myself with areas of each map to the point that I am still finding little areas (and some larger ones) I havent explored yet. Lot of fun.2) Great looting! Find your weapons come find your weapons get 'em in the dust! Lock and load an assault rifle for you sir? Nicely done. And you ma'am? Oh no bad luck there's only a frypan and a beanie in this hut! Hahaha... classic.3) Intense combat. So a round lasts about 30 minutes until the final few players get ushered into the tiny last areas and kill each other... and imagine being one of them waiting until the next zone shrink so you can rush forward scanning all the terrain popping a player or two in the face as you go watching that ""Player Remaining"" count drop... only to be completely blinsided by the 2nd or 3rd last player in the game! AH! So much suspense intensity and fun.4) Replayability. Doesnt matter whether its the 1st time or the 1000th this is a hella fun game. Every drop is different sometimes some random will yell out ""Hey everyone go some landmark "" and whaddaya know everyone does! Intense fighting followed by anything from a mad rush to the combat zone or intense anticipation as the zone forms on top of you and you have to decide whther to wait it out or risk going to the next house in search of better loot...Overall? A must play and reasonably priced for what it is. Get it just so you know what the hype is about and don't be surprised if you find yourself playing for hours on end match after match chasing that elusive Chicken Dinner!",Recommended

Superb game that is very relaxing and is compatible with different playstyles. Do you play it safe and stealthy looting from rural villages? Do you compete with more experienced players at military bases for a chance to emerge with the best loot? Do u go to school just to kill as many people as you can before been killed yourself? Do you play on first person only servers? I personally take the safe approach and usually play third person allthough when me and my mates play squad we launch organised offensives onto villages housing other squads. Game looks decent at a mixture of medium to low graphics. It also has more realistic recoil and bullet drop and velocity so you can't just spray at the head at medium to long range.,Recommended

This has been a great game. I know a lot of people are upset about microtransactions being introduced because it breaks a promise from the developer. I personally always expected it happen so I don't care when it happened. I won't be putting in the money for it but I don't mind that it is there. If the money will help continue to develop this game I am all down for it. I have and will continue to recommend this game to friends. Look forward to seeing what is to come next. I don't usually write reviews but felt inclined because of the negativity recently. Frustratingly fun!,Recommended

My favorite game. ever.,Recommended
This game rewards strategy tactics aim weapon discipline driving abilities timing ammo/supply management .. Any little detail you can think of and try to use to your advantage you will be rewarded for it. And you will be punished hard for your carelessness or inattentiveness. Looting complacently running blindly across an open field always playing catch up with the play zone even sloppy skydiving and parachuting... You will be punished for all this. Definitely not a relaxing game definitely not a game that cares about your feelings. Very raw very intense.,Recommended
I absolutely hate this game. 10/10,Recommended

PUBG is a really fun game. It's really fun for the 1st 30 hours if you play solo but after that you get bored. In the beginning you might get bored because you are not skilled enough and you barely get any kills and you keep on dying but trust me the more you play the better you will get and the game will be more fun. PUBG is also super fun if you play with friends. I am so addicted to this game even though when i started i wasnt that addidcted. I now have 125 hours in this game,Recommended
Really good game but really bad optimized if you have the computer to run it then there is no problem very adictive and it can pay itsalf selling lootboxes,Recommended

Firstly TL/DR it s a good game if you are lucky to not be matched into games with hackers or have a few friends to play with. But be prepared for pure rage at points usually for stupidly dumb reasons.Overall 6/10 buy this game when it's on sale if you have friends to play it with or just wait until the problems are solved. Game Breakdown The concept for this game is get 100 people stick em on a plane and send that plane over a deserted island jump out and land where you want to start the game. good concept but when you put it into practice you are basically playing loot simulator 2017. you get all this sweet loot and then die for the stupidest reason that you probably caused and then watch as the person who killed you just loots through your stuff to take your carefully selected loot. but that's the nature of the beast just be aware of that going in.This game is a good game at its core. the game's mechanics and overall gameplay are pretty unique and feels pretty realistic. the fact that the devs have done their research into the weapons into the game and that their names appearance and mechanics are identical to the real thing is pretty good. no call of duty renaming existing weapons or anything (which is just something that is one of my pet peeves pretty stupid i know)solo games are pretty boring in my opinion they are either easy to win or you die to someone hacking or for equally stupid reasons (again usually your own fault playing recklessly or not paying attention) duo's are probably the best gametype in my opinion it's not overwhelming when it comes to coordinating your group or making sure everyone lands in the right place. and of course tying into that you have full 3 4 man groups which can either be great or can be horrible. it's usually pretty bad if you are the only one to die right at the start and you have to watch your squad win while basically looking at memes for the 20min that it takes em to either all die or win the match. How i want the devs to improve this game Outside of repetitive game feel as there is only one map at the moment and the HUGE PROBLEM WITH HACKERS (see below) The biggest problem i have with this game s mechanics is that you are able to kill downed players granted downed players aren't always killed by the enemy but it's pretty common to be killed. The devs should really consider removing the downed players ability to move and make it so they can't die to bullets this increases the chance that you and your friend don't need to now worry about the other players gunning your friend and ruining your game just out of spite or whatever reason. Granted this stance of the problem is pretty polarizing and i'm sure A LOT of people will hate that idea but it's just what i think this game needs to improve gameplay for full squads or duo s this games 2 giant problems Firstly Hackers just . Hackers everywhere. Speed hackers people who are running 10 times faster than some cars move. Aimbots people who seem to land every single shot with a pistol from halfway across the map. Arm stretching this hack lets hackers raise their aim down sights up into the air its pretty hard to explain but think of it as making their gun float in the air while their body is still safe inside the building below the gun. The devs are banning people left and right but this game has no sort of kill cam so we don't really know if we were killed by a hacker or if it was just skill or luck on the other player's account. Frankly the devs need to add this in fortnight battle royal has this feature if i remember right so it is possible for them to add some sort of 10 second capture before your death from the other players perspective.Secondly there is no ping cap these servers are open to everyone and i'm sorry if this is insensitive foreign players go play on your own servers the asia european atlantic and many other servers are there for a reason. This game's second huge problem is players with ping ranging from 400 2000 joining a game and this game being client side hitboxes meaning if my ping takes 2000 ms to ping the server and return the info to me on my screen your player will still be running in the field for me but on your end you will be safely behind a tree when i shoot you in the face and you are dead on the floor this is the most enraging thing and the devs have done nothing to stop this. It's a stupidly simple fix they could impose a simple ping check at the beginning of a match is your ping above 300ms? If yes then you are not able to join this game it's a soft fix to the game's biggest problem it doesn't have to be a ping check during the entire game just at entry to the servers that way if you have a ping spike in the game you won't be auto kicked out and this way it keeps the unwanted players out of our server with their client clearly gaining preference for their ping values. Final Thoughts All in all this game is faaaar from perfect but it's still actually pretty fun the devs are working on most of the problems they have new game mechanics being introduced soon and a new map that they have been teasing for like 6 months now. The game is definitely a game to play with some friends but i feel you won't get the full experience just playing it solo. At least one of the problems are being fixed or being addressed at the very least and the other problem will be fixed eventually if people keep bringing that problem to the developers attention.,Recommended
Good game!,Recommended
Fun Game which has made huge improvements over the last couple months,Recommended
Cool game,Recommended
Although there a crashes optimization issues cheaters etc. I thouroughly enjoy this game pretty much everytime I play it. Yes there are instances where you just get shot in the back by a sniper ar etc. and don't even know where it came from but there are also those satisfying times you can sneak up on someone or just barely come out victorious a gun fight and of course getting those lovely chicken dinners. Like many people have said before this game is very fun to play with friends.8/10,Recommended
Many hours played with friends squad. Really good game ),Recommended
Product received for free. I like this game. But hackers so many. I hope PUBG can improve that problem.,Recommended
"""We want to make the game as realistic as possible"" said the game devsThen why in the world was my motorcycle stuck to a rock and started wiggling like it's on some kind of drugs exploded and killed my entire squad? That is not realistic at all........Also instead of releasing more content maybe you guys should consider fixing this severe cheating issues? I assume changing the length of your arm can't be done in real life. Also stop using battleye that thing is useless af.And last but not least I can't crawl through a god damn arch in the playground. Will you guys do me a favour and fix that as well. Thanks.The game is pretty fun though.",Recommended
I love this game there is no rush like it tbh. but a couple of things ruin it for me. Firstly the lack of a server near South Africa. The second cheaters are a massive problem and I feel they can compensate us for the fact that our ranks and ultimately BP get affected by cheaters! But yes put emotes in the game.,Recommended
I was wary of buying this game at first because of the fact that it was early release. Most games and with few exceptions have failed to make me have as much fun as playing this game. I am incredibly excited to see how the finished product looks as I have already fallen in love with it. I have managed to convince a few of my other friends to get it and we have been playing every day since then. The only downsides that I can see so far in this game is that there are some issues with connecting to friends at times through the lobby where it would say they are offline and there is some issues at times with trying to aim through windows or over barricades where sometimes you would hit the edge of the cover instead of the enemy though this is hardly an issue most times (just would be nice if they tweaked it). Otherwise I love it!,Recommended
Academy Strategy will win you the games. if you're reading this and understand you have the recipe for success,Recommended
Awesome if your willing to commit and study it s unseeming complexity. 7.5/10 for funNever forget its still in early acces sure there is a lot of improvment but the developers don t seem like they are giving up on its flaws. There are constant updates bug fixes and new gear to play with. With the new Map thats coming out soon for a big fan like myself playing it from the start the game is going to spike in popularity again.Enjoyable even with noobie friends not as competitive as all other games nowerdays.Buckle up positive this game will be top of the charts for a while. Before EA buys them ofcourse XDSee yall out there,Recommended

I find it incredibly frustrating even win s are sometimes not enjoyable. LULBut I can t stop playing it.......,Recommended
I don't write too many reviews but I feel like this game deserves honest feedback so here goes This game is fun as hell!! Especially with friends but it also can fry your nerves because unexpectedly dying in this game sucks. Overall this game has a ton of awesome potential but it is in alpha so it's laggy and a little bit buggy but this is one of the best developed alphas ive ever played and well worth the money because I feel like even though the devs are a small team they're going to try and develop this game as best they can. Overall 8/10 but for being in alpha 10/10 so far.,Recommended
This game is intense. I purchased this game because I saw JackFrags playing it on YouTube. Look them up for an idea of how awesome this game is don't take my word for it.,Recommended
CURRENT REVIEW NON EARLY ACESS I still absolutley love this game but it had some problems here is what PUBG Corp fixed and did not fix.PUBG's preformance has gotten much better.Their map making skills have gotten much better Miramar looks really nice and very lived in.The sound design and UI are great but this leads me into my only gripes The map looks really grey and I think it is a step down from the previous early acess version.There are still hackers and other nasty cheaters but PUBGCorp has gotten better at dealing with it.Something that is not a gripe but more of a question is will old PUBG menu music return. I actaully kinda liked it...Overall the quality has increased and is worth your 30 dollars.At this point I give it a 9.5/10 expect sweaty palms.THE ENTIRITY OF MY EARLY ACESS REVIEW OK There are some good things and bad things about this game. THE GOOD PUBG is a fun action packed game that requires high skill quick thinking good long term thinking deep knowledge of the game and how it works. It's loot and scoot gameplay has tons of fun. You can play with different preferences different stratagys.PUBG has large open maps with lots of destinations and with enough unique buildings to make the map feel very believable though there are a lot of re used assets it's ok for the most part it doesn't detract from gameplay and the map is still pretty interesting. The way loot is distibuted onto these maps is very good.The gameplay is camping running looting and fighting the camping is tense but boring at times (which further adds to the dread) running is tense looting is tense and rewarding fighting is tense and action packed. It's an exciting game.The game is really fun to watch. It's one of the best games to play with friends while it is also lots of fun to play solo. I highly reccomend you play for these reasons. HOWEVER THE BAD PUBG naturally has lots of streamers and as you can probably see from the other reviews stream sniping is the problem PUBG corp has to get it together the streamers are getting themselves into that situation. I understand it promotes this game but seriously the game has sold 10 000 000 copies do you really think people don't know about it by now. It's silly people are being banned.Preformance is very poor I have a GTX 1070 and it still runs very poorly the game is still in early acess though and I have seen the game improve on preformance greatly from when I first purchased PUBG. For some reason PUBG corp doesn't beef up its servers despite have bucketloads of cash.The bugs are rampant though there are increasingly fewer as time goes on I doubt this will be a huge problem in the future just a heads up.There are microtransactions this THIS made me so angry this is unacceptable. they've made at least 60 000 000 dollars. Don't get any crates it's not worth it it just isn't. It literally makes no sense I won't rant about it much longer but it makes me ANGERY.There are also a lot of hackers in PUBG which occur on a 40% basis they're annoying and no fun to play against and they're not getting banned... SO IS IT ANY GOOD? yeah it has some problems but it's really fun too,Recommended
Lemme start off from the very bat I thought this was a copy of h1z1 King of the Kill and it was a cash grab project...Boy was I wrong.Buy this game if you want to die every 5 minutes.,Recommended
OK so this is the best battlegrounds based game out there by far. Good solid controls. It does have some minor issues that can be frustrating but it is in Early Access. Overall I recommend the game if you like games such as H1Z1 King of the Kill. This is a must have game for all competitive players out there. No game breaking glitches or bugs to worry about. Just beware of not flying with the vehicles since they are alittle wonky at times and can go flying into space if you hit someone while landing from a flying position. Or just try to ram another car.

The new test server has made the game amazing it looks great and is a ton more fun,Recommended
The game has lots of bugs but it's an early access game so we'll have to wait. Besides that it's a very strategic game and playing with friends is even funnier. Can't wait to see the game in its final version.,Recommended
It's a great game when considering itself alone from all other elements. I hate supporting in game gambling but its got ahold of me since I started. I hope they stick to more ethical ways of monetization but in the meantime the game is very enjoyable with some buddies.,Recommended
Very Exciting!,Recommended
This game brings so much fun for me especially when I play together with my friends. However its development is so slow knowning how succesful this game has been.7/10,Recommended
Are you bored of Fortnite? or any other battle royale games? Try this one I guarentee you will be crazy because of it's gameplay. The gameplay is fun but it's very hard. You need a lot of skills a lot of coordination and plans and trusted teammates. Although it's hard you can also chill in this game by doing silly things. Buy this game at discount because it's more worth it than you spending your money at full price. Be patience and play safe ),Recommended
"Before you read the rest of the review check if these things apply to you. You have a powerful rig that can handle the latest gen games at a stable frame rate. You do not consider yourself a casual FPS player You like tactical shooters(not run and gun) You do not mind the potential downtime you will have during a battle royale game(looting running etc)PUBG was the first big hit for this genre and it is still played a lot today. I know H1Z1 KotK happened but PUBG was much more popular during its peak time. I have been with this game since nearly the beginning when I had a ""dollar store"" PC and now I have a powerful gaming PC that can handle this games lack of optimization. Back in the beta the game was new the battle royale genre was booming and I had plenty of friends to play with who all genuinely enjoyed the game. The voice chat was cancerous in a way we all knew and loved. The game was buggy but we all expected that for an EA game. Now it has been released for almost 7 months and a lot of things that should have been fixed haven't. Sound is still subpar compared to other tactical shooters like Rainbow 6 Siege the servers have always had issues with too many players and entities in the same space and the way parachuting works is constantly changing so only the players that keep up with the meta know how to land multiple seconds before others giving them a significant advantage. I put up with the bugs and server issues because I can honestly say I have never played a better battle royale. Fortnite didn't do it for me and Realm Royale is closer but wasn't my cup of tea because I prefer military shooters not fantasy. I have made friends through this game that I won't ever forget and I have some great memories with those friends.I wish I could recommend this game to everyone but I can't. If you have a bad PC don't buy this game. If you don't want to pay attention to the patch notes and meta don't buy this game. If don't want to think about positioning and listening for other players don't buy this game.But if you do want a tactical military battle royale shooter then PUBG is definitely the game for you.also the game is still only $30 which I appreciate. I do not think I would recommend it at $60.",Recommended

A 150 word review PLAYERUNKNOWN's BATTLEGROUNDS is a battle royale multiplayer FPS/TPS (You can choose) game. The gameplay is solid* the shooting feels good* and the RNG loot system* works really well. Maps are well designed for the most part and the game is getting new additions constantly*. I put the asterisks because 4 problems hinder this product The game has a lanudry list of netcode problems it's at 18hz when it really should be 30 minimumThe game has performance issues for some systems it runs 60fps above on my rig but it might be diffirent to youThe game really needs a region lock lots of players taking advantage of the poor netcode The game has an anti cheat system that's stopping hackers but not fast enoughI still enjoy the game there is nothing like it.4/5,Recommended

I am I am and I say that this game is a solid 8/10 the hitboxes of physics objects like cars are a bit off and if you have a high ping it makes everyone look like a cheater in deathcams but it is so satisfying to get an elimination in this game or last a long time through the game and then die. GOD has spoken.,Recommended
it was a fun game but its really hard too aiming in this game is srsly the problem need to practice more and more,Recommended
Nice battle royale game with great graphics and there are some hackers but i still love this game.,Recommended
My second favorite game (After Rocket League). At the first I thought 30 for this game is too much but I watched some videos and streams and I bought it(100% worth it). Finally I got good experience with an early acces game. I like the dev team and I hope they will made as many contet as they can. D GLHF,Recommended
Repeatability I dont know what it is about this game but i can have the longest gaming sessions with friends on this one game more so then ever before. Even solo I will play for hours on end. Hacking is a problem but in what online game isnt it. As soon as they patch something hackers find the next loop hole.,Recommended
You know it's a big deal when an Early Access game beats CS GO and DOTA 2 on the leaderboard of the most played games on Steam (27/8/2017)8.5/10Would headshot with a Pan againThere's definitely a BUT This game still needs a lot of optimisation and has random frame drops at times even for my friends who have really good PCs but the devs are working on it before release and we'll see how that will turn out.,Recommended
greate game still alot to be done. and need south african servers please,Recommended
Product received for free. Good game,Recommended
This game still needs optimization but it's early access. If all they did was optimize this game and ensure that ingame voice chat worked. This game would be perfect. Not being able to reliably trash talk players in game before putting them out of their misery is really the only current downfall.For those who have played h1z1 King of the KIll this game is what that game should have been and then x10.This is the third early access game I would recommend. Subnautica and Space Engineers are the other two.,Recommended

"Overall 3.5/5 starsPUBG The original battle royale game. While you may be more familiar with Epic Games wildly successful Fortnite this was the first and some might say the best. While I've enjoyed PUBG immensely it's hard to say how this title and the batte royale genre will hold up over time. And even if I'm not playing in three or five years time I'm having a whole lot of fun with it right now despite some of its shortcomings. But should you buy it?Gameplay 4/5 starsFirefights are great and there's some really tactical play that you can dive into here. The gunplay tries to be more realistic than most shooters and you'll have to lead your target at certain ranges and your shots will drop over distance. Guns are based on 'real life' weapons and the developers have tried to make each gun's performance match the ballistic properties of the particular round it actually shoots. There are lots of RNG elements in this game and that's okay with me. You never know what loot you'll find where the circles will end up or if you'll get destroyed by a random redzone. In order to be the last man or last squad standing it will take a little of both luck and skill to get it done.Where PUBG really shines is with friends. In my experience I've had the most fun strategizing and working toward those tasty chicken dinners with pals. Solo offers a good time sure. If you're into the stealthy stuff and you know if you are you'll absolutely love solo. Graphics 2.5/5 starsThe graphics are just okay. You won't be blown away by either of the two available maps as of the time of this review. Textures are very basic you won't find any fancy features you've seen in AAA titles for the past five years maybe because this game is derived from another toned down title called Arma 3. If you're looking for a smooth polished visual treat you're going to be very disappointed here. Developer Support/Bugs 1/5 starsIt's probably fair to say Bluehole has done a fairly poor job in supporting this game and it shows given the surge in popularity of Fortnite PUBGs primary competitor. Community requests like map selection went ignored for what seemed like eons while the company pushed out extremely weak weapon skins. Bluehole chooses to conduct server maintenance and implement patches in prime gaming time on the east coast of the US around 10pm. In the past few months the company has been experimenting with various gametypes on a limited time basis that have added some extra flavor. It's a lot of reactionary moves based on what the competition is up to but it's nice to see.Value 3/5 stars This game is really fun and a great way to spend a few hours a night with friends. The introduction of new event modes and the gradual release of new maps gives me hope for the survival of the game long term. With the random nature of each game ""replayability"" value is high. Maps are absolutely huge and there are areas of each map I've never seen yet. Overall I think there's many more hours of play for me here.",Recommended

Even if i or we can just run it on 40fps on all very low settings with the specs we have we would appreciate it. Anyway a good game definetly recommend it,Recommended

If you like the battle royale genre then I think hands down this is the best option. It is one of the only ones that takes its asthetics into account which may not matter to others but I think it shows the dedication of the developers. It also has a dedicated team behind it regardless of what the trolls want to say this game has constatnt support from its developers. Unlike Fortnite and H1Z1 there is no crafting element for better or for worse so what you get is what you get. This means there is some luck involved in each game which can be frustrating for some. All in all I think it is a great game and I think if this is the type of genre you like most likely you are already playing this but if not you should give it a try.,Recommended

This is a casual team game. Sadly at this point there is very little veriety with one map and cheaters everywhere.There are teaming squads and some real lack of content. The texture optimization is simply awful. With all that said. PubG is truley fun for about 200 matches then you get a little boared perhaps a 50v50 mode or zombies may help to freshen the game up a bit.So there is some solid good things and some real stagering weeknesses in this game none the less I give it a 7/10Plenty of room for improvment. But a solid foundation to work with.,Recommended

This game is quite fun and has its heart pounding moments. It is much better with freinds especially ones that dont rage like the stramers everyone complains about. I watched a streamer(no names for sake of rage) for about 5 minutes playing this game. as soon as he died he reported the person for stream sniping. This does happen and people who deny it are dumb.Bottom line Game is fun with freinds but is repetative and boaring alone.,Recommended
Tickrate is 60hz now game confirmed good again,Recommended
The game is very very VERY intense although slow paced. There is no hop in for a quick game (yet) some buckle for a ride that will last you a solid half hour of intensly scavinging for guns in schools and looting houses like never before. COD and other typical shooters have no thrill running and dying gets you a pic and the battle is have a high K/D. This feels like what a shooter should be. Punishing you for dying like you deserve (you WILL die ALOT no matter you Battlefield 1 K/D). Best parts inckude actually putting me on the edge of my seat lets be honest Titanfall 2's campiagn to a solid 4 hours of simply gameplay (and COD III even less) without the basic boringness of a campaign the game makes you learn through dying. Rage inducing but in the end actually helps those who do rage. It self prevents toxicity from drunk COD players and those normal people who want to play the game play the game. In solo you hide for your life in duo you and a friend can win with teamwork and in squad you get a random German guy in the NA server because he's stupid and your 4th friends mic is broken (mic is required for teamplay really). The game has already put itslef in Steams best with three modes 1 map and basic game requirements. With a zombie mode a fluid movement system and more coming expect to have lots of fun coming with more and more patches and updates. Buff pistols. Please.,Recommended

Amazing game with many flaws. This game is really competetive so if you are not good at shooters just go play fortnite with the 12 year olds. The gameplay is amazing when it is working correctly. The loot system could be better as I am level 21 and i still have not received the skull mask when people that are level 2 get it. the loot system is useless as you grind for achivements only to get a striped shirt for a limited time. Other than that there are hacker but it is not as big of a problem as people make it out to be. I only see one hacker out of every 30 games i play if that people that claim hackers are usually people with bad enternet or computers or they are just bad at the game in general. Pub G does have a little bit of a desync problem as well. Even with these flaws I still recommend the game as it is my most played game and I believe this is nthe best br out there and it is a very fun shooter once you get the hang of it. If you are thinking about getting a good br game other than fortnite just get this one as no other br's and not too many shooters compare to this game.,Recommended
I like the game cause its fun,Recommended
Pretty neat game doin this for steam stickers,Recommended
good game,Recommended
a helluva lot of fun. yes there are bugs and i've seen maybe a handful of cheaters in the hours that i've played. but really it's a lot of fun and isn't that why we play games?,Recommended
"This game is so much fun. Yes there are glitches bugs and server lag. Yes I know the lame excuse is ""early access"" but if you buy an early access game expecting perfection then you wasted money. This game is the first game in a while where I can put countless hours into it with friends. The development team and PLAYER UNKNOWN are so good and keep this community informed and bring monthly updates which fix the actual game instead of cosmetics. This game is 10/10 and I cant wait to see what it becomes.",Recommended
Cheaters aren't the problem for me.It's the people that pinned me to the ground like a Bully in SQUAD.They're the real problem in PUBG.Awful people who has joy over pinning their own teammates to the ground multiple times.If it was REAL LIFE i'd enjoy it.. but in this game it's more of an annoyance than lust for more.If you're one of these people i hope you trip on a rock &amp fall into a pool of lava.Yes i can get sexual if i wanted to.. it's my body i do what i want.No You're not allowed to get sexual with me.Pervert.,Recommended

I have been playing this game for a short period however I am already in LOVE with it. It has a simplistic yet amazing graphical design in game and supports many areas of the world hense giving you the best experience. The gameplay experience is incredible and original. The way of the game also is strategically tactical. I would recommend this game to all FPS lovers and beyond. Thanks for the amazing game!,Recommended
Can you guys make replay in solo? plz would be great )great game fun.,Recommended

Best game ever !!! but 9/10 because driving motorcycle is too fix it please.I prefer it with friends but it isn't soo boring playing Solo.,Recommended
This is the most thrilling horror game on steam.,Recommended
This is not game of the year material and does not deserve a steam award. With that being said when 1.0 came out the game became more optimized and hackers died out. The game runs smoothly on my pc and that can be the same for many others. Any negative reviews saying things like hackers are verywhere and the game is unoptimized should not be relevant at this moment. This game while quirky and annoying at some points can be a blast for you and your friends. If you feel like trolling them by taking a car and leaving them to die shooting them constantly or even taking all the loot and not giving it to them. However you can also be serious and employ tactics to obtain that ever elusive chicken dinner. If you are on the fence about this game don't be. It is fun tactical and an experience every casual shooter fan should have.,Recommended
So far i enjoy the game. But! I am trying to change my control setting everytime I hit apply it dose not save and now for some odd reason the settings reset so now my player will not move or do anything even if i try to apply the default setting it still will not save . If this is a glich in the game can it be fixed ASAP please so i can get back to kicking butt lol.. or i might just be doing something wrong. Someone help!!,Recommended

cool game,Recommended
GREAT games sure it has its bugs ect but it's quite new and the devs are working on it so don't give them negative feedback for it. Worth the money!,Recommended
I get 30 fps on low with a gtx 750 ti but honestly this game is good enough to still make it fun and playable. I experienced frequent freezing but it seemed to go away after the first week of playing which i found weird.If you have an intel laptop RIP.If you have a 750 ti or higher this is a must buy.Also APPARENTLY once this game gets out of early access the price will rise from $30 to $60. Just something to keep in mind.,Recommended
I don't do game reviews only reason I'm doing this is cus there are so many negative reviews and I think that is wrong Amazingly fun game Gets the adrenaline going even though it can be slow paced depending on play style ACTIVE DEVS regular updates regular new material glitches have been getting fixed slowly but surelyfor everyone complaining about getting banned because they didn't do anything wrong i think we know that 90% of that is BS and that they were abusing some bug or stream sniping or some other sort of bannable offense and if they weren't it is a rare occurance that can be rectified with the devs. If you are scared that you are gunna get banned for nothing then don't be. Yes they are strict yes you can/will get banned for team killing but I'd prefer it be strict then people be able to abuse glitches and bugs all the time. follow the rules youll be fine,Recommended

a great game but PLEASE FIX THE BUG ISSUES AND THE SERVERSSOMETIMES IT IS LAGGY SOMETIMES THE GAME FREQUENTLY CRASHESPLEASE OPTIMIZE THE GAME &gt,Recommended
One of the best games out there right now. I have spent around 80 hours just in 1 week because i am so hooked. At first the game is very hard and you lose every firefight but after around 20 30 hours u start understanding and getting good. Playing with friends is the most fun thing to do duo or Squad.If you dont have any friends with this game that's fine! Jump into squad game and in time people will ask for your steam account and you will get new friends. So far i have not experienced any major glitches not even minor ones. I have only meet one hacker so far in 250 games so i don't see why people complain. Overall it's very fun game if you enjoy games as DayZ or arma III you will enjoy this ),Recommended
its good,Recommended
Good and Fun game,Recommended
Probably the best of the genera. Still a lot of work to do regarding optimization but 10/10 would buy it again.,Recommended
Nice game,Recommended
There are a lot of mature players with mics from my random team play so far. I've been having a blast starting as a team of four scavenging the island as we make our way to the ever decreasing play area. Its very fun realistic feeling to hear gunshots in the distance or even see an enemy and make decicions to fight or avoid due to the one life nature. If you die its quick to get into another match so its not very painful. Highly recommend this game even for random team but espectially with a friend.,Recommended
Excellent wholesome fun. Ignore the negative reviews from those who are crying about having to purchase a key to open a cosmetic item that has no effect ingame.,Recommended
Yeah the server stability can be absolute most of the time. But the tense gameplay and addicting feeling when you're in the elusive 10 left alive makes up for it. I'm sure that improvements are on their way just hang in there.,Recommended
Nice,Recommended
It's still so poorly optimized it's eating 4+ gigs of ram. Every time i try to make an action the game freezes if i shoot the game freezes if i get into a vehicle the game freezes if i open menu the game freezes. I can't even enjoy i might even have to refund if it doesn't improve fast.Regardless it seems a lot of fun. The customizations on the weapons are really cool and the scavaging part is awesome!,Recommended
SOOO i have played this game a lot.i have found in the beginning it was a pretty good battle royale game with standard featuresstart in lobby drop from planego into building under fire find any weapon.....(or not)get killed or kill run around find better lootget killed by no recoil cheat or chinese type hacker rinse repeat.that about sums it up but it is a good thrilling game (also motorcycles there is some real laughs there)the BIG downside and i mean BIg is the cheats they are actually destroying this gamei still recommend the game but seriously the cheats are getting terrible every game...i mean EVERY game you will find one...be warned...,Recommended
Very fun Solo duo and squad at times it can be frustrating and I hope they fix the lag soon make sure you grab a weapon before anyone else! I recommend playing this game.,Recommended
This game is what H1Z1 should be. One of the most addicting games I have played in years having friends to play with makes it that much better. Fully recommend this and it is well worth the $30 for an alpha/early access game.,Recommended
I think i've only ever met 1 hacker in my entire time playing this so i dont know what everyone is complaining about. This is THE BEST game when i want to play a game with friends. you can choose to mess about and have fun or go for it without actually ruining the expience for other players. 9/10,Recommended

"Congrats Player Unknown you did it! You made a great game and then turned it into a pile of steaming hot diarrhea. When the game officially rolled out it wasvery exciting. It ran extremely smooth FPS was at an all time high and there was zero crashing. AND THEN YOU HAD TO GO AND F&amp %K WITH IT. Every single update you have come out with since the release has made the game more and more unplayable. I can't go more than three games without it crashing. Forget getting loot when you first drop. If you're lucky enough to not clip off of your intended target nothing will be loaded in and you will most likely get stuck in some book shelf that wasnt there 2 seconds ago. I know what you are thinking. ""Maybe this guy just has a potato for a computer"" aside from going out buying a Titan X every component of my computer is top of the line. Every single person that has taken part in the destruction of this game since its release need to pack their Your coders must have learned from a codeing for dummies book because every single time they go in to try and ""fix"" a non existant issue such as having people all over the map during the pre game lobby they up something vital to the game. Next update FIX YOUR F%$*ING GAME rather than adding some dumb a$$ decal for the buildings that advertise your Asian invitational that no one cares about. Simple solution for fixing it get rid of every single update you have come out and start over. We have given you plenty of money now give us a functioning game. Fortnite has created a working game in a fraction of the time. Its not hard. Also stairway railings might as well be a shield and when you break glass from shooting and it causes you to unscope is probably something you should work on.",Recommended

Two suggestions I feel strongly about is that there really needs to be an option to let players choose what map they want and please bring back weather conditions such as rain. Majority of the community believe that there should be an option to choose the map and bringing back weather conditions will make the game more enjoyable. Thank you.,Recommended

Overall PUBG is a very good and fun experience. It comes with lots of action if you try to play aggressive. The pros are Immersive gameplay it gets very tense in the late game realistic gun mechanics range of guns a lot of skill required good graphics. The cons are terribly optimized i have a medium grade gaming pc and i have to run on low very low settings to get good frames a medium level of luck is required glitchy mechanics AWFUL vehicle mechanics (eg.*drives into a singular atom explodes*).,Recommended
its alright,Recommended
Great game this is an H1 killer when it done. Honestly a little bit of gun balances and server fixes and this game will be 20x better than H1 can ever be,Recommended
I lik dis gaem lot,Recommended
PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a very strategical game you can play with 1 3 of your friends. Loot spawns at locations and it varies due to the popularity and size of the location. At the start of the game you sit in a lobby with the toxicity of the other players. After a certain amount of time you will be put into a plane which has a random path over the island (Erangel). This is when you figure out where you want to go. Once you find the location you wait for the drop and proceed. When you land you need to find weapons as soon as possible. Check the zone and then if you need to leave it will be smart to find a vehicle. If you don't need to leave you can still find a vehicle but will have more time to loot. At least once during every zone there is an airdrop. These contain high tier loot such as M249's and Ghille Suits. Finding these will give you a very large advantage. While the zones are closing in you need to mind your flanks. Towards the very final zones you need to watch for grenades and people crawling up to you. In the final few you have a pretty good chance of survival. In this game the Chicken Dinner is everything. Get it and get clout. Without it you have no clout. Good luck out there!,Recommended
Awesome stuff aside there are some really frustrating things about this game.Since the new killcam system has been around you can actually see who killed you and how which helps with the frustration of being killed by a pistol assassin from 10 miles away which seems to be impossible. Another thing you might notice is the mind ing lag of the game. Many times looking at the killcam after being killed from around a corner you will see your killer landing shots with his/her recticle not even remotely close to where you are. I'm sure on the other player's screen you are within the recticle but it is frustrating as to constantly be killed when you are actually in cover but to another player you are still in the open.Like a said this little rant is one of the frustrating things in an otherwise awesome title.Will definitely recommend.,Recommended
awesome game good anti cheat,Recommended
One of the best Battle Royale games if not the best one. You start in a plane full of . After a few seconds you will jump out and equip yourself with weapons spread all over the map. The map gets smaller every few minutes so at some point you HAVE TO fight against other people.The map is huge. Literally. You can play with up to 4 people even randoms. It still has some bugs like cars exploding even tho you did nothing. If u want a challenge and still have fun with your friends this game is for you,Recommended
This game is the best I played,Recommended
I was never a big fan of BR games (mainly because I suck at them) but after watching people play this on Twitch and YouTube I thought I would pick up the beta I can honestly say this is the best game I have played in a long time.Yeah sure its not perfectly optimized (the devs have said this is on their to do list and we should expect something in April roughly) but if you can get some decent frames its definately worht picking up. Great game overall.,Recommended
With the exception of Metal Gear I tend to steer away from shooters. However PUBG stands out in the crowd. Reminiscent of Hunger Games do you go to a town more likely to have weapons ( and other players waiting) or do you choose to land in a more (hopefully) isolated area build your arsenal &amp bring the fight to them?,Recommended
One of the best shooting games on the market right now!,Recommended
I've been wanting to get this game for a while now mostly because of my friends and streamers recommending it. I've never played a game like this one and it's pretty damn good. I'm pretty new to it so far so I'm pretty bad but it's also an esy game to adjust to. I highly recommend this it keeps the blood pressure low and it's pretty chill to play.,Recommended
Its pretty fun. It does have some rubberbanding right when the match starts but it typically subsides. The new test branch of the game has major optimization improvements gained about 40fps or so. Ive never experienced any hackers before either. I'm pretty sure most of the negative reviews are from people who arent good or who dont have good internet or a powerful enough machine. I mean it IS early access after all you can't expect superb quality for how relatively new the game is. Honestly it does crash sometimes but not enough that its ruined my experience. Defnitely not perfect but still very fun and absolutely not as bad as some of these reviews seem,Recommended
Great game but has lots of bugs. Hoping for those to be fixed in 1.0 launch.,Recommended
its not good lets be honest,Recommended

Play how you want be it tense firefights or lurking to avoid conflict. Either way this game is undoubtably fun. Still pretty broken but nevertheless it is fun alone or with friends. It's future looks bright as it becomes a more finished product but I recommend you try it now since it will only get better.,Recommended

After 550 hours of a love hate relationship I have finally brought it upon myself to write a review. Gun balancingGun balancing has reached a point where I can actually consider it fair there are some guns that are made completely irrelevant by others like the Scar and M416 or the SKS and Mini 14 but overall the balancing with the ARs and Snipers is done well enough for a game like this. PerformanceTo PUBG's credit performance has actually improved by quite a bit since july of last year (when I started playing it). This of course isn't an exuse for the consistant frame drops in CQC and ADS when near an enemy. The CQC issue has existed since the beginning of this game's release and I have yet to see an actual effort to fix it it's truly painful to drop to 1fps for 3 seconds when you're at point blank of an enemy. Other than this the game will normally keep a consistant frame rate in mid and late game. The new war mode is pretty much unbearable because of extremely low frame rates due to having 100 players in such a small place but it's not yet part of the game so I won't knock them for it. Updates****ing hell do I wish the devs would listen to the community when it comes to adding more content. No one asked you to remove the last event mode. They keep adding new content for custom games which is a terrible decision IMO most custom games are run by twitch streamers that will give codes to their subs first and usually won't play what you want them to play. You shouldn't have to rely on someone else to play the content that blueballs adds. The new shotgun event mode is a step in the right deriction but they lack control over their own games it's clear that the event mode was thrown together in custom games and then ported into the menus as a game mode. All ammo types will spawn in shotguns only because apperantly the devs can't custom set items in their own game. Also we were promised a shooting range 9 months ago and we have yet to recieve one. Custom Games The next time I have to wait for Rahani Gupta to click start on a custom game lobby is when I unistall this game. Brendan Greene must have a daddy kink because he is basically every small PUBG custom game twich streamers . Custom games should have been released for everyone by now BlueBalls entertainment has confirmed that custom games DO NOT run on their own dedicated servers yet we still don't have public custom games. There are literally twitch streamers that survive by linking their streams in the title of a PUBG custom game making you sit through an entire ad to find out the code that probably won't even be there. Just flood the market by making custom games public drive these rats out of your game. This will only hurt those who take advantage of your game as twitch streamers will still be able to create custom games with passwords for their viewers. Final suggestionsPlease just pump out new stuff every week I don't care if you put in an unbalanced weapon it's still content that will bring me back into this game. Pushing out new content and tweaking based on testing will insure that your players will aprove of it when it's finished. I've probably left a lot of things out but this what I think is wrong with the game.,Recommended

Being in alpha this game has quite a few bugs and performance issues (needs more optimization) but these things aside the game is so much fun. Few games will get your heart pounding like this one will. Being in the last 3 survivors in a tiny are in the woods waiting for any sign of movement is intense and the excitement of winning is addicting as hell. RNG can sometimes feel a little unfair but to be honest even though you'll have matches that get you salty getting out and back into a match is so fast its not a big deal when you lose. Game is 10x better with friends too! 8/10 as is mostly because of bugs and crashes that im confident will be fixed by the time the game is released in its entirety.,Recommended
best game ever,Recommended
need improvemnts and game is awesome,Recommended
The game's load screens and project as a whole need to be optimized to reduce load times and the weird habit of needing to reconnect to the game after ever match. Also there seems to be a pattern of the game crashing every few games and not loading in textures or getting stuck loading in textures that will cause the game to crash. Just food for thought for an otherwise fun game to play with your friends online.,Recommended

"7/10 TLDR It's fun with a few friends but it gets annoying because network lag clunky controls and involves a lot of luck (drops circle when you are a certain place). You can get to end game without looting or moving. Basically... Drop out of plane. Run to nearest weapon. Kill. Survive. Loot. Kill till you are the last alive. Plane path is random Loot is random who lands near you *basically random. A lot of ""randomness"" in this game and its frustrating when you dont need a lot of skill to win. The Juicy bits... You feel adrenaline near end game but as you play more and more you dont feel the adrenaline anymore. Killing people is satisfying especially when you snipe them from far away with a silenced 1911 (jk I didnt do that but it would have been cool if i did) Controls The controls feel clunky in the beginning (especially jumping) but you get used to it. Learn to crouch jump trust me it helps out so much. Especially when you are at school because you can jump in and out of windows that people wont expect you to come out of. The more you play the better you get with controlling the character and guns. Vaulting over walls is VERY slow. If you can crouch jump as vaulting leaves you very vulnerable to other players.Overal... After the new update everything is smoother but the vaulting is slow.Pros Killing is always very satisfying in this game Large map and each game is a bit different every timeCons Still unoptimized in some areas of the maps (though its gotten a lot better)",Recommended

Player Unknows Battlegrounds is a very fun game! the controls are easy to handle and the mechanics are easily learnd in a few games. I have made a small list of pros and cons to the game belowPros Immersive and realistic A well developed game (so far please note the game is still being worked on) A very avtive development team constantly releasing information and updates to the game Nice graphics! (even on the lower settings)Cons some may find the $30 pricetag to high for an early access game ( i do understand that the game is still being developed ) if you do not have a very powerfull computer it may be hard to run It can be very frustrating at times e.g. you can be in a game for 20 minutes then just get shot in the head (keep in mind that this is of no fualt of the devs)Overall i really enjoy this game if you are willing to spend the 30$ nad have someone to play it with i would absolutely reccomend it ),Recommended
Fun game microtransactions aren't even that bad.But I really want that mini skirt god dammit I gave you $10 for keys please give me something better than black combat pants.,Recommended
It's a fun game but OMG there are so many Chinese people playing in the North American server!!!! I mean these people are playing in China and speaking Chinese non stop if you are playing in a squad. Other then that it's not bad they just really need to fix that in my opinion kind of hard to work as a team when your team mates all speak chinese!!!!!,Recommended

PUBG is one of those games that can be fun however there are things about it that sannoy as well.The some of gameplay of the game can be fun especially when playing with friends that is when it can be the most fun. However one of the biggest drawbacks would be also be the gameplay this is because due to the programming (although I do know at this stage it is in early access) but some of it doesn't make sense.,Recommended
Additing buggy angering... all and all... great game!!!,Recommended
Great game.,Recommended
I see a lot of potential in this game to be honest I let it sit around in my library for quite some time mostly due how low my frames would get even on low graphics but when I tried the new test server i was able to run at 60 fps on ultra graphics only ocasionally dropping to 55 fps their where some issues with rubber banding in the first minute after jumping but all in all the game feels MUCH more enjoyable than when I first got it in august I have faith this game will only get better with time I think the devs are really tryingP.S. to the people giving negative reviews and saying they uninistalled because they cant get in the second the game goes live due to server issues grow up XD*update I've noticed in 90% of my deathcams the person killing me is firing 10 feet away from my body not sure if it's the deathcam thats broken or netcode is just that ed up if its the first option please fix deathcam so I can actually get a good idea whether or not someone is hacking if its the latter. fix the netcode i dont need to stress being shot 10 feet from your body and getting killed is stupid all in all still enjoy game though. keep trying to polish this baby devs! this game deserves a better rep (and less racists in proxy chat),Recommended
Game 1 Land get hit by carGame 2 Live for a solide 30mins not see a single person top 10 die for some dunb reason.10/10,Recommended
Pros If you like Miscreated Squad Rust ARMA Search and Destroy (Call of Duty) or any game like that then this is the game you've been waiting for. It uses Battle eye for anti cheat. Also unreal engine is used in this game. It's very team based and communication is 100% key to victory. The gameplay including vehicles is very smooth for an early access game which is very promising. So future optimization will only make it better. The game is a nice mix between firefights and being stealthy/ sneaky &amp camping. The way the game is designed prevents people from hard camping which is great. There's no leveling system for your character or attribute points which makes the game 100% SKILL BASED. Game physics is really niceCons Character customization is very limited limited amount of guns (for now many more sure to come) limited armor options (for now more might come)The game has many updates coming into the near future such as being able to climb as well as vaulting walls vehicles and even through a window! Also there will be many more maps as well as different weather! Definitely check out this game don't be surprised if it hits the competitive scene hard as the new main go to game.I will edit my review later to include a nice detailed played in game scenario.,Recommended

Great game fun and stressfull at the same time...,Recommended
While I try not to buy early access games anymore I was peer pressured into this purchase... and boy am I glad!The game is still in a questionably optmized state (FPS is consistent but slightly low some actions feel choppy etc.) it is definitely playable. Furthermore the gameplay that is available at the time of this review is extremely sound with a well designed map for official games. I don't have much experience in solo play but jumping into a match with 3 of your buddies can some of the most fun you can have in a video game today.For the price tag of $30 this game already delivers a solid product even if it was released today. Honestly makes me sad The Culling is dead because the two games have so much in common.,Recommended
Nice game cant wait for more updates and when the full game comes out i can see it being a really good game.,Recommended
I'm just typing this for the badge.,Recommended
If you want a challenge and when i say challenge... i mean turn up your head phones. listen to every single shot. foot step. car. anything you hear is dangerious. patience and really clever thinking will win this game for you.any issue i have i feel dosent justfy a low reveiw because there are still working on the game and it is really good.,Recommended

Immensely fun game with friends.,Recommended
This is a pretty amazing game for this genre. It is familiar and totally fresh at the same time hard to remember when an fps game made me feel that way. Hunger games for PC is easiest reference if you have no idea what this game is. 100 players go onto island play area gets smaller and smaller. Last man standing wins. A lot of the game is about the tension and having no idea if someone is about to blow your head off. The rest of the game is often about not firing your guns and simply staying still lying down on the ground as enemies walk right past you and you feel your heart beat. It took me a little while to really get into it (you just die a lot early as there is no tutorial). Once you push through the early learning phases what lies underneat is fun exciting calming and has a great pace to the games. Suprised me with how fun it got once I was a few hours into playing. Every match begins with jumping out of airplane which is my favorite part of the game as you all race to objectives sometimes you get the gun and blow their head off sometimes they get it. Worth every penny.,Recommended

This is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played. I have played since Early Access and at first I'll admit the game had its issues and I was reluctant as to whether or not it would ever come out of Early Access. I'm glad it has and I will say the development team is very active. But do yourself a favor and grab the PC version.,Recommended
Game I've got most angry at in a while.,Recommended
This is one of the best games I have ever played. I enjoy playing it Solo Squad and Duo with my friends too. It's a great strategy survival game!!!

One of the best Battalroyale games out there!Great community and an awesome game to find friends.Pubg can get frustrating at times due to the bugs glitches and poor performance but with every update the game seems to get better and better.,Recommended
PUBG is still being optimized of course. After a couple months of updates hopefully everyone with budget gaming rigs/ low end pc's will eventually be able to run this game at 50+ fps. Although I am running this game at all low settings with more than minimum requirements to run this game I am still enjoying this game. RN i'm getting around 40 60+ fps depending on where I am. For those of you who barely meet the minimum requirements or are a little over it I definitely recommend you to wait for the game to get out of Early access. Otherwise enjoy the awesome battle royale game this was destined to be. Be prepared for the cancerous community......P.S Don't forget to take off your headset before you go in the plane.,Recommended
it is a solid game. bugs here and there. learning curve is not that great. it is a survival game.,Recommended
Very fun game to play. Even more fun when you play with friends but if you have friends like me someone will die all the time because no one listens and they have to get the loot of the one guy the killed even though they are fully kit already.That is out of the way so onto the game. I had never played a session based shooter like this before. I tried it after watching streams for a few days. I have put a lot of hours into this game since. I enjoy it everytime I play it even when I die right away. Sometimes I jump into busy places just for the rush of get a gun and kill or die other times I jump into an outlying area so I can loot up before I hopefully encounter anyone.The gunplay is fun and types of guns are plenty. If you enjoy shooter games at all you will enjoy this. There are regular updates from the developers and they actually have a target date for official release. I can not recommend this game enough.Fun times!,Recommended
This game has its ups and downs considering all of the bugs but it is still a great buy. Playing with friends on this game is something I have done almost every night since I got it. The game is a five star from me. If you have $30 lying around I beleive it is in your best interest to buy 'PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS'.,Recommended

What can I say about PUBG?Player Unknowns Battle Ground offers very fun experiences for youself and friends i've made countless memories from short hearted defeats victorious wins and even stupid deaths. PUBG is smooth and it runs very well I can Twitch stream 60fps video and still get solid 120fps in game with a AMD R9 200 although I recommend it for someone who can atleast handle 2k 4k games so that you can have a high fps game. Gameplay is good i've met some good people had some good times but it needs some updates. Make a bigger impact between the Vertical Grip and Horizontal Grip because there is no use for the Horizontal. Also make the flash hider an actual flash hider since its not even hidden. PUBG is probably the best game I own other than (league hehe) and I wont be quitting it anytime soon I see a lot of good things the developers can make (possibly a snow map or a map with dynamics ). FIX THE ING GAME THERE IS SO MANY HACKERS. I DIE CROSS MAP FROM A DUDE WITH AIMBOT OR ESP.,Recommended

Game is fun with friends but the occasional chinese hacker who will 3 tap ur head when wearing a lvl 3 helmet from 500 metres away with an S12k shotgun will ruin some of the fun you will have with the game. I'll recommend it IF you have friends to play with regularly but dont get the game at its current state if you are buying it for the solo experience.Also the game is terribly optimised so if you have a weak gpu like my pc you're gonna get around 35 40 fps at the lowest resolution and settings.

Very fun and intense game to play. Especially with friends. This game has a very large skill gap. Takes a long time to get good and learn the gun mechanics. Made tougher by the fact there is no way to practice effectively. Game is full of glitches and bugs but they arent too serious. Since the 1.0 release the game is running a lot better than the early access version and is a joy to play. Nothing beats the suspense and anxiety felt when in a top 10 situation.,Recommended

"Let me start by saying that I do thoroughly enjoy this game and if you're into open arena type games this game is sure to catch your attention. Everything I say is to try to give a completely unbiased opinion to allow outside users to get a feel for what they're getting into.Now... Let me tell you why I absolutely want to break my screen in half over this game. PUBG (PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS) as of right now is unbelievably unoptimized graphically among other things. The balance of the game is absolutely ridiculous when it comes to fairness. I understand that it's a game so it's not going to be realisitc but when someone has a double barrel shotgun with a choke on it can one shot headshot me from down the block after I tagged them with 4 rounds to the chest and they don't even flinch I don't much think that's very fair. Apart from even that imense BS grenades other then the HE grenade is next to useless. Smokes are rarely used and even when they are you don't know which direction the ""wind"" will take it possibly not even providing you with cover to move. Stun grenades are almost non existance in terms of actual play. Graphically speaking the game has major issues with maintaining a constant framerate even in non dense quiet areas meaning no explosions or a bunch of fog or smoke or rain is going on. Server lag isn't a big issue compared to the other problems with the game but at the start where I notice most server lag if you land somewhere with a lot of people and have to quickly grab a gun and fight there's too much delay which could give your opponent a leg up. The sound is way too muffled and faded out and can't usually be made out too well unless it's quiet in the surrounding area. The point system is very unforgiving and can get very frustering.Now that's all said and done I do understand that the game is still undergoing mass changes a lot of updates and fixes which is just ONE reason why I love this game. This game brings so much fun and enjoyment it's hard to step away most of the time. Playing with friends doesn't punish you for goofing around the game itself doesn't limit you on what you can or can't do (Aside from the TOS of course) and it can really make for a lot of good times and goofy moments. If the developers continue on the path they are fixing bugs updating and reworking tweaking just the right way... This game has a very VERY bright future. With all memes aside this game has a long ways to go before it's eSports ready but when it truly is I'm sure it'll be great. MuFFiN",Recommended
Short version As far as gameplay and concept go this game is pretty spot on. It blends excellent gunplay simple yet effective looting mechanics and a beautiful well designed environment to create a heart pounding tactical chess match. While there are still plenty of problems even in the current state it s a great experience. Pros Emphasis on tactics positioning and careful movement without sacrificing good gunplay. Balanced and fun weapons. Risk vs Reward implemented well. Easy to get into games. The game looks great. (I ve been playing on ultra) Very immersive Map size and design. Good level of randomization mixed with the choices of 90ish other players make the game very replayable. Paced well. A full game down to the last player ends up being like 25 minutes. I honestly don t normally make it longer than like 10 15. ctrl t Devs communication. Cons Poorly optimized at the moment. If you re not on a good rig I d wait. Vehicle mechanics are a little wonky. Some weird stuff happens. Occasional bugs. I ve only experienced 1 or 2 that really negatively affected playability. It s not finished ? Addressing some of the concerns that I've seen pop up in other reviews From a technical side there are some issues most of the negative reviews I've read have mentioned poor optimization and server issues and those are definitely something to consider before picking this game up. I'm running it on a pretty high end rig and there are definitely times when the framerate tanks. That being said I've never had it drop below 30fps which I'd still consider playable. As far as server issues I've almost never had any lag or slow downs but maybe I'm just lucky. I also see a lot a people talking about cheaters but can't say that I've ever come across any (yet). It doesn't seem to be plagued with them which was something I was worried about before getting into the game.The vehicle mechanics are pretty bad but I ve also seen worse in finished games. I m excited to see where the devs go with them. The sound is another thing I ve seen talked about a lot. I personally really like the way it s set up and the effects themselves are wonderful. It is very hard to identify where shots are coming from when you re being shot at no denying that but I personally love what it does to the immersion and keeps the game more focused on tactical maneuvering and strategy than strictly gunplay. Anyways I hope this is helpful for those interested. I ve really enjoyed this game and am very excited to see it progress and hopefully improve on it s very promising frame.,Recommended

Great game!! I am playing on a laptop with a core i7 and a nvidia geforce 940mx graphics card and i get 30 40 fps!!So hopefully when the game is realeased i will be able to get over 60 fps!!Just one thing you need to know and that is you need a good computer to play this game with over 60 fps!!Can't wait to the game gets fully realeased this year!!Now i get around 30 40 fps depending what i am doing because i changed the ingame settings a bit and changed the resolution!!And with the people complaing about hackers i haven't encounted one on the game so it must be only on Asia North America and South America!!Also can't wait for the release 7hrs and 30mins to go from 10am,Recommended

"you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3Â½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan Romano &amp Asiago)Note grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling. In a small mixing bowl add the ricotta and mash with a fork. Add in the 3 cheese blend Cheddar cheese eggs salt and pepper. Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth paste like consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough. Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water oil and salt. Mix. Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs water oil and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. Take the dough out of the mixing bowl shape it into a ball and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. With a cookie cutter or upside down water glass cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15 20 dough circles). Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells. Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. Fill a small bowl with water dip your fingers in and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. Fold the dough in half over the filling making a half moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a homemade touch as well. Repeat this process for all your dough circles. Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker. Roll the dough into two sheets Place one sheet on the ravioli maker and form the filling cups. Fill with the ravioli mixture. Lay the second sheet of dough on top and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5 6 minutes or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time you can freeze the rest Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce grate some fresh cheese over it and enjoy!",Recommended

If the players use the cheating programm in normal servers their account will be locked and if they wanna play this game they have to buy a new account and go to the new plays server at the begining instead of the normal servers and protect the the players in the normal servers. and if that works i do believe it will be much less cheating players in normal servers.if you think it is a good idea thumb up please.,Recommended

I very much enjoy this game because of its content. I am able to sit down play with this for hours with my friends or by myself playing this game. I also look towards it's new maps items and even its upcoming vaulting gameplays as well. This game truly deserves a spot for the G.O.T.Y or at least the top 10 games of 2017 by far. I would recommend those who is thinking of buying it you should do it now.,Recommended
review This game is one of the best games I ever played it is really funny to have a good time with 4 friends or less while driving around and tryharding on close rage fights!Allround if you don't have a bad PC or bad Friends you will have a great time while playing this game.

This game is worth the price. It's understandable that it has a lot of bugs as of the moment since it's still incomplete.,Recommended
i love this game and its getting better but fix the god damn cars. i was driving and it just stops and blows up,Recommended
This game is worth every penny. .. my friends just gifted me Sea of Thieves for 60 bucks because I didn't want to pay for something I wouldn't play. This game is half the price and well worth it. IMHO the game became hack infested with tons of cheaters and Bluehole has made great progress taking care of that issue. Now because of the past hacks everyone blames their untimely deaths on cheats or hacks. Take a lesson from ChocoTaco and just remain calm move on to the next round. Appreciation for what the game is... just a game is needed.,Recommended

This game set's the team based games to a higher level.Coordinate strategy applied special ops tactics the list goes on.This game is amazing.,Recommended
I highly recommend this game because it's extremely fun! It is so because the ability to play with friends and go on a ffa against other squads/people is absolutely amazing. Yet this game is an early accessible game which means the gameplay maybe funky at times and you will have a fairly high possibility at encountering bugs but overall this game is immensely great for the stage it is currently in.,Recommended
This game is amazing. been playing it since march and i love the game play and machanics behind it. The thing that i feel would make this better is the latency and tick rates in the servers. Many times i would be behind and object during a fight and somehow i would get a late hit being rejestered. Another thing would be while the RGN aspect is great when it comes to weapons the vehicle spawns are something of a challenge. When the zone is starting to move i spend forever trying to find a vehicle wo make it in but fail to While other times i find 5 right next to each other. So it will feel like to find a vehicle you need to have a vehicle. The last thing is when i comes to shotguns in particular. The shots with a shotgun is the most frustrating thing to me. Close range it should be the most feared and deadly weapon PERIOD! But a lot of the time when i use it close range i have to hit the opponent 3 4 time before they go down and many times i get hit once from a distance and get 1 shotted. Its an incredibly frustrating thing to deal with even if i put a choke on the gun. Other then that this is a fantastic game to play and recommend it with any of my friends.,Recommended

This game is by far the most fun that I have had playing a video game since I got the original Borderlands. Highly recommend for anyone looking to play a casual game play competitively or just with friends goofing around. Now I know.... its still in Pre Release.... Yeah there is that risk but I think anyone that has been playing this game for the last few months can tell you that it has come strides and will only get better!,Recommended
A great game trapped inside a mediocre game.The idea behind the game and the base mechanics are quite fun and this game is great with 1 3 friends.However there are definitely some issues with the game namely (Objective issues) Hackers/cheaters Bugginess (I might never load into the game at all I might get stuck on something in game etc.) Still needs optimization work(Subjective issues) Loot dispersion Game timing Fast paced at the beginning then walking/driving for 10 minutes then fast paced at the end. While this occurs across the board in the BR genre I think it is exacerbated in PUBG. A new 4x4 km map could certainly remedy this situation and is in development.It gets a lot right but it still needs a lot of fixing.I'd still recommend buying it since it's a really fun BR game (and I prefer its style over the cartoonish trampoline shotgun simulator that is Fortnite).,Recommended

This is amazing.Such simplicity that generates such complexity a different adventure every game a different frustration every game you will laugh you will hate you will curse and you will learn how to read others.Cinematic videos in this game that look so fancy are ing real you will do that This is how its done the game came out broken laggy low fps but happen to be that good that people endure all that crap now the game works a little better each time its a slow process but damn these guys and today the game launched as promised.Thanks Bluehole Brendan Greene keep up the good work its better than most money obsessed AAA companies that as a matter of fact never deliver.,Recommended
If H1Z1 worked as intended and DayZ wasn't 90% running in a straight line. Basically everything good about DayZ mashed into a short round of BATTLE ROYALE. Fun solo or fun with friends. A bit demanding on the compooper specs so make sure to see if your machine can handle it. If it can get it it's worth the $$$.,Recommended

208 hours put into the game and am consistantly in the top 3000.My first BR game and I have to say that I am in love with it. If you like shooting games with a sense of strategy involved and are tired of repetitive small map shooters. Fun to play and watch on Twitch. Great with friends fun solo. Very rewarding feeling when you do well(winner winner chicken dinner!) and it's very easy to tell if you are improving. Game is still in early access and still needs some tuning but the devs are always hard at work and are constantly updating and listening to the community! Don't listen to the people whinning and giving the game a bad review because they got banned for cheating/harassing other players. They stream snipe Twitch streamers to kill them and/or harass them in an attempt to ruin the stream and have their 15 seconds of fame. Once these trolls are all delt with the community will be better!I recommend watching Athony_Kongphan and Grimmmz on Twitch if you are looking to get better at the game. Good luck and have fun!,Recommended

I just want to put a positive review on here because yes this game has it flaws its buggy and its performance isnt the best. Buuuut basically everyone putting bad reviews on this game has at least a minimum of 100 hours or more. So you all obvisouly enjoyed the game enough to put a few days of your life into this game. I absolutely love it and ive met some awesome people playing this as well. Ive had problems with loading into the game stupid glitches whle landing and guns not work when i clearly had better postioning. But PlayerUnknown has said on Twitter that they have version 1.0 done theyre just working out the bugs and kinks. So this will be a full release im assuming by the end of this year or early next year. Which is waaaaaaay more progress than DayZ has seen. So i think everyone just needs to quit whinning and enjoy the game for what it is.,Recommended
Wish it wasn't so buggy. Could really be a great game! Hopefully key issues get fixed soon....,Recommended

I've had a lot of fun on this game. It's amazing for what it is and I anticipate it will only get better. There are many super elaborate reviews on here I normally love writing them but I think all that needs to be said at this point is that if this genre of game interests you this is definitely worth a try.,Recommended
This game is fun and worth the $ as long as your computer can support it. I think the best part of the game is playing with friends in squads because gaurenteed there will be tons of crying laughing moments. Best advice for someone on the fence of purchasing the game is to just play it for fun and not get to serious because aimbotters/esp and the works run pretty rampant. All in all it is fun asides from the dweebs that choose to cheat.,Recommended

Sup MuddaFookers Wow what can I say first if you dont play as a smexy waifu your not going to get the most out of this game.If your aim is like hellen keller using a speaker to shoot your just gonna have to camp some small house like a little fajjot till the circle comes in.If your a Pro Gamer (God bless You BTW) you will probably land at school or sum and grab a shotty and shotty some bald looking fook wearing a bright blue shirt.NIBBA THIS GOOD,Recommended

Fun but early access is Low FPS random freezes this program runs to where admin accounts cannot close its process. Wtf?EDIT Still a lot of bugs and weird glitches. They fixed a lot of random freezes still really low FPS. I mean my computer isn't a beast but it can handle most games at 70 120 fps. This thing runs at like 30 max. Program still has privledges that exheed admin levels. I now changed from a NO to a YES it is much more playable. I feel the more the developers put into the game the better it will become. Only time will tell.,Recommended
"I'm SO sick of companies ""early accessing"" games yet I keep supporting them and actually am rarely disapointed. With that said this game has a bit to go but also is the most polished early access game I've supported. I've had so many panic attack inducing hours in solo matches rage quit moments with my best friend in duo and friendship questioning experiences in squads. Seeing Winner Winner Chicken Dinner on screen feels so effing satisifying. Seriously haven't found so much joy in a game in years. This is one of those ""play too late wake up and go to work and think about this game all day go home and jump on and repeat."" games.",Recommended
Packet with action! Solo duo or up to four players in a team. Requires strategy endurance and stamina. Steep learning curve good graphics and is being updated regularly. Still early access but damn worth it!,Recommended

I feel that I have had enough time played on this to write a decent review to describe hoe the game really works. This is a great game a very small percentage of the community is toxic and unwelcoming. But the basics is to fly over a map and skydive into houses loot than and kill other players while trying to out run the blue cricle with slowly kills you. This happens untill you all die. But every part of this game is unique from most titles I have seen out there there are a lot of reliable weapons to choose from and fight with. There are lots of attatchments to perfect your gun the way you like it. There are also hundereds of ways to play it but most people fall into one of two catagories. Those who play to get high kill counts and those who play to win.,Recommended

Optimize Game 9/10,Recommended
Hands down the best game I've played all year.There are bugs. The game crashes. My computer doesn't handle the memory leak very well nor does it really hold up to the demands of the game. But it's playable. It's fun. It's amazing.$30 is a bargain. I bought this game last week and have already played over 30 hours. When I measure entertainment value I compare it to a trip to the theater which often costs $5 to $10 per hour sometimes more if you go for snacks. At that comparison this is the most financially responsible $30 I've spent in a long time.It's still early access and the game continues to improve. With new modes and new maps coming soon I think it's irresponsible not to buy this game immediately if you are even somewhat interested. Get a microphone get 3 friends and go hog wild.I'll be plunking the bats for the foreseeable future.,Recommended
Just to let you know they have disabled family sharing.,Recommended

Great game higly recommend it! immersive gun play tactical gameplay huge open map quick match making acceptable graphics excellent animations Fun multiplayer battle royale experience. Beats H1Z1 King of the Kill in every way. There are a few things that could be improved but with a little more optimization bug fixes and updates this game will probably become my most played game on Steam.,Recommended

I have been surprised by how much I enjoy this game. A friend of mine recommended it to me about a month ago. He said that the game finally got some good updates and made it fun. Loaded it up and I gotta say I am really loving the ARMA Lite experience it gives. There are some shenanigans that I do not like but its a game. It happens. Really liking it. It runs well on my system and it is nothing fancy. A core i5 with a GTX 960. Still needs some work on performance. I am trusting they are going to follow through on that.Game is amazing with friends. Play it with them!Solo 7.5/10Friends 9/10,Recommended
best game ever.,Recommended
After playing both Arma 3 Battle Royale Mod &amp H1Z1 King Of The Kill...I Think PUBG falls right in the middle ground between these games. Arma 3 being to simulated which is not a bad thing mind you and H1Z1 KOTK being far too arcade like. PUBG is a perfect mix of these 2 games being realistic and casual at the same time. Yes the game is early access and tweaks are needed whci the developers work on in weekly and monthly updates and considering the game is not optimised it is alot more optimised since release to early access. I can recommend this game currently as it will be come a big hit once it is finished,Recommended
dont buy this game ok? cuz it very fun and not optimizzzzzed game ok!,Recommended
Not sure why there are so many mixed reviews. This game is amazing especially considering it's early access.,Recommended

This game now works perfectly on my machine. i cant say for sure which one fixed the issue. i am thus changing my vote to a thumbs up because it is a cool game.,Recommended
Not gay.,Recommended
I thuroughly enjoy this game. Im not normally one to like or want to play the 'Last man Standing' type games but this is brilliant. Fun solo but even better with a friend (duo) or friends (squad up to 4). Game can take as qucik or as long as you want it to depending on your play style. So no 'locking in' for a 40minute game if you dont want too/cant aford to time wise. Really excited to see how it develops.,Recommended
I thought this game was trash til I played it lol,Recommended
real good game,Recommended
Awesome game!,Recommended
Do you like Chicken dinners? Cause i love how i serve them up all the time in this game,Recommended
This game is a sincere gem.,Recommended
great game but need to get fixedits getting better but still cant find my self playing it for a long time.,Recommended
Decent game. Needs more focus on client side cheats.,Recommended
Product received for free. Basically you spend 30 minutes killing people and somone runs you over with a goddamn boat.,Recommended
Everyone ing about getting banned stop stream sniping. Problem solved. Everyone ing about game performance turn down your settings it's early access. Everyone ing about server performance yeah that's fair kinda laggy sometimes.Still it's a super fun game as long as you don't run into the occasional cheater everyone with 100+ hours played but then write a negative review are dumb as,Recommended
Pretty good game to play with friends. Especially winning a chiclen dinner!,Recommended
great game hope it improves more,Recommended

good game,Recommended
This is the most fun I had on a game in a while. This game could use a few bug fixes here and there also some god adjustments so it doesn't destroy your computer as much but overall this is my most favorited game other than GTA V.,Recommended
This game has the best melee combat i have ever seen so accurate and detailed,Recommended
Clearly still in development tho. Nevertheless has gotten my heart pumping HARD quite a few times. Totally recommend it.,Recommended
Game is best played with friends. However I find that solo play challenges you the most. Great game I recommend to people who enjoy battle royale style games like H1Z1.,Recommended
Best Battle Royale game i've played so far. The devs know what they do they patch continiously they focus on the current problems and listen to the community.And I bet that 99% of all people that are crying right now because of the crate and key system lost money to it because they are idiots and gambled for a 500 bucks worth skirt.Get the game if your PC can handle it and enjoy it.It's not a game for everyone but you may get the hang of it and enjoy it.,Recommended
After over 200 hours played it is still my go to game on Steam. There are multiple things that still require fixes but overall for a title that is still in early access you cannot do much better. We will see if Blue Hole holds up to their promises for a complete 1.0 version here in December.,Recommended
Brilliant game not come across a hacker as of yet hope I don't have to. A game much like the typical battle royale but with a seeming mix to feel like the hunger games in a way.,Recommended
This game is a reminder that everyone is a hacker or that there is too much lag.,Recommended
BEST GAME EVER!,Recommended
10/10 Best lobby simulator,Recommended
Highly recommend it for sure! All the meds consumable aids weapons and attachments feel extremely realistic and play a huge part in your survival and to get that freakin chicken dinner! There's always a new angle to tackle this last man standing survival game wether it be playing it out slow and waiting your opponents out or balls to the wall till that last little sh$t is dead. Over all absolutely love it and keen to excel in improving my skill and tactics to better that chicken dinner outcome,Recommended

There are many Battleground type games/mods out there. What makes this one special is that it takes aspects that all those games do wrong and fixes them. This results in a great feeling game where guns feel responsive and rounds don't take too long to complete so you can get a couple in during a play session. There are some aspects that i feel could use tweaking but nothing that jumps out at me needing to be completely reworked. I feel like this is a great early access release and i am excited to see wha they do with this game down the road.8/10,Recommended
Product received for free. Really like the game so much ! &lt 3I've been addicted to it since I bought it!,Recommended
To begin with I got pubg because of all the hype that was being developed for the last 4 5 months and I gotta say it really is a great game. Very tactical you need to be focused 100% on the game if you want to take it seriously and it is fun. Taking into consideration that the game is still in early access (and has already broken many records (!) ) the ceiling is nowhere to be found for it. If the devs keep working hard on this game and fix the MMAANNYY bugs that it is currently bothered by it can leave its mark for many years as one of the most popular games out there. It has already re defined the ''Battle royale'' genre of games and I am sure that they won't stop here! Buy it fearlessly but you should be ready to face some annoying bugs and performance issues. (That's the meaning of early access though cannot complain!),Recommended
fun to play......if u r winning,Recommended
This game is the best early access game i've ever played. They release updates constantly and work on bug fixes as a priority. If you have been thinking about getting it just do it you wont be dissapointed. Prepare to get rekt at first but with some practice and patience you'll be getting chicken dinners in no time. I reccomend playing with friends at first or joing one of the discord groups dedicated to this game. It is a blast with other people and I have made some good friends playing this game with people from those groups.,Recommended
Extremely addictive and fun but terrible optimization and a lot of hacking asians.,Recommended
"A Team Based Adrenaline Pumping Action Packed Battle Royale Game MeThose would be the words I would use if someone would ask me to describe this game. Whether it be watching my friends drive and flip into a pillar only to explode by the red zone or speeding past bridge campers on a bike wildly shooting back to save myself PUGB is filled with enough encounters and moments that will always be either the scariest or the funniest memories of this game.The backlash that PUGB has recieved though isn't completely unwarrented. The community has continued to discuss about a wide range of issues in the game such as hackers bugs and computer inconsistancies and for the most part they have the right to say these things. Personally I've had none of these community issues. I run the game on the minimum requirements and play on Oceania servers and so far I have no complaints. I haven't encountered and ""Chinese Hackers"" and performance wise I simply suck it up knowing that my 5 year old GPU is to blame and keep playing.With all the complaints I believe that PUGB's hard work with the game is being overlooked. They've worked to ensure that this game doesn't end up like DayZ or Halo The Master Chief Collection high profile games that were essentially abandoned simply because of the lack of innovative fixes/too big of a project to complete in the timeframe given.All said I'd recommend you play this game with friends. Create your own experiences scale mountains loot towns experience intense firefights while juggling with supply and teammate management. Enjoy the ability to gain loot boxes that can be sold for very good prices (for now).Enjoy the game. It's only going to be getting better.",Recommended

10/10 love to loot for almost 15min to walk in to someone's house whilst he is hiding in a corner with a shotgun,Recommended
"From the first day this game was released it looked like a lot of fun. People started recording it and uploading it on the Youtubes. The game legit looked and sounded really really fun. After a while of waiting for the game to get some bugs fixed I decided to buy the game I couldnt wait anymore. From the start the game seemed really really sick. The graphics looked nice the music the HUD everything. We got into a game and intantly died (the usual) and we were too hyped to stop. Second or third game in is when things started to roll down hill. Me and my friends couldnt start a game because the game auto cancelled our game and we were confused. We decided to hop into the Eu (usually NA) servers and played fine for a bit and then it happened. ""Network Lag Detected"". If you get this game expect to see this A LOT. The game is still in beta and is still getting fixed. I went on the forums on the interwebs and tons and tons of people are experiancing the same issues as everyone else. Again this game is in beta it needs time to fix and perfect. Although the game has its issues its super fun to play. Dont be discouraged! Time will come and this game will be legendary!",Recommended
Rendering issues for houses and walls mostly everything when i spawn in and jump out of the plane when i land nothing renders properly it takes about 3 5 mins before the textures are rendered and i can finally move its a shame because its a great game just this is a really big issue and needs to be fixed asap,Recommended
Better than CS GO. Yeah I said it.,Recommended
I do not really understand all the negativity around this game unless it's about hackers. I get that some people have problems with bugs and I do too trust me. But to say that the developers do not know what they are doing is IMO a joke. This game has been in early access for less than a year and they are set on releasing the full 1.0 version tomorrow. This is still impressive and a breath of fresh air when compared to other Early Access games. (day z for example.) They have improved the stability and performance a lot since the release and in my opinion the game is very much playable even on the test servers except the rubber banding. For me personaly I have not encountered a single person hacking in this game yet. I don't know if I am lucky or not but I guess this problem is more apparent on the US and the Asian servers and not the EU. I think the team has made great progress so far. When the game hit 1.0 tomorrow the team will most likley adress all the stability issues that we may encounter and not focus on new content. Early access is just not a funding campain. It's more aimed at getting the minimal viable product to the hands of the customer and then let people play and give the developer feedback so the game gets better. A lot of games get stuck and sometimes for understandable reasons. Some developers just wanna make money on the trend. But Bluehole has in my opinion made a fantastic game that has more potential than the majority of Early Access games.,Recommended
In my opinion this is the best game of 2017 and it's not even close. The perfect blend of ARMA 3 BR DayZ and H1 elements. No games get my heart pumping like a final circle in PUBG. Development is fast updates are frequent they are always adding more and more to the game as well as slowly bringing along optimization which is to be expected. The game already runs pretty great for me as is though. I've been playing PUBG since alpha back in I think November '16 and it's insane to look back and see how far it's come along in only just over half of a year. Can't wait to see where this game goes. I know a lot of people reviewing this game recently seem to care alot about the crate system and broken promises. Personally I could not care less. I don't plan on buying crate keys much if ever and I can't see myself using any of the current cosmetic items in those crates. I'll leave my enemies to wearing the yellow jackets and skirts that show your legs by all means. Not to mention once first person servers have all the kinks worked out and are stable its the only mode I plan to play so I'll only be seeing my gloves. The only people I would not recommend this game for are people who can't control their gambling urge or money in general because I know that's a slippery slope for some. Overall I love this game and I hope to see it thrive. 10/10,Recommended
The game is the most fun but more fun with friends,Recommended
First Off I Would Like To Say This Game Is Amazing And This Is One Of The Only Times I Write Reviews.(Pros) ING EVERYTHINGGuns And Loot AmazingHit Boxes Are On PointMap Is Massive And Always Changes The Tide Of Battle Due To The Circle Changes.(Cons)Could Use More Guns.SNIPERS ARE ING EVERYWHERE BUT YOU CAN NEVER FIND A SNIPER.Only 1 map and the Devs are planning on making 2 more but they should make like 50 morelong awaited updates seem almost nonexisting but promised 10/10 would rub some bacon on it,Recommended
Amaazing game ever,Recommended
Love this game. So enjoybale when u play with a Full squad. Every match offers a different ending and a different scenario which is why this game is shaping up to be one of the most outstanding game in the Battle Royale genre. Currently the peak players are 13 million which is increasing day by day. This game is not ending anytime soon. Infact there is only 1 map still the player base is rising and Community is loving the game. Now why is this game getting huge success despite Zero marketing?*Heart pumping moments*Satisfying Wins*Good optimization*Overall balance of Weapons *Different match offers different scenarios (which is why I can't get over this game)*Patches with huge fixes every month*A great map and more comingA must buy game with the price D,Recommended
A game that as far as im concerned will just keep getting better and better.,Recommended
In PUBG you will have an experience diffrent from all others. This game is amazing. The people that you meet (team wise) are amazing with all of my time in duos i've only meet 1 bad person. I highly suggest this game.,Recommended
It's better than h1z1,Recommended
Great community.,Recommended
Really fun game for a fair price. I don't get all the negative reviews. Regarding the comments about bad performance I'm playing on maxed out settings on a pretty normal gaming rig with a GTX 1060 (which is by no means an overpriced graphics card) with no issues at all. Yes the graphics are not that good even on ultra this is an early access game though. If you expect a great looking game without any bugs whatsoever just wait for the release. It may be overhyped but still It's a ton of fun and the gameplay is good. I love it for it's casuality and the ability to play solo since I don't always want to wait for friends or play in a team with people I don't know that are constantly whining in VC about other players just because they're so scared of loosing a few virtual ranking points in a videogame. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes playing multiplayer shooters. I do hope they fix the discussed problem with streamers and server bans though since I like the game and I don't intend to stop playing anytime soon.,Recommended
Drop down from a plane into an island turned into battleground with 100 like minded killers.See others open their parachutes and fly towards same abandoned house you intented to loot. You are seconds ahead of them as you land and bolt towards the door. Theres a weapon on the floor you grab it load it and turn around and bam! You open fire and manage to take him down. Now the REAL Challange to be the last one alive begins!Adrenalin pumping from having bullets whip and crack past your head.PUBG is really fun to play. It's the best selling game on steam for a reason.,Recommended

Great game it maybe costy for some people like me cuz im super budget about stuff but i think its worth the full price to be very honest you will not win every single game because of alot of factors and you may win every gun fights but you still will get sniped by some people far far away overall i cant snipe and i find it fustrating but its still a fun game especially when you win or get into top 10 for me personally on any mode aslong as im in top 10 i count that as a win 3,Recommended

Many people are complaining abouth the apparently rampant issue of being banned but i have not tun into this issue. Apart from this the game is very good has few glitches compared to other early access games and has really addictive gameplay. Reccomended that you play with friends. 8.5/10.,Recommended
fun and addictive,Recommended
In these almost 50 hours I've spent in this game I have yet to face any server/queue/matchmaking issues and perhaps like 95% of the time was spent actually playing the game so that's definitely a positive start. Regarding actual gameplay there are a lot of bugs I can't deny that however they're minor and have no impact on the ability to play the game and enjoy the core idea of this game. The real gameplay excluding the bugs is what makes this game stand out in BR scene it has a lot of depth (plenty of things you can do with different tactics smokes hearing other people staying in the shadows etc.) in my opinion close to a perfect combat system (can't even compare it with h1z1) and these are the things that I consider high end priorities for such game.,Recommended
First off I can see why this game has negative reviews...In order to enjoy this game you need friends or a group of people that all talk.If you have no communication you will not enjoy this game.Second You won't be good at it right away... It takes a few hours to get used to this type of game and ifyou're used to playing call of duty or similar titles play this game in first person. You'll have a huge disadvantage if you play in third person.Once you get used to the gameplay and have decent people to play with this game is loads of fun!I have not experience very many performance related issues the odd stutter or FPS drops here and there no latency issues here like many people have commented. I personally advise you TURN OFF vsync no matter what GPU you use it drops your framerate dramatically don't know why. I have a 144hz monitor and it cuts my frames from 125 down to 85 if enabled.,Recommended
This is what I've been looking for in a shooter. Something I can pick up run around have fun get shot and quickly start a new game. Play with a headset to get a better idea of where shots are coming from. Great fun so far! Looking forward to new maps in the future but that being said this is gonna be fun for a long time to come.,Recommended
The Game is some what a Triple A tittles with it s lage map and vast area of playing field the game play is up to the player. with every week a new update arise the community helps the beta testing insuring seamless gameplay in live servers.

Landed in the military base off of the coast. Escaped heavy gunfire from enemy squad. Run through a battle zone to a team of all non English speaking players. Find a buggy and drive away. Find a jeep. Exchanged buggy for jeep and drive back to pick up my team before the blue death sets upon us. Arrive and gesture with avatar to get in. I'm greeted with loud and angry Chinese chatter followed by an awkward pause. No one is getting in the jeep. However I do get shot in the face with a Kar98. The rest of my team now opens up on me like a firing squad. As the screen fades to black I see my so called mates picking my corpse for guns and supplies. What the is this game???,Recommended

I saw this game announced some time ago and I was pretty hyped but seeing the streams and videos didn't make me buy it instantly. When I had the occasion I gave it a try and I was pretty impressed and satisfied by that game.

Absolutely irritated at the fact that it supports a controller for game usage but has NO controller settings. My sensetivity on the controller is very high. On a scale of one to ten I play with a sensetivity of 4. My sensetivity is baseline 8 and I can't change it. Until I can change my x and y axis senstivity I don't think I will be playing much because it becomes a waste of my time to build up gear and then die cause I either severely over or undercorrect my aim. Your survival becomes a matter of luck more so than skill. will start recommending when I have controller support.Update. The controllers are very comfortable for me now but I found a work around using steam controller settings in combination with the mouse and keyboard settings. using the steam controller settings I adjusted to a semi comfortable custom x and y axis settings. then I go in game and adjust the base settings for the game for each kind of scope. so its very customized to my liking. very much ove the game and would recommend. although there are a few new issues as the game updates I will mention elsewhere.,Recommended

I have 95 games in my inventory and have played video games since the 70s. 12 years on Steam alone. This game stands apart from many other games I've played in the excitement and incremental stress (good kind) that comes from a well developed concept and exciting gameplay. I gave a ton of my time to DayZ in hopes that it would produce this kind of outcome. I love the open world and personal tactical choice for style of play. The Devs are really on to something with this game. For those who enjoy either open world or shooters this has something to offer for both. Im a fan so far. 2 thumbs up.,Recommended

Keep doing the great stuff ! Nice game!,Recommended
I really did and still do enjoy this game and its concept as well as gameplay however just like EVERYONE else playing it is extremely frustrating running into (most commonly chinese) hackers. When you take the time to play correctly moving circle to circle aqcuiring kills and gear only to have LingLing253 or XiongFeng 858 stand on top of a hill somewhere and do a short birst in several directions from the hip and score a half dozen kills and ruining the fun the legit players are having then you need to take a good look at your game. Reporting them seemingly does nothing as its getting more and more common there needs to be some feedback on the tickets weve opened against these cheating players or maybe just a chinese only server where players like this can behave this way against like minded players that want to cheat against one another. These players are laughing at the rules youve put in place and the legitimate players need to know something is being done.,Recommended
I've died more flippping vehicles than getting shot. This game is god's final work.,Recommended
A nice game with a huge potential. Once optimized hella fun. Now the little things sometimes bother way too much and lead to frustrating rage quits. Best suitable for playing with a bunch of friends IMO. Whether hunting for that chicken dinner and playing extra passive to just in' around it's best experienced with a friend or two.,Recommended

(for me atleast lol)animations are incredible.fun to play with groups.THE PAN!!! THE PAN IS MY SAVIOUR.Con'snetwork lag.. its so annoying in game lol.in game glitches.,Recommended
It's a difficult one. You have a game thats simple to it's core and yet so much fun! But it is hugely un optimized and the lag desync etc is unreal plus it's always fun to blast someone close range with a shotty and it not register ). If they fix these core performance issues this game will last a long time if they don't it's for sure not worth 28 pounds. Wait and see what happens before purchase. P.S I have heard a lot about cheaters but only experienced the odd one or two. People tend to slap a cheat tag onto anyone for a good shot.,Recommended
Love the game cant wait for it to get out of the alpha,Recommended
Really nice game 70 hours now played nonstop.If you like battle royale games this is one you should really play big open map find the best loot you can and surviving till the end gives so much satisfaction.Keep in mind it's early acces so the optimizations are not what you expect it can be laggy and buggy at the start of the game but during the game it's smooth with not too many problems. Buy it if you wish to support the devs. It's only early acces and it's already that good what's it gonna be when it's released?,Recommended

Fun to be playing with friends still got some bugs here and there but at least they updating it and goes out from early access.,Recommended
I like this game because I like bugs.,Recommended
) good,Recommended
I own a couple of games that offer similar experices to this one being H1Z1 King of the Kill'On the face of it the games sound the same. You parachute onto the map land get gear and destroy the opposition. You have to collect weapons armour meds and more just to ensure you make it to the end. BOTH games offer this style of play. But make NO mistake the games are worlds apart. H1 Z1 feels much more like a lower end copy (even though PUBG was released after) PUBG offers a better experiece in my opinion mainly as you can have varous scopes grips and gear that H1 Z1 lacks. PUBG also feels more polished and well produced. It's still in the early days yet but the game itself is a lot of fun. I'd advise playing with friends if you can as random groups can be a pain. Lots of John Rambos thinking they can hop and dodge bullets. Crazy.The price difference between H1 Z1 and PUBG is pretty steep. But comparing the two side by side you'll see why! Defo pick this up when you can play with mates and give Stonemountain64 a watch. It's amazing. Solo play is also fun and you really do get scared when you hear opponants around. Absolute blast and the recent update just makes it better.H1 Z1 4/10PUBG 7.5/10 and climing as things get better.The PUBG Sales figures speak volumes. Buy it.,Recommended
best game to spend few hours.....oh wait i been playing it all day now... well worth it &lt 3,Recommended

This game is extremely fun. After hours of playing this game just gets better and better. After a while you start loving this game. Sometimes it gets glitchy but I blame that due to the fact that it is still in the Early Access stage. When the full release comes this game will be amazing. I guarantee it.,Recommended
I loved this game when i first got it just a couple months ago. But for some reason it has completely gone to not that the game itself is bad but simply unplayable without restarting the whole game a dozen times until it will actaully load you in AND allow you to do anything.Even the menu has trouble loading now and I am amazed that this counts as an improvement to the game. I have searched for reasons for my trouble and have only found earlier complaints. I would still like to continue playing but i would suggest that they hand the game off to someone who knows what theyre doing or simply do their jobs and make it playable again.Keep in mind that i have brought all settings to their lowest and have even sacrificed my resolution with no improvements whatsoever.,Recommended

I just say this is the ultimate Bear Grylls simulator. It is pretty good when you have played it a while.

But its pretty gud get it!,Recommended
HARD BUT AWSOME,Recommended
AA,Recommended
Decent game just got a lot of hackers recently hopefully it'll be fixed soon. Once they do optimize the game fully as well it will make the game really good but for now it's really decent besides the annoying hackers otherwise i'd call the game a 8/10 for now.,Recommended
So yeah. It's pretty fun.,Recommended
Really fun. 10/10 Would recommend.,Recommended
Fun and Challening for you and your PC. Serious note A++ game.,Recommended
The game will make you angry and want to destroy your pc. It will make you want to cry yourself to sleep. But there's a reason I keep coming back. It's a good ing game. I highly recommend playing with friends. It's much more fun to be part of a unit where you can make jokes while running to the next circle but know they'll have your back when hits the fan. YES there are still gliches in the game. But the developers listen to their players and it is partially why it is only $30. My rating 4.9 Bald Vin Diesel Heads out of 5,Recommended
This game is fun. If you have friends. To shoot. Or if they run you over.if you dont have friends then this game is not fun.,Recommended
This is so funny to play alone and with friends recommended to every1,Recommended
Fun adventure before you get killed but even failure doesn't void the experience. It's fun especially with a friend.Watch out for people with 800+ hours.,Recommended
This game is thrilling. You drop into the unknown with 99 other people all unarmed. You battle for survival using your fists or whatever you can lay your hands on. Spend 15 minutes collecting gear protecting yourself until the mysterious blue zone pushes you out of your house. The light is so bright... then you get shot in the head. GG,Recommended
This game is so ing good. Its so fun to play with friends and its so fun to play solo! I recommned this game to everyone I promise you guys its worth the amount of money! Have a nice day! ),Recommended
Great game!,Recommended
Overall a great game but it's bad when it comes to matchmaking cause when you try to get into squads all you get are a bunch of Asians who speak a totally different language than english in your North American server. It's impossible to communicate and even harder to hear since they have their mics on open and are constantly talking. If you can keep people in their own regions of the game it would make it a lot more fun to play with others but you are constantly stuck with your friends cause you have them or the screaming asians you choose.,Recommended
great game pretty demanding on graphics but very fun.,Recommended
Love this game,Recommended
10/10 would watch again IGN,Recommended
Want a nice juicy chicken dinner? Well then you have found the right game. Whether it be by yourself or with 3 of your closest friend or maybe you even want to learn some Chinese in the North America server for a couple of rounds with some random people. Either way this game will give you constant entertainment for hours on end. You want to run up to someone and beat them to death with a pan...or maybe you want to watch a Dacia 1300 backflip in the air only to get killed by a flying buggy in the corner of your eye? Then this game is for you. Anything is possible in this action packed world of PUBG. Good luck out there you will need it.,Recommended

The definitive battle royale experience. Even in (very) early access this game runs smoothly and the gun physics (for the most part) are pretty much on point. I can only see this game getting better over time.,Recommended
great game,Recommended
With the new 1.0 update i can finally run pubg at constant 60+ fps on high settings with my i3 8100 and gtx 1060 3gb. My main problem with this game was with its very poor optimisation however now that it has greatly improved the only nit pick I have is with its servers sometimes i find myself rubber banding more than i'd like.Overall fantastic game and would reccomend it to anyone from the casual gamer to the hardcore e sports one.,Recommended

This game is freaking amazing! It is so much fun! Especially when you play with friends! The developers really listen to the players which is great! People give it so many bad reviews for bugs and yes there are bugs but at least for me they don t occur that often and the developers always try and fix them as soon as possible. I mean it s hard not to have bugs in a game like this with how huge the map is and everything but this game is definitely worth the money and it s amazing!,Recommended
The game is awesome and is being polished with every patch. Highly recommend it!But its not well optimized at the moment sadly. You die instantly when u jump out of a car that is barely moving. And you need a good run up to jump over fences but they said that vaulting and jumping over walls/fences will be implemented soon.At the moment I give a 8/10.,Recommended
Game is pretty good. There is just few problems 1. Cheaters and legal cheaters. This second bought a mouse with included non recoil button macro. Easy pizzy full auto shooting on mid and mid long distans without recoil or its absend.2. If people purposly play on different region to have ping 200+ ms should be kicked from match.3. Some little bugs but its everywhere so...4. Should be button to report people who jump to squads and dont play with squad ),Recommended
Just buy it and have fun.,Recommended
Really enjoying this game. New twist on first person shooter. Ready for new maps.,Recommended
You press &lt F&gt to get in the car. Nope The car it's gonna fly away.You hit a tree with the car.

So far this game is great,Recommended
"PUBG.... where do i start with this game? Still in early access but has around 2 million concurrent players. Even I have to raise my eyebrow and question how thats possible. But nonetheless playing the game all makes sense its something that can have you going for hours the intense final zone gun fights playing with a squad and corridinating attacks or even as simple as looting a house and finding a level 3 vest. There arent many games that take the same ""genre"" as Pubg there arent many battle royal shooter as successful as pubg. Sure you have Arma and maybe some other ones but those games are too hardcore for casual audience. But this this game is a mixture of hardcore and easy going something both pro players like Shroud can enjoy and something a new newbie starting out can also enjoy. To conclude if you dont have this game in your steam library then you dont have complete game collection this game is worth the however much it costs (even if it cost 60$ i'd get it and for me thats pricy) and it'll get you doing hours on end.",Recommended
lit game,Recommended
This game has it's issues. It does. One game you are maxing out on FPS the next you're struggling to hit 30.There was a huge problem with hackers for a while. There are still some roaming around.Stupid playzone ALWAYS HITS THE FREAKING MILITARY BASE WITH BRIDGE CAMPERS OMG THIS GAME IS BADI still play pretty much every night. This game deserves it's Game of the Year award. I enjoy it every time I play it even if I get mad from some bull event.Every game has their issues. But this game has drawn me in more than any other. For that I recommend playing it!,Recommended
This is a good game that has improved a lot it's now decently optimized not in early access and most of the bugs are gone. I'm proud of the devs for fixing their game. Just make it on sale Bluehole.,Recommended
This game is quite nice MMO aspect is good Just add more contents to this masterpiece. _,Recommended
Dats is gud,Recommended
PROS Fun gameplay Addicting Hillarious community Winning will make you hooked Character customization CONS Bad optimization Players from China are in every server you cannot escape them. You're not a Chinese player on a team full of Chinese people? Team killed. Hackers here and there nothing to crazy though.,Recommended
wow the game is awesome and such a great graphics but game need some optimization,Recommended
so gooooooood,Recommended
So this game is kind of in the middle for me between liking and hating it. On one hand I think that this is the superior Battle Royale game to Fortnite because there's less cheaters and it just feels more fleshed out. Fortnite was never really meant to be a Battle Royale game anyways they just jumped on the cash cow when they saw the PUBG success. And on the other hand this game has had a LOT of players from China whom hack frequently and never really seem to be dealt with accordingly. I don't know I would watch gameplay of this game and think if you might get into this genre. I can't say i'm too fond of it but I see why people like it.,Recommended
To start off this game is far from perfect. It is really badly optimised and has problems with lag spikes and generaly low fps even on the lowest settings however the devs have stated that they are prioritising the optimisation of the game which i'm glad about. I have on multiple ocassions experienced crashes in the game and massive server lag which was not on my end because other people in my group were also experiencing the same thing. However flaws aside the gameplay is some of the most intense and fun that i've experienced in a long while the guns have a satisfying feel from the recoil and sound combat feels solid and almost arma like minus the janky movement xD. I've been playing this game for over 9 hours and I can tell you that I barely sleep anymore the amount of times you will be telling yourself that you'lle only play one more will amaze you 4 hours will pass you like a breeze. Overall as long as you have a decent PC and are looking for one of the or if not the best battle royale game out there then I definitely recommend buying this game.,Recommended
Pew Pew,Recommended
Began yesterday 10pm stopped today 6am let's do same tonight already 10h play x) Great game hope it'll go further,Recommended
Please push out Chinese Server ASAP!,Recommended
Maybe you need to update more your security for players who are hacking. Its really making this game bad when you play w hackers. I hope you get to check those who were repetitively reported by most players. I hope you got to make a move about this.,Recommended
after the update today the game crashes everytime i find a match. there's an error everytime i send a crash report. please fix this. it never crash since this update launched,Recommended

This game is amazing and extremely fun! i recomend everyone buying it its addictive and awesome to play with friends but solo is very cool too and if u like H1Z1 or another Battle Royale game u will love PUBG.The negative points is that the game isn t optimized yet which is kinda lame cuz i have the requirements but sometimes i go to 20 fps but besides that the game is awesome(I recomend u buy from cdkeys cuz the game there is 22 ),Recommended
i love this game,Recommended
It's ok,Recommended

game is just too much fun!!,Recommended
Will never be #1 10/10,Recommended
This game looks highly promising main issues currently are HARDWARE OPTIMISASTION and HITBOXES im getting 40 60 fps on a GTX1070 &amp 6600K rig but only 8GB RAM (may be the problem) with small drops here and there in cities.Pros EXCELLENT &amp REALISTIC gun play ABSOLUTLEY BLOOD PUMPING there's barely any rest and you can get killed unexpectedly. Always assume someone sees you and plan acordingly. SOUND is really nice gunshots and steps vary according to the gun you have and footwear respectivly. SUPPRESSORS are NOT so OP and are very balanced. Gun Costumization is really nice realistic as well. ADDICTING! Especially with a Team or a Duo. Only 1 MAP which is a good thing it's 8Kmx8Km (HUGE) not randomly generated but loot spawns is random so it Doesn't get boring at all. Graphics are nice 7/10 ish. Gets updated almost Daily Devs are very caring and constantly working on Improvments. Potential is THROUGH THE ROOF just give it time it'll be #1 on ratings and sales. No gun is really OP everything's balanced here. though shotguns will make you a winner in early game CQB.Cons Framerate is really bad as of now better OPTIMISATION is the solution and it'll get better for sure with time. UE4 is known to have some problems with non AAA games that don't have lots of devs working on it. (though playing on low medium settings give you some kind of an advantage when in tall grass and far distances. HITBOXES are kinda as of now. but it's no thing that can't be fixed. Bugs are present but not so critical it happended once to me when the buildings and any artificial monuments just Don't render and i could see loot through everything. a restart solved it though. Short range gunfights feel a bit odd and wierd for some reason i can't point my finger at it exactly though.*my experience Laying prone with a 4x scope on an SKS looking down a tall hill gave me deja vu from the original OP.Flashpoint times for some reason. made me have a big smile on my face although i was getting pinned and scared . Situational Awareness Planning Ahead Cooperation Callouts Effective use of Cover and keeping CALM are key! use the Compass as frequently as posible! Holographics sight and Red Dot feel differently at different ranges and i find the HOLO sight's reticle to be better for me but the sight's body obstructs my vision a bit so i'd rather play safe and use the Red Dot when i can. Prefer A Shotgun+AR instead of 2 ARs! also pistols can be life savers! Frying pans can litteraly save your even if you dont use them! prefer a UAZ car instead of a buggy. Don't try your luck in the RED (Bombing) zones find a house and stay in the first floor. don't take items that you don't need! for Ex. don't take 9mm or .45ACP if you have an M16 and a Kar98K and no pistol. So to conclude i REALLY liked the game and i'm really looking forward for better performance. can't wait to see more features in the future!THANKS FOR READING! D,Recommended

Definitly needs optimization and I wouldnt recommend buying this game if your computer only meets minimum specs trust me. performance aside tough its a really fun game and a solid PvP experience that I look forward to playing lots more of once my new processor arrives. if you have a good PC and like the idea of this type of game its well worth your time.,Recommended
For a game that is still in Early Access I would 100% recomment for anyone looking for a solid shooter to play. Keep your expectations low because it is again not released as a full game. But please look forward to any and every update in the future. I was never a big fan of shooters in general but PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was able to sell itself to me. I hope most of the existing issues will be resolved by launch. Keep up the good work Bluehole.,Recommended

Best game I've ever played! Just got the game a few weeks ago and already love it! Most of the time I play squad mode with my friends. Whenever i play with a random on the other hand I always get paired with some chinese or korean guys. To make a long story short last time I played duo with a chinese guy he started screaming at me for not reviving him10/10 wouldn't revive him again,Recommended
People shouldn't downvote because they have awful laptops. This is the most fun game I have played since CS on it's release.,Recommended

Literally the most fun game I have ever played. Never have I ever had the urge to produce so much speed violence and momentum all at the same time for such an extended period of time.,Recommended
Hard to describe this one. Good game however extremely similar content to what we have seen in the past from www. .com. Lots of wide eyed that like to immigrate to my server to hack but hopefully after brexit takes full force we will stop that. First person provides a solid genuine FPS feel for players however it also creates the feeling of being sexually assaulted when you get shot and you start jumping around like a kid who just found out he has autism. 6/5.final notes remove that ing desert map or i will come to bluehole studios and wank over the map designer's desk.,Recommended
Product received for free. good game,Recommended
*!! Recomnded for now will probably change in about 6 months Other battle royale games are improving This game died when it try to re sue fortntie and other games because they think they own the genre of battle royale No good improvements other than a few new weapon changes and some sound/optimization changes. I presumme this game will be near death in around 6 months or less !!*Should you play fortnite or pubg probably fortnite or just get this on mobile if you can as it is free. The devs have done not a lot with this game in months its mostly the same game at launch just some loot changes and 1 new map and another new one to come out soon.Also with pubg trying to sue fortnite not the best idea it seems childish.As a battle royale game the reason this game works so well compraed to other games is that you are always finding loot and being pushed to the center of the circle. Always being forced to move and the random loot and a lot of different loot makes it interesting and fun. Being only pvp with no pve also helps.Amazing Game can be boring depend on how you play i advise not to camp (staying in the same spot) and also looking for loot makes it easier for late game with better equipment. You find random loot in random places after jumping out of the plane. You move to the designated circle and if you do not decide to move quickly even way before the circle gets near it can creep up on you.,Recommended

Well... I love this game its super fun and u can play with friends. I would recommend this game but theres aw problem if u wanna have good fps then u need something better than the minimum requierments I have a GTX 960M Intel Core i5 6300 and 8GB RAM and thats not enough (20 30FPS) but i saw some videos on YT and got the FPS up tp 30 40 FPS and thats not enough either but its MUCH more better.

Have you ever played H1Z1 king of the hill? I know I did and it was a trash game. This game is now a way cooler version of that. Its got Arma play style. Its got solo duo and quad teams. Game has no aim hacks im sure there is script hacks for players and loot but they still suck at the game. All in all 9/10 for a game. could improve on start up match area audio problems and maybe some less load pc on player air drops. yes my pc is crap i5 650 3.2Ghz dual core cpu gtx960 gpu. the game runs some what good 20 in harsh area 30+ fps in less areas,Recommended

Right straight away you're gunna need a good rig to run this boemeth of a game because it isnt optomised enough to run on rigs like mine well enough. I mean I run everything on High with GTX 1050 Ti and still get 60 FPS but I do have problems rendering because of the lack of VRAM. But all things aside it's a phenomal game and has grew so quick its broken recoords it's muched loved in the streaming community and just a lovely game to play. Loot as quickly as you can and fight the adrenaline and the anxiety listening out for nearby players. I'd reccomend to anybody. But One it needs to come out of the never ending Alpha Phase rather than been an umpromising Alpha always title. Hopefully it's Console releases at the end of the year give it good enough PR to get it going to a full release.Improvements Optimizations Better Servers and NET Code Response Times (Ties in with better Net Code) Wide range of loot.,Recommended

Before we start this If you haven't done so already Try the test server of this game. New lobby music. New UI. Better performance. It's just beautiful.I've played more than a hundred hours on this game and I don't regret it. The game is in Early Access for a reason. As it's not suitable for all PCs. But the concept of the game itself is a revolution to the gaming industry. (Yes I'm aware that H1Z1 existed long before this But heck out how many games similar to PUBG have been made after it's release) For those who never played the game I'll try to explain it as briefly as possible 100 people on an island with guns armor and vehicules in a 10x10km map. The play area (safe area) gets smaller over time forcing players to fight.,Recommended

Rewriting my Review since the game has released from Early Access.Let me first start off by saying that the sheer number of negative reviews occuring right now are claiming the game is PLAGUED with cheaters. It is not. Many players are either not used to a Military Sim shooter or rely 100% on the 'deathcam' footage as proof that someone cheated (fun fact kill cams have never been accurate since CoD did them). The whole 'this person killed me so they must be cheating' mentality is attrocious in this day and age. I don't care how long you've been playing shooters you're not immortal. The time to kill in this game is fairly quick and at least 90% of your deaths are going to be your own fault. Bad positioning bad use of mechanics bad map and surrounding awareness bad shooting poor decision making. This is NOT a Call of Duty shooter stop treating it like one this game requires a good deal of tactics and understanding to secure wins often.And news flash there's 100 people a game you aren't going to have a 50% winrate. Even the top players don't have 25% winrates. Accept death and grow up with this stupid 'everyone is a cheater' mentality.Actual Review Pros Military Sim Massive Maps Endless Replayabiity due to varied circles loot and encounters Solid mechanical gunplay Good game for friends of 2 4 Custom game options Future Full Mod Support and Steam Workshop Stable game experience solid 60+ FPS with High/Ultra settings on even GTX 970 Organic game tension and funny moments High Skill/Medium Luck Easy to pick up Supports Controllers No Planned Paid Maps/Weapons/P2W mechanics only Cosmetic Boxes (which you can earn for free) Large Number of Weapons Vehicles and Items More Maps Vehicles and Weapons planned Constant game balancing Replay/Demo SystemCons Toxic Community (Unavoidable in this day and age but the complainers about supposed cheater plagues are the worse) Microtransactions (Cosmetic only if that bugs you) Only Two Maps currently with 3 Game Modes each having 2 variations (1st/3rd Person) Occasional Server Stability Issues (They do happen but are not unplayable start of game may be laggy until 20ish players die off) Running Sim (You'll spend a lot of time on foot if you don't enjoy that aspect in a game) Cheaters (They're not non existant but they're supremely rare personally never seen one once while playing or watching others play) Toxicity (Seriously Overwatch/LoL/Dota look tame by comparison. Stick to known friends),Recommended

ATTENTION! UNBIASED REVIEW INCOMING!!!! alright so you wanna buy the game but you are not sure because of some of the negative comments on here. thats fair you should be careful when buying games as a lot of them seem really cool but end up being 3D trashcans.I do not have a ton of playtime on this game however I would watch my friend play for some time and I have watched tons of videos on this game. tons. PROS AND CONS LIST TIME. D PROS great visuals for an early access title it looks fantastic. the map is really large for what this game is and offers a lot in terms of places to go lots of different types of weapons attachments gear clothing etc. controls feel great almost identical to any other FPS on the PC very high replay value to this game once you finish in the top 10 you wanna keep playing until you win. for 30$ its current price at the time of this review I consider a good fair price.CONS few visual bugs here and there mostly affecting terrain and buildings nothing game breaking. lack of character cusomization kind of dents the fun in that department. yeah you can unlock a random box to give you gear HOWEVER it gives you ONE piece of clothing and the price for one box is unusually high and it increases in price by double everytime you buy one. it really discourages you from caring about wanting to customize your player. And thats... about it. its really a fun game and in my opinion it feels more like a finished title rather than early access. dont pay much attention to the negative reviews when it comes to this game they more than likely cant break the top 60. ) I have not had any problems with people camping once or any other problems that others describe. 8/10 great game for the price of 30$. you will have a lot of fun I can promise you that.,Recommended

The game is pretty cool but i'ts ing annoying that i'm not able to decide what map to play on i hate the new map and love to play the old one but i always get placed in matches with the old one its like a ing 10/1 ratio you get the new map 10 times and the old one once or less I always have to leave and start matchmaking again because i really don't like miramar. There should be a feature where you can select if you wan't to play on the old map or on miramar. But it's still fun for me if I get the old map so I would recommend this game.Sorry for grammar errors English is not my native language.,Recommended

The best take on the battle royal format. It has the smoothest engine and controls compared to the other two. On the downside it's not very optomized. Most players have to play with everything on low to get a decent framerate. I have a GTX 1070 and I can only play medium with about 50 FPS. Another glaring issue is the FoV with is defaulted to 40. You can't see anything in firstperson pretty much and there's no way to change this without using third party scripts. Thankfully the developers announced and FoV slider and optimization patches that are to come out soon. Overall the game is worth the $30 price tag and it's my favorite game of this year.,Recommended
This is one of those games that boils down to a share your adventures with your friends simulator. You know the kind of water cooler talk people used to do with things like Skyrim because experiences can vary so wildly. Unfortunately there s a lot less to talk about when it comes to PUBG. That doesn t make it bad but it does seem like a one trick pony after a while.A large portion of my gaming community has already been playing this for a couple months and it never seemed quite like my style of game. I got the gist and even watched a few Let s Plays of it. It s essentially Hunger Games (Or Battle Royale if you re everyone else who has seen that movie which I have not). You can queue solo duo or with a squad up to four. With a hundred other people you re put on a plane that flies over a pseudo Slavic landmass (with town names like Po i and Lipovka ) and must choose where you drop in. The map is massive and littered with explorable buildings each with completely randomized loot. You can either get lucky and start off with scoped sniper rifles or unlucky and have to move through an open field with nothing but pistols and motorcycle helmets.Every couple of minutes there s a specific zone that every player must reach or a blue tech wall comes down and drains your health. It s a more boring version of the forest fire or poison gas from the Hunger Games movies just being a mechanic to get people moving and running into each other. Without it these games would be days long with people hiding in bathrooms.There s a sort of meta with a large portion of players choosing to hit up the military base and there s a more than average presence in the school due to there being a ton of rooms to explore and thus a good chance at decent loot to carry onward. After that stage of the game the Early Access rears its head. The experiences can vary wildly but there s not a whole hell of a lot to the game itself. There s not much left for me to talk about besides a few of the encounters I ve had. Water cooler talk engaged!It s not a game I typically play alone and three squad games in I managed to make it to 20 people left alive before dieing. During this game one of our idiot mates beached a boat on a tiny spot of land beneath the military base (Where the zone was closing in). We had to swim for several minutes while the number of players went down at a consistent rate. We killed a few people on the beach before I finally got sniped and a teammate carried us and pulled out a bonafide victory netting me four hundred ingame coins which only serve to give you clothing that you can start with. I m still holding out for that trenchcoat. In one idiot move that guy might have actually saved us from several gunfights that might have killed us otherwise because we spent half the game under water.During another squad game I didn t have much to my name except for a shotgun. We were under attack from another team downing one of my mates and circling my house. One of them opened the door and I unloaded downing and then killing them instantly. While I reloaded in a panic the other turned the corner and I did the same thing to them netting a double kill.In another I had the SKS sniper rifle which is a decent piece of equipment according to multiple sources. Unfortunately we had landed in the same area as another team. While my mates were taking cover I managed to down two and kill another in what was basically shotgun range netting me a triple kill.In a duo queue I was exploring a building without much luck before reaching the roof and got an instant shotgun to the face being one of the first ten to die. I knew someone else was around but didn t realize that they landed on the damn roof directly and just got lucky with a weapon. I was too busy laughing to be angry.After a while I decided to brave the solo queue and fared far better than expected making it to #18 and earning an above average payout for how long I lasted.That s part of the game really. Luck. The variance in experience seems to be what keeps people going despite the simple mechanics. It s certainly one of those games where I thought Why hasn t this been made already? Maybe it had but never quite captured the magic of PUBG. It s really not my style of game (I m not fond of pure PvP unless there s AI enemies involved) but once I figured out that this game could basically be compared to a roguelike it got better. It s a multiplayer roguelike the idea is not to win every time... But to see how far you can get.,Recommended
Battlegrounds is a really fun battle royale game to play with friends or solo. With weekly updates to fix bugs and work on optimization and also monthly updates to add new content this game is getting better every week. I would recommend if you like the H1Z1 battle royale or like shooter games in general. If you are cautious on the current state of the game I would wait to buy it until later on when the game is more polished but overall I like the game a lot.,Recommended

I hate how dynamic it is. I hate how the devs are listening to community feedback. Why can't developers just make games that I HAVE to play for hours on end that are not unique exciting and addicting? Goddammit. I hate to love this game.",Recommended
From some1 who has played this game from early access to launch it has come a long way. Were there bugs? yes. Did the devs address them all? No but they have been fixing them ata steady rate. A lot of negative reviews are about peoples personal gameplay experience or typical early access issues. The dev team pushed out regular patches all through early access even managed to get us a new map in time for launch. Big up to the devs and its a great game. Honestly just open youtube or twitch and guage by the number of players posting or streaming it.,Recommended

I Think I'm Paranoid I ve only just started my journey with PubG at 20 hours. This is a game filled with contradictions Fast and slow paced stealthy and loud overproduced and underproduced they come together in a chaotic fish bowl grinding into each other to create something experimental and powerful like a gymnast not a bodybuilder. It s intimidating to say the least every match starting and ending in embaressment at least until it doesn t and you Winner Winner Chicken Dinner . I haven t gotten there yet. My PubG experience has been one of narrow visioned paranoia from what I can only guess is feuled by the amphetamine drip of someone waiting around the next corner for you. You have to move quickly with certainty and force to break through to your next ramshackled house filled with loot or the already looted. It s a game that deserves to be played or attempted. With a game a popular as this is there tends to come some elitism I ve experienced it and there is no doubt that it doesn t deserve the reaction of This isn t a good game. but keep playing because f_ck that elitism b_llshit. It s worth your time but there are no easy roads for you f_ckers. Happy Hunting.,Recommended

"It actually is pretty fun. According to the devs and their roadmap it should only continue to improve in quality for years to come. Brenden Greene says he sees the game as a platform and will continue to treat it as such by supporting it for ""10 to 20 years "" trying to reach a status similar to Valve maintaining CS for such a long time.I can recommend that!",Recommended

Pros It's essentially Arma 3 Battle Royale without the clunkiness of the engine. Thus game feel a lot more fluid. Some may say it's very much like H1Z1 I think that this one is superior. Even though it is in Early Access the game feels very polished. Weapons and overall gunplay feel great. Few current concerns (That I'm sure will be addressed in future updates) At the moment the game needs some optimization which I am sure we will see in the future. Small fps dips here and there but nothing that essentially breaks the game. Servers do lag at times. Again this will be fixed in time. Overall for me it is a buy. If one had a choice between this and the other Battleroyale games this would be one to look into over others.,Recommended
ing amazing. Get it if now if you don't mind the slight optimization issues that will be gone soon enough. FR. 9/10 and not even finished yet. Must have. Before you get it look up what people with simalar specs have to say. It runs well on my ing 2014 (realesed in 2013) notebook with a 700 series gpu! Iz su G man.,Recommended
Honestly it can be rather buggy sometimes plus fps drops are more frequent than I wish. However it is still one of the best games I've ever played. The complete randomness of what can happen each game really helps keep the game fresh as no two games are the same for me. The developers are also constantly adding new content and trying to fix whatever issues they find as well. All in all needs a bit more work but definitely worth playing.,Recommended

This game is stupid but fun but only when I'm in a duo or squad with my friends on voice chat. The pacing is really weird for a game but a lot more like real life combat long periods of nothing or unrelated activity but no clear information on when you should do anything and then suddenly from out of the blue a quick engagement and death (yours or the enemy). Lots of cases where it's better to be stealthy vs. engage enemies too.,Recommended

"A lot of sad people complaining about a change that does not affect anything gameplay related. The game is enjoyable and plays better than ever. I have played since preseason 1 and the game it only getting better. The only argument against the game is optimization which could be better but it is still good. I run a 1060 3 gb and a i7 7000 and get between 100 144+ fps on competetiv settings. As of 30 06 2018I have maybe encountered obvious 2 cheaters in more then 800+ hours (with test) I only play FPP on EU. There is way less cheater in the game that some sheep here are telling in their ""review""Ingame cosmetic items does not ruin a game if they do not give you any advantage. A lot of the complaints around cosmetic items comes down to the lack of understanding about how to run a company. A valid criticism is that they should not release more skins into the game when there are obvious problems with the game. It gives a lot of players a bad taste as they feel PUBG are focusing on the wrong things. Especially when they release one patch to add skins and then later another patch to fix bugs etc. Do not be discouraged by all the people complaining. The game has given me hundreds of hours of entertainment but also some hours of disappointment but I feel the game is worth the cash $. BUT I strongly recommend playing the game with friends solo can be really hard for a new players and solo is generally the most frustrating game mode. Edit Reading some negative review of the game I can tell you that a LOT of them are false. There are people with 500+ hours talking about them not being able to find a red dot.",Recommended

PUBG is best enjoyed with 3 friends in squad mode it's a great time if you have squadmates who will communicate with each other and work together. Solo on the other hand is not quite as much fun and is where the game falls short the most. Haven't experienced too many glitches only a few of which could ruin a match. Overall it's an intense game that is a blast with a group of friends. Worth a buy if you like squad based shooters.,Recommended

"100 day review Playeruknown BattlegroundsDay 1 I embark into Erangel. The map is infested with them it may take weeks to clear them out.Day 2 I'm an unknown threat to them a predator in the shadows.Day 7 30% of the infestation has been wiped the bulk of them being simple minded and practically unable to walk let alone aim.Day 10 They have begun repopulating. their numbers grow just as fast as I can kill them. I must enlist help on this crusade to rid this infestation. Day 11 I have enlisted the help of a small group of hired guns to assist in purging them off this island.Day 14 The numbers begins to tip in my favour. However thgoogle translateey have begun mimicing me and my group. I lay awake at night restless they are learning. Day 18 They have managed to surround a few of my men today. They surrounded them and began chantting as they all ran at them at once. The survivers were found huddled around each other. They had all gone insane as if they had seen a monster. they kept whispering ""China number one"". Day 22 I only have a few men left. Most were swarmed others deserted. The population of the filth is all but unknown now I fear I won't be able to stop them.Day 31 A new threat has emerged from the depths of the hive. They're apex predators their aim is unparalleled their instincts heightened. Capable of seeing a target hundreds of meters away and through several walls. My men have started calling them ""Bing Bongs.""Day 35 The Bing Bongs are relentless they have slaughtered many of my men. I witnessed them slaughter their own kind without a second thought.Day 37 The number of Bing Bongs is skyrocketing I have had to call in some help. BattleEye Has launched a large strike on a few of the Bing Bongs central hive's but will it be enough to hold them back? only time will tell. Day 38 I have encountered a few Bing Bongs since the BattleEye strike however they are weakened. Their aim has being completetly impaired they just lean slightly and shoot at nothing. Perhaps they were somehow being augmented in the hives? Further reasearch must be done. Day 41 Another Bing Bong has been spotted today. I stood in awe as It ran faster than my men in a UAZ ( Ulyanovsky Avtomobilny Zavod ). He must have been running atleast 50m/s. my men they did not make it. Day 42 I encountered another enhanced Bing Bong. It moved so fast I was bearly able to keep track of It. It was unarmed but It would blink behind me then punch then run all the while It was taunting me laughing at me. As I land the killing blow It screams ""CHINA NUMBER ONE!"" I will not be able to sleep tonight. Day 44 I have been unable to sleep for three days due to the ominous threat of the Bing Bongs is to much. BattleEye Plans to attack the hives again tonight maybe I will be able to rest for a few hours. Day 45 No sign of the Enhanced Bing Bongs I remain vigilant.Day 46 I encountered a Bing Bong. The BattleEye strike must have worked It is unable to aim but It remains aware of my postition. A well placed nade kills It. Day 47 One of my men managed to record inside one of the hives. It appears they willingly accept a parasite that enhances their abillities beyond their biological limits. The BattleEye Strike only seems to kill the infected hosts and the surviving parasites morph and adapt to resist the BattleEye strikes. My hands haven't stopped shaking since I watched the recording. Day 54 The Infestation has spread they managed to get aboard a plane sent to resupply me and my men. Hives have begun sprouting up in Miramar the local goverment was fast acting and built a wall to enclose the area. All surviving civilians have been evacuated. Day 55 My men and I have left Erangel to deal with the threat in Miramar. The Bing Bongs here are different. Civilians saying that they witnessed a single Bing Bong kill as much as 30 people through walls buildings and hills. If this is true me and my men are walking into a slaughter. Day 58 The stories are true nowhere is safe. A plane with 92 men on it was flying into Miramar to provided aid for the Cleanse. The moment it was above the Hives all 92 men died they weren't even able to jump out of the plane. Thats when I saw it this filthy Bing Bong Feasting on a succulent chicken dinner amidst the mass grave of dead men. Day 59 BattleEye launches Its first strike on Miramar. Everyone is praying the strike works. Day 60 The strike worked but the Bing Bongs parasite is so volatile It has already adapted. Day 61 Following the recent strike many men have abandond the fight to cleanse Miramar and Erangle and moved to fortnite. I refuse to give up someone must remain to cleanse. Day 64 BattleEye has begun launching small strikes in rapid succession atempting to adapt as fast as the Bing Bong Parasite does. Day 68 The Rapid adaption is working small waves of Bing Bongs are being cleansed each time. This might be enough to ralley some men back to the Cleanse.Day 71 The number of Bing Bongs is decreasing however their lesser weakened forms still infest both Erangle and miramar. They seem to be operating as small guerilla groups hiding in the darkness ready to pounce on my men whilst they loot for supplies. We will have to be more cautious to avoid further casualties.Day 75 Me and my men have been tasked with cleansing Erangle as Miramars infestation population remains on the decline. Day 82 It appears that only 9% of the original infestation remains.The chanting of ""China Number One"" can be heard faintly at night.Day 95 Its been two weeks without a single Enhanced Bing Bong sighting. I have planned to take a large portion of the men I have to Sanhok the Bing Bong homeland. hopefully we will be able to wipe them out. Day 96 The island of Sanhok apears to be a training ground for the Bing Bongs we will be doing further research and reconnaissance onto what else they use the island for tomorrow.Day 97 Todays reconnaissance has provided alot of information as to what else this island is used for. They have large areas dedicated to growing farming and processing rice. This must be how they feed such a large population so effectively. Salt farms were also discovered along many of the islands coastlines. With a supply this large I can understand how they remain so volitile and aggressive all the time. Day 98 Great strides have been made in eradicating the indigenous population of Bing Bongs. I think my job is nearly done here. Day 99 Recently an Uknown corporation has been selling my men a pass. Its a list of diffrent things they want done on the island cleanse 100 Bing Bongs nade a few burn a couple et cetera et cetera. But after completing a few task they are rewarded with some Gucci clothes. Day 100 small pockets of the weakened Bing Bongs still inhabit Erangle and miramar. I continue to Purge and Cleanse as much as I can but due to the low numbers of weak Bing Bongs I find myself often waiting hours before encountering enough of them to retreat and resupply.After 100 Days of Cleansing I have accumulated enough chicken dinners to feed a large camp of vegans for a lifetime. 5/7 game would play 100 more days.",Recommended
Good ing game,Recommended
Always a fun time,Recommended
BEST GAME EVER!!! This game is so much fun and every match is packed with action even if you lose you still want to go in for another match the gunplay is smooth and works well driving is good but could improve definetly worth the money there are some bugs but it is early access and there are some bugs but what do you expect buying an early access game the gamemode is so much fun and creates suspense definetly recomend the game to any gamer out there either competitive or casual. Thank you for taking some of your time and reading my reveiw I really appreciate it.,Recommended
best multiplayer game of all time but needs optimization and mod updates,Recommended
Love this game play this game with friends if u are not to good in it!,Recommended
Hopefully post 1.0 updates optimize whole game P,Recommended
EARLY ACCESS. Key words to keep in mind when playing. Yes it's buggy glitchy and crashes but theres no better feeling than getting a chicken dinner after accidently killing one of your friends cause they walked into your grenade.,Recommended
PUBG is fun as hell. Unlike my old favorite FPS CS GO PUBG is easy to jump into right away and with far more fun and far less stress (no teenagers screaming about their rank!).The game is tense like nothing I've played before. You can spend a half hour gathering weapons and supplies only to turn a corner and be blased in the face with a shotgun and its all over. One of the scariest moments has to be when you're alone in a house and hear a car pulling up outside. Few games make my heart race like this one.PUBG is poorly optimized and buggy but I expect that to be fixed over time. It's a fantastic experience and a bargain at $30.,Recommended
Love this style of game and yes this game needs a lot of work especially in the optimization department but the devs are well aware of this and they are doing all they can to make this experience a great one for everyone except hackers/cheats.PRO'S Highly addictive Huge map Loads of hiding places Great vehicles Solo's Duo or Quad squad matchups Excellent visuals and audio Frequent updates and patches CONS lagg is insane Framerate drops are like insane Hackers/Cheats ruining people. Not fully optimized Controller not supported (can still be used but not supported)Overall I strongly recommend this game to anyone. If you get ruined by a cheater/hacker then its easy to jump straight in to another round. As development continues the game will become way more stable and playable but if you can pick this up now then you will have plenty of time to get practice in before it leaves Beta stages.,Recommended
PUBG it aight,Recommended
i thank very nice!,Recommended
"I have and will spend many more hours on this game but it has to be the most overrated piece of garbage that is un optimised to half the player base are chinese that scream into your headset at the start of a game but make it that extra bit funnier each time you play. Most of the time you will die by someone camping in a bush stairwell behind a tree house or just being prone in the grass but most people would argue this is playing the game ""strategically"". I would say that it is a lazy and unforgivible playstyle for those who use it making me hate this game even more because 9/10 times you encounter people is through walking into them camping or them shooting you in the back. I dont recomend this game to people who dont want to waste their time a luck based loot and non skillful gameplay as it does not award a player with using thier aim to their advantage but rewards campers to use a silecened gun the has no penalties to the shooter or his gun and shoot people from 5 meters away without being heard.Yes I do like this game but it frustrates me alot with how many people that take advantage of the third person camera to peek around walls and with them being totally unseen also the people that camp in all spots which for me ruins the game as a whole. hopefully with the new desert map update they make a much more open and easily viewable environment so it makes camping alot more difficult and brings skill based shooting from long distances into play.I do though recommend this game to people playing in groups as that is the most fun I have had in my whole entire play time throughout this game. )",Recommended

Pretty good game fun to play in groups.,Recommended
Buggy as . However this game reigns supreme for me in terms of strategy awareness and patience. If you're looking for a COD style shooter or a Halo beat me up look elsewhere. If you're looking for a game that rewards planning positioning and knowing the best times to fire hold fire advance withdraw and making the best possible use of terrain then this is the game for you. As it is in early access it tends to crash to desktop and cause massive sound bugs but it remains a joy to play despite that.,Recommended

Finally a BR game I can enjoy. One that actually has great shooting mechanics. Good sound effects weapon attachments. No stupid ing cash grab key crates.. yet. Big map great graphics pick when to drop out of the plane during the match start. Performance is hit n miss for people. I get solid 50 80fps with a 1080 TI and 4690k 4.5ghz + ssd. I see people complain about joining games. In the few hours I played I never had any connection issues. If you are worried about some of the bugs issues just hold off buying it. If you have a good rig and stable internet grab it.,Recommended
Didn't have high hopes buying this game but after playing around on it for some time I started to enjoy it. Gives you an adrenaline rush when you get into those 1 on 1 situations everytime.I recommend this game to those of you that love competitive and fast pased gameplay.,Recommended

China,Recommended
I like this game. There is a layer of skill to this game beyond just find somebody and shoot them. It's timing and luck and planning out your moves in advance while maintaining 360 awareness. That being said there is terrible netcode issues at times. Usually when the North America server is overrun with Cheating Chinese players and their ping abuse/wall hack/aimbot/recoil hack/ etcetera goes unrestricted. Basically avoid NA server middle of the day in NA and you're generally alright. There is also the small issue of their loot distribution algorithm sometimes being a little...off... example... drop from plane.. loot 5 buildings find multiple back packs gun attachments random ammo rare level 3 armor/helmet.. no ing weapons gets killed by a naked guy with a shot gun. / or vice versa... find 15 really awesome weapons no backpack to carry ammo and no attachments. / still a good game overall. Just needs more updating.,Recommended

really enjoyable game to play it really gets ur blood pumping when ur running through a filed and suddenly the dirt flies up with a gunshot and you have to try take that person out. the games are moderately long depending on how good u are. peopel are claiming that they have gotton band by streamers but would seem very unlikely. however somethimes the game does take a while to load in but other than that its a really fun game worth the 30,Recommended
The best game. Is a bit hard to get use to at first i wanted to refund the game but after 10 min i cancel the request. And I never regret my choice.,Recommended
The game is so much fun the feeling of survival with your group is amazinghere are some suggestions to improve 1 surround sound should be improved in the game as when we are being shot at from a distance we cant figure out the location of the enemy.2 melee attack should be added to bring windows and use (point 3 below).3 the jump should be improved the character cannot vault at windows or over small fences. 4 should allow 5 players in a team.5 More variety of houses could be added as you can enter the same house you entered 1 mile back.,Recommended
This is a complete uppgrade to h1z1. Why did i didint enjoy h1z1? cuz of many facts..U can't find scopes/upgrades in h1z1..The cars in h1z1 is and glitches all the time..Random spawnes..low fps on some of the random parts of the map. (even tho i have gtx 1080 and i7 proccesor).Cannot see where the granades will be thrown..Wierd level/ranking system..Bad community.weapons unbalanced.PUBG is the oppisite of h1z1 and has many good features and a good community. I think definitely everyone shall atleast try this game before they alk this game.,Recommended
Very good game. Constantly evolving with new updates and patches. It's the number one played game on steam and it's still in early access so that tells you pretty much enough. Took me about 70 hours to get my first couple of wins and I'm ready to sink in many more hours on top of that.,Recommended
Would definitely recommend this game! A nice mix between luck &amp skill leads to just an overall fun experience.I've played solo duo and squad all of them are unique on strategy. LOVE IT,Recommended

Incredibly tense firefights and oh moments. I've also learned a lot of insightful things about international race relations.

(July 27 2017) Great game but severe optimization issues that simply aren't acceptible even in early access. I expect the engine to at least be alpha before early access starts... Killing Floor 2 did this and it should be the standard. I'm running a 1080 ti and i7 6700k with a custom loop which included dual 240mm radiators and I see temperatures approaching 100C on Ultra. ALL OTHER GAMES PERFORM AT TEMPERATURES UNDER 50C. This is a huge problem. The game runs just above 50C at medium settings which is still ridiculous. Because the game looks like something out of 2008. I also have difficulty understanding why a frame cap of 60fps is not the default Or why there is not an option to cap framerate at your monitor refresh rate. I should not have to go into the settings file to manually set this myself. All this said this game is very enjoyable. I'd be happy with 10 maps at release and perhaps double the current number of weapons and vehicles. Accuracy on full auto is a bit ridiculous this should be patched and made more realistic. I will update this review once I am satisfied that the developers have optimized the game sufficiently.Update (Nov 27 2017) Update Optimization has improved. I can now run PUBG on Ultra and maintain 60C in my water loop but the level of detail with respect for the demand on my system is still disproportional. That said the concept of this game at the time of early access release was unique. And it is wicked fun. I've bought several copies of this game for friends and we frequently find outself gaming for 4 5 hrs straight on days off/weekends. Highly recommend PUBG assuming it keeps its $30 price tag. Any higher and it would need more content although the second map is on the way.Would like to see a night mode would be a lot of fun. And looking forward to the vaulting system. Teammates killed in a vehicle should not fall out. And passengers in vehicles should be able to heal while driving.Update 2 (Dec 20 2017) New map is very well done. Graphics look good. Hardware wise my system is running much cooler albeit in Canadian winter so ambient is lower. Pretty happy with the release. Vaulting is included. Good but not great. I'd like to be able to cat grab walls over my head and pull myself up. but it's a step in the right direction. You're now able to heal in a vehicles as a passenger so it would seem that the developers are listening. With that in mind I feel I can now recommend this game and will continue to support it so long as continual content is released. 2 maps is a start and appreciating how large they are 10 is a bit much to ask but I would like maybe 2 or 3 more before we start seeing DLCs assuming we come to that.,Recommended
This has to be one of the best games I have ever played. The battle royale mechanic is phenomenal along with the graphics and the online multiplayer system. A perfect gift for your friends. I rate this game 9/10.,Recommended

"I love this game and really enjoy playing it. I recently got banned for no reason I never hacked use macros software programs or anything to altar my performance in game. After 2 days of desperately trying to contact the devs about their mistake the ban was appealed and i could play my beloved game again. Be very careful when playing the game because if you get too ""good"" people report you because they are salty that you out played them and if you ""outplay"" many people in 1 game all those reports get you banned and thats the problem the banning process is automated so there is no ""logical"" decision making when it comes to being banned or not.",Recommended

"This game is great don't listen to any of the idiots who don't know how to read.

It's not a cash grab. This game is amazing. They're selling this for a good reason. Does no one know how to read anymore? Stop downvoting the game because they want to fund their event. Read people.

When I bought the game on its release date. I actually refunded after playing for an hour or less. I didnt want to get into another alpha incase the creators abanoneded it. Fortunately this game isnt that the devs actually work on it allot. Hell its even #1 on steam right now and has high hopes. This game is competive and great with friends but can be played alone. You make more money if you win a solo game anyways its also allot easier to win a solo game. Personally with the way things are going Id 100% recommend this game to anyone who like 1st or 3rd shooters.,Recommended
This Game is amazing i dont know why people are asking for reigon locks in the games ive been in i havnt met many hackers and have had fun playing againest other chinese players.,Recommended
Better than fortnite XD,Recommended
Buggy but funny...,Recommended
So good and interesting game!!! 10/10,Recommended
Amazing game. Consistant content and quality of life updates great hit registration the devs listen to the community you can get crates in game without having to spend any money!,Recommended
This is a awesome game that is all i can say. #winner_winner_chicken_dinner.,Recommended
great game just turn down your volume.,Recommended
What a gamee !!! I LOVEEE IT,Recommended
Unlike H1Z1 this game isn't trash. I personally haven't run into any lag like some of the others on here but I feel for those who have. Luckily PLAYERUNKNOWN posted saying that their first two updates and the majority of updates over the next several months will be focused on optimization. All in all the game is early access so some issues are to be expected. It's not without its faults. That said I personally believe it to be the best battle royale game on the market currently.,Recommended
so immersive and amazing,Recommended
Whilst it may be from the same creator and is basically the same game it is a lot better than H1Z1's battle royale (that doesn't really say much though)More balanced in terms of map size and has more of the Arma 3 vibe to it. There are plenty of weapons and the hitboxes work well. Generally the feel is better and comes across as a little more polished.That being said there are gameplay issues. The game can be laggy and experiences a lot of FPS drops. It can be a little bit clunky too. This is not Battlefield when it comes to smoothness of operation. The game doesn't look great although this is largely down it being almost unplayable at higer settings.This is my last early access game. I really really hope they don't pull an H1Z1 because it would be a shame.,Recommended
Product received for free. amazing game. entertaing competetive you name it! 100% recommended (strong pc is needed). Only one count the fog is in its current state. you cant see in the woods and laying down with ghuilli suit in the fog makes u invisible. other tham that amazing job hope it continues. and please remove that black box that pops up while Aming with your reddot!,Recommended
Having a lot of gun in BattleGrounds. I've played the Arma 3 mod H1Z1 King of the hill and other mods here and there but this one is the best out of them all and thats a understatment to be fair. the only issues at the moment are performance. (already adressed for a april 14th update),Recommended
The best '' battle royale '' game ever ),Recommended
The new update is a step in the right direction.,Recommended
Fun game. There is no game without bugs/cheats but overall is worth it.,Recommended
Better than h1z1. must buy it,Recommended
just play it no need explanation,Recommended
Addicted!!,Recommended
Great game too play with friends It will keep getting better since it's early access although can be pretty gay if you have no friends.,Recommended
This game still has a few bugs but its really fun to play!!,Recommended
If you enjoy playing this game thats probably a sign that you have severe autism.,Recommended
put this game on free weekend or something else cause there is many ppl who dont want buy it before try it for 2 4 hours.,Recommended
This is a great game I would recommend this to any of my friends. It has a fair combat system loot is never a problem to find and sniper battles in the forest are super cool. The combat zoning makes for quicker matches and makes a deterant for campers and forces us to meet up and fight at one point. I can't wait to see what this game has to offer in the futureAnyone who likes ARMA or dayZ would enjoy this game alot. You don't have to worry about going hungry or thirsty like dayZ letting you focus on combat more then just survival.,Recommended

So....I went traveling with my friend once he is a baker I am a zoologist. We were skydiving to this cool tourist island but ladned at the old communist base.We jumped off next to the western bridge found an AK and a pistol. I had a lot of gun experience so I took the rifle.After fliping our newly discovered car we climbed on top of the bridge which lead us to not finding a single person in the vicinity.We carried on through the field where we saw a crate falling from the sky. Inside there was a m249 which I gave to my friend. We moved on just to find a motorbike (which we fell off of like 5 times breaking my friend's toe.) Later we camped in the forest trying to find some food or shelter but we had to leave due to the large blue forcefield pushing us forward. After getting shot couple of times we found ourselves crawling across the forest with low ammo no meds no proper guns and a lot of pain. That was the moment my friend got shot and started to bleed. I killed the assailants which got us a ticket of the island.Oh yeah I heard the game is good I have yet to try it.,Recommended
Cool game,Recommended
Product received for free. This is my overview of the game. This game has a unique experience and offers a different set of events each time playing. I will be going over each of the pros and cons of this game along with my final decision. Is this game worth it?PROS Open worldDifferent Unique ExperiencesA variety of vehicles and weaponsTactical CombatVery fun with friendsCONS PriceUnstable fpsRequires a beefy computerToxic CommunitySo is this game worth it? My answer would be yes you should buy this game the high price of this game is sure to go up even more after the full release. The combat and tactical fun open world gameplay allows for a great experience. That is as long as your computer can run it.TIPS FOR IMPROVING FPS Anti Aliasing Medium (This is massive it puts less stress on the cpu)Post Processing Low ( balances the gpu and cpu stress)Textures High ( Allows for greater visibility and makes the game not look like trash)Everything Else Very Low ( you will be able to spot enemies quicker in grass etc.)Look up how to override dpi!Look up how to set process priority!Look up launch options for this game!,Recommended

Just installed this game few days ago and it was pretty good.,Recommended
You just gotta know you die over and over again. You get better over time and then you kick ss. Don't worry everyone died eventually not everyone is a pro remember millions of people have been in the same boat plane you are in. Enough pep talk go kill some commies for me.,Recommended
Loving the game so far!! The optimization needs to catch up but I can excuse it because it hasn't been out that long. Keep up the good work.,Recommended
One of the greatest ideas ever. The hype is real and you'll pretty much be hooked to this once you get the hang of it. It's true that this game is far from completion and you'll face a lot of bugs. Sometimes I wanted to smash my PC with a baseball bat because of frustration but still this is a brilliant idea that is getting better with the devs fixing all the issues. I would completely recommend people to buy this game.,Recommended
Wadu Hek,Recommended
Best game I've played in a long time. Seriously. Yes there are some bugs but it's still early access and doesn't break the game. Performance is low but that is expected with great graphics running on Unreal Engine 4. The gameplay is a lot of fun and each game is different. The way the play area shrinks during the game keeps each match interesting and forces campers out into the open. 10/10 would jump into the military base again.,Recommended
Gucci funny game but I think it's little bit overrated and hyped.. It's so f*ckin' rng but basically it's what is that game about D (l mean loot zone..) and.. Just don't talk about optimization.,Recommended
A lot to improve,Recommended
i love this game i really do but you bluehole and fix the bugs.,Recommended
laggy desync mess.Edit actually i made this review when i died in 2nd place with 14 kills due to some t. But in all honesty this game has so much potential you have to giove credit where credit is due. They are doing well with their scheduled patches and matinence. One thing they need to fix is server performance so that you dont stutter and die to t. But all in all its a great game. Defintely better then H1Dead1.,Recommended
Really fun game!,Recommended
I know this will go unseen amougnst the hundreds of thousands of reviews from this game but I felt the need to write a positive review because I believe some people are too hard on this company. First of all no one disagrees that this game and concept are really ing awesome. You WILL have the most insane adrenaline rush of your life in some games with a ton of different strategies and approaches to keep it interesting as well as action packed. There's everything at risk when you're in the top 10 and it makes the chicken din din that much more tasty. The only bad thing about it is the servers are laggy sometimes because there's so many damn people playing I have faith they will fix it as they've done before multiple times.This company (Bluehole) is always trying to improve the game and make it more polished I can tell they are passionate about creating a great gaming experience based on the founders and history.IMHO one of the best videogames ever conceived. 9.995/10,Recommended
just optimize it,Recommended
i die everyday,Recommended
Really good game even when u are running all game ands get killed in last second of healing D,Recommended
Got this game because I saw half of my friends list playing it and figured it must be worth jumping into. This is only the 2nd EA game that I have purchased so I'm not to fond of spending money on unfinished products. I've had it for 2 months now and the updates come each month with huge changes that actually make the game feel like it's moving smoothly towards be completed at some point.The game itself does have it's fair share of bugs but it feels like the developer knows of the major bugs and tries to squash those as quick as possible and then work out the minor ones along the way. They release major updates every month and minor weekly updates that usually address new bugs and minor improvements to systems.Gameplay wise this game is great. I've only played Arma 3 King of the Hill and Wasteland modes so I don't have a ton of playtime invested in Battle Royal games. Every match is fun whether you win or are the first one to die. When you finally get into that last 10 your heart will start racing as you try to not up getting that chicken dinner.,Recommended

As of Update 14 VERY pleased with the state of the game and the server lag is comparable to CSGO. Well worth.,Recommended
good game !,Recommended
Chinese hackers t lagging and killing my friend via running him over. Quality.,Recommended
Honost Review Game Mechanics Overall this game feels nice to play but there is some lag components if you have a much worse computer than others. Smoothness The Game can be choppy at times for example on my computer when I throw a flashbang and it lands in the building and I look away my game lags to hell. Other than that is is fun and it is easy to get kills.Player Base Overall if you do not play computer games with your freinds this will not be fun after a while. Pubg is a much funner game with freinds. Even though there is a duo mode most of the people in duos dont have mics and or they are Asian and dont speak english. So have freinds to play pubg with. One other thing I do want to point out HACKERS This game is infested with them like the black plague. Almost every single PUBG match I have played there has been a hacker wheather they are doing the weird car hack aimbot speed hacks someone always has to ruin the game. But the bright side is that Blue Hole has been doing their best to get rid of these hackers in enormous ammounts a day!!! Thank You Soo Much Blue Hole!Overall Buy this game when and if it goes on sale some people say its too expensive for what its worth and I agree. If the price was lowered down to lets say $19.99 $15.99 it would make sales quick but $29.99 is a bit expensive I think Blue Hole. Runs choppy at times but beefy computers have no problems and the graphics are phonomonal! If you made it this far THANK YOU for reading this and I hope you found this helpful!,Recommended
Hands down best BR game out there! The devs are woking hard and constantly updating the game so the pubg experience keeps getting better and better. PS Not an easy game at all the shooting in this is very realistic thus hard to master.,Recommended
I do not post many reviews. I will be quick.ProsGood size map.Nice Weapons to choose from.Team Play is nice.love the gameplayConsSeems to me but I die alot even when I have the drop on players. (me shooting first)LOTS of either AIM bots and/or cheaters in the game. 1 out of 3 deaths are questionable.Exsample The first house you go in from the plane drop. Then like 7 10 mins goes by after you loot all the items in the house and are in the 2nd circle now...Must be some type of location hack. When your in the 2 story of a house in a bath room with the door closed in the tub area and a player runs straight in the house straight upstairs to the bathroom and you shoot first as he comes in and you still die... I think that is a questionable death.,Recommended
Alot of people complain about hackers and but i have never run into one and i have had this game since early 2017. It is what fortnite wants to be. The one problem it has is optimization and even then its not as bad as crysis 3 or rust. Devs do not listen to the players or popular streamers and they treat the game like it is still in early access. The only reason fortnite has more players is because you dont need a good pc to run it and its free. Very cpu intensive so i recommend i5 or up.,Recommended
I love this game10/10 would smash......my f***ing face into my monitor! I mean unless you like being in the moment you got your scar all decked out with a load of ammo level 3 vest and helmet and then (This is were gets juicy) you find the one vehicle in the whole god dam map and it happens to be a f***king bike so your like s**t gotta take this before i get f**ked by the zone so you take that bike and you floor it up the road then you decide to try and turn a little early and it bites you in the (cause you didnt know that a little rock was just sitten there waiting for its prey) so you take that turn just a little to early and go on the grass for 1 whole second and get F**KED and die...... Losing all sanity you go onto the gamepage and right a review about how S**T THE GAME IS!!! (But then go and play another round because you like it when you get a kill by falcon punching someone who has a shotgun),Recommended

I have played this game for a while now. Not really sure what the draw is to this game by so many. I could play this game for 1000hrs and still have the same as the new guy? (crates dont count) I do enjoy the game and after playing fortnight for free I can confirm **THIS** game is worth money in comparison. I have seen a few hackers but there are really good players in here as well so dont cry when you die. The developers are doing a good job of continuing to bring more content to the game for free. Overall I would say yes I recommend this game to any of my friends. It had its share of trouble in BETA but its not in beta anymore and the full release is faily solid.,Recommended
In this game it's either get good RNG or die with 3 pairs of pants 5 smokes and a machete. Pretty fun with a team though player base is not as toxic as some may make it out to be and it really is quite enjoyable.,Recommended

I'm mixed with this game. I mean the little time I pass on it is fun but stability issue (my internet connexion is not Good as it should be) and graphical bug ( waiting 1 2 minutes after landing to the have the graphic loaded even in medium with a 970 4Go) made me ask a refund.It will be a Good game if the dev continue to improve it.Just a point some in the community is a little toxic beginning the game with People swearing on the other in the mic is not pleasant.Edit The 1.0 is out and now the game is quite good and stable so forget what I said and go! Jump on 1 of the 2 map grab a gun/rifle/shotgun and try to make some kills. Be the first to see and you'll be sure to kill first. It's a hunt you are both the hunter and the prey.Good luck.,Recommended

PUBG is a game where you drop into an island with 99 other people and you try to be the last one remaining. It is one of the largest Steam games played and while it has its upsides it also has some downsides.7/10Pros Has a ton of replayability. Fun gameplay with many guns to choose from. Easy to learn but hard to master.Cons Gets boring if you play alone. Cheaters. Gameplay can get repetitive. Expensive. Need a decent PC to run. Bugs are prevalent which prevents it from being esports ready.,Recommended
Game is fun but you get boned by everyone GL,Recommended
This game is definitely not esports ready but the same can be said of Hearthstone. So at the end of the day it's a game that's trying to move that way despite not even able to leave early access yet.Great game though should really just play it with friends in my opinion. Probably still better than similar games that are out there that have a battle royale format.,Recommended
i will definatly recommend this game because the gameplay never gets old and the only problem i experienced was a mild case of aimboters. but even that is rare.,Recommended

I was never a fan of this type of survival game. I have to admit PlayerUknown has done an amazing job. I have been consistently playing this the last few weeks and cant get enough. Every round is a little bit different and tactics are always evolving to fit the round. Either playing solo Duo or a full squad of 4 I have found this to be a great addition to my steam library. With consistent updates the game is only getting better. I highly recommend this title. Thank you Bluehole.,Recommended

Excellent game but the amount of hackers is getting unbearable. All chinese flooding to oceania has ruined OC where out of 4 games you will encounter a hacker in atleast 3 of them. Needs urgent fix but other than that great game,Recommended
I like to find a sickle and pretend to harvest wheat within the open fields outside Pochiniki and Yasnaya Polyana. As I reap my crops I like to take in the serenity of the landscape around me and listen to the distant echos of gunfire and the low humming of the cargo planes as they pass overhead all instilling in me a sense of tranquility that no other game has done before. I wish the developers could make it so that the sickles can actually cut wheat rather than completely going through them. I believe this would help add some more realism into the game. That is my only complaint other than that the game is perfect.,Recommended
Great game overall would recommend to all,Recommended
I am crap at this game but this game is still fun.,Recommended

Get it.If you want to swat bullets out of the air with a frying pan like a ninja. Get it.This game has surpassed all of my expectations and it honestly very well put together. Get it.11/10 would become frying pan jedi again. Get it.,Recommended

I like it! Best Royale Battle Shooter I've seen. Not much bugs and if there are some they are most likely fixed. The only downside is that it isn't optimized that well yet but it's still in pre release so I can understand that.,Recommended
forttzaaa tataaaaa,Recommended
Probably good if you enjoy spending most of the gameplay grabbing loot,Recommended
Need a lot of Ram otherwise risk having the buildings not loading for the first five minutes of the game,Recommended
You gotta be in it for the long haul praying for that sweet optimization.Also familiarize yourself with the deathcam and the report button....and learn chinese...russian too.10/10,Recommended
7/10 my overall rating. can the dev fix the hacker that is ruin the game that will be great,Recommended
I brought this game when it was Early Access. Now it's not and the game is still so good and fun. If you got some friends to play with you should do it,Recommended
good game,Recommended
This is such a sound game. Some of the bugs just make it better.,Recommended
Well...apart from all the bugs an excellent game...Danger addictiveness,Recommended
Coming from H1Z1 to this....gotta say I enjoy this more than the previous game mentioned.Once I got this game and started to play I played it non stop for about 2 weeks.Given a little luck and skill you can go far and have many play styles....you can either hide and wait or be aggresive.If you don't have this game give it a try...even though it's still in early access I think it's worth it.Or you could keep playing H1Z1 or Fortnite..which is free lol.Try that too.,Recommended
Great Game,Recommended
If you want to play a good game get the game before v1.0 comes out.,Recommended

Region lock China and the other Asians cuntries out of Ocenania. They wreck the duo games and up as they can't speak english so teamwork is crap. They have an Asian server and St East Asian server. Go play with each other literally. Otherwise it's an average take on the original Day Z. Someone will get it right someday.,Recommended
Without a doubt the best battle grounds game on the market at the moment,Recommended
Great game but it is early access so except alot of bugs. The game is poorly optimized but still playable on my gtx 660. I got 50 to 60 frames on low. Definetely recommend getting it with friends and running squads.,Recommended

A lot of people complain about the game running like trash but if you have a descent GPU then you should be fine. I personally have a MSI GAMING X GTX 1070 8GB and Intel I7 5820k and 16gb ram. I run the game at 140 fps never drops below 60. Also havent experienced any bugs or huge issues.Know on to the gameplay its great its refreshing every game you join into and when you have those awesome battle against another squad it feels great. The guns all feel very good. If you enjoy battleroyale games you will definetly enjoy PUBG. I only have 7 hours but i will continue to play it and try to get a win.I certainly reccomend the game especially if you have friends. Lasyly please check if you can run the game dont just buy it and then think you will run it. A good website is GAMEDEBATE to check specs and see if yours are good enough.,Recommended
So PUBG is a battle royale game that throws you out of a plane on to an island along with 99 other players. You have some choice on where to land in the large play area and then you proceed to loot abandoned cities and the like. You can play solo in a duo or squad (four players) there's guns there's vehicles many shirts and a few hats. The game motivates/forces players to engage by shrinking the playable area as the game goes on untill remaining players are left in a tiny circle. The last player or team standing wins. Let me lay out some pros and consPROS Unique gameplay not many alternatives Every single kill makes you feel like you won the game Well made guns and gunplay feels good if a bit awkward Huge map (more maps to come I hear) Promotes socialization and provides a large variety of teamplay tactics if playing in a group or duo Looting is fun and stays fun at least for a while Sometimes the visuals shine.CONS Many strong tactics can be.. frustrating and cancerous like room camping hiding in bushes for 20 minutes etc. Game feels rough and often awkward janky. Some features to come will address this other parts may stay as they are Demanding on your system. As of now can have inconsistent performance even on good systems. Some inconsistent approaches to realism like you can jump off the 3rd floor of a building to take minimal damage but killing yourself in a vehicle accident is pretty easy sometimes by just jumping out of a (not too fast) moving ride If you queue with random people they might just shoot you or throw the game otherwise so you really want some friends over voice chat to get the cooperative experience.PRO or CON you decide In my experience most engagements are decided by luck if you happen to see your enemy first you have a huge advantage. Same with where the game area shrinks to if you happen to be in it you can just find a strong position and hold. To sum up you can wander the map for 20 minutes not coming across anybody and then get 1shot in the head from an unknown place PUBG has its issues but if it's your type of game it'll grab you and won't let go. There are many things in store for the future as it's early access and the devs say they want to develop it as an online game (meaning with post release free updates). Oh and it might be your type of game without you even knowing I initially very much disliked the idea of it but then gave into friend advice and I'm loving it.Grab some friends and give it a try.,Recommended
I like this game because is fun to play with friends and it is also addictive very addictive! But it is bad optimized and i hope you are you going to fix these problem as soon as possible. Anyways after all you have made 7 World Records congratulations.,Recommended
It currently says mixed how ever i think Bluehole is doing a great job with this game. Having played countless other games and seeing how this game gets a decent to good flow of updates. The game itself is allot of fun that is if you are looking for the thrill of being on the edge of life and death. This game is how ever only for the more advanced shooter players who dare to take risks are aware of their surroundings and know when and when not to shoot a player (don't be trigger hungry!) At this point there is some controversy as ppl like to call it regarding player bans. The funny part about it is 9 out of 10 cases the player could have prevented it from happening. But instead (also top streamers) just say it's not there fault but the games fault. That is like saying... well a bank had there vault doors open so it's not my mistake of taking things out of it but the banks fault so don't arrest me! So i think that it is great that even the partners who promote this game are not immune to punishments I have seen games before where any player doing the smallest thing would get them banned and a streamer who got them customers would get away with it. Bluehole has some flaws here and there but who doesn't? I see Bluehole evolving yes they make mistakes but if they see they were wrong they will correct it. After having so many sales they have hired fresh blood. Which means those that are new will make some mistakes that the more experienced staff would not. Keep it up Bluehole and ignore the army of haters that like to be zombie nized by their favorite streamer who likes to cry after getting banned for being an idiot! ),Recommended

Well many loathe this game explicitly expressing their disdain of this game yet they still completely exhaust their offhours in it. Me myself for one instance is among them. There are bugs there are cheaters there are officials who are constantly saying sorry for their servers to be down again but as long as there are friends to enter squad matchmaking with this game will go on to keep me from playing other games.,Recommended

"This is one of the most fun multiplayer games to come out in the last few years!It's not for everybody and this game had a pretty rocky road through early access to get it to release. But now with 1.0 out they have delivered on all their promises and you have a fairly complete game with easily hundreds of hours of play without it getting old. Once you survive the early game every pubg game is different (made even more memorable through the replay system where you can watch back how it played out). Most games end up being more about the journey and not the destination as 95% of your games will end with you suddenly getting shot by a guy or squad that you didn't see in time. But for that 5% where you make it to the final few left... Man... There is nothing else like it in gaming right now. I've never played a game that could give me as consistently high an adrenaline rush in the late game like this one. Once you get confident enough to not only survive until the late game and be able to do more than just hide that's where the game really shines. The final moments where you (and your squad mates) are barely even breathing because its so intense right up until the point where you get the final kill is downright cathartic usually in a collective cheer and sigh of relief followed by ""one more game?""If you have gotten good with other shooters be aware that this game does have a pretty big learning curve with both combat game sense and even parachuting tactics towards the beginning of the game. There are not many opportunities to get comfortable with the combat enough to get a handle of each gun's recoil and bullet drop and so it takes a bit of time to get used to each weapon. Also it will be frustrating at first when it always seems like someone finds a gun before you do and ends up shooting you before you get to do anything. Once you get better at parachuting and quick thinking with regard to where to loot that type of game will happen less and less.It's a really intense game in solo but its made even better in duo and squad game modes particularly if you have friends to play with (the in game chat usually features lots of spam which leads most people to use programs like Discord for game chat). The duo and squad games I think have the most replayablility.The only major issues I've had with the game are early game lag and buggy vehicle controls particularly with the bikes which have a tendency to flip and glitch out on the terrain either damaging or killing its drivers most of the time. The red zones are also a bit of a pain in the as a game mechanic but I suppose keeps the game interesting with a little element of randomness. Also I have only ever encountered a few hackers (which are easy to spot through the death cam and replay functions) but then again I play on mostly first person servers and the hackers tend to prefer the third person ones. The UI can also be a little buggy particularly with the menus as it often doesn't always show friends online that should be online making it difficult to get people into the party. The loot boxes in the game are also pretty laughable which each box containing one really dull pair of clothing that you don't want anyways. I've opted to selling them on the steam market rather than opening them and have ended up making up all the money I paid for this game and then some which is really a plus.Overall there is a reason why this is one of the most played games out right now. Once you get past the learning curve its a fun thrilling and endlessly frustrating experience (in an oddly good way) that always makes you keep coming back for more. Battle Royale as a game genre may have existed in some form before this game but this is really the first game that really made it a thing. It's a new fresh experience after a relentless onslaught of rehashed fight die respawn fight die respawn first person shooters like the Battlefield and Call of Duty series which I've honestly gotten bored of. The gameplay in PUBG feels a lot more fleshed out where each game feels like its own small adventure until they inevitably end with you getting unceremoniously shot in the back of the head or finally getting that sweet Winner Winner Chicken Dinner.",Recommended

Amaazingly beautiful great game worth the money,Recommended
Seriously an incredible game. The shooting in this game in fantastic and easily stands out from other shooters. The development behind this game is amazing and listens to the community. I cannot recommend this game enough The rush given by this game while removing the grind that is normally entailed in games such as Dayz.,Recommended
Really fun game especially when playing with friends need some more work servers a little bit more gameplay and equipment options but it's still early and i believe many things will improve later on.Something i noticed recently is the aiming system has some fouls. It's realistic enough but if you want auto mode you have to shoot slower than single cause of the recoil. You need recoil not that much if we say the present recoil is at 9/10 you need something like 7/10 (for auto especially) i don't say make it like call but if you want to shoot more rapid you lose enough accuracy.,Recommended
this game is fun with friends and thats it! Chinese players have ruined majority of the game spamming and yelling the whole time and hacking.,Recommended
This game is amazing few things to fix and add after all still early acesss but its amazing like to spend time on that and its a really hard game but its fun and ive seen just one hacker and thats alright few hackers are there but most notI bet that all of the guys which gave bad review just beacuse they havnt won yet just try more amazing game and im waiting to have more maps!So worth 30$,Recommended
Honestly one of the best games i've played it's really fun and even better with friends,Recommended

Words cannot describe how much I love this game right now I simply cannot get enough of it.Personal ThoughtsThis game caught my eye from a few streams I've watched. The longer you survive the more tense it gets. Just watching the match's total player count drop the zone get smaller and hearing constant gun battles in the distance makes all the more thrilling.I've constantly lost so far mostly straight away because I feel like I can take on the world with my fist! All I can say is do that in the open. Because following a player into a house will always end badly at the end of their gun barrel. But I love learning from it how I can approach everything better and more discretely just try and better myself for next time.I would recommend playing with other people friends hopefully because that alone makes matches more funny. But if you like the solo challenge taking on a server of 100 people coming out on top above all the rest then I highly recommend this adventure for you. You'll laugh cry and scream in rage. But always go back to hitting that 'Play' button on the main menu after a match.Performance GabberThis game is quite the RAM Goblin at the moment I have had a few crashes because it just consumed too much RAM so bear that in mind when setting the quality levels of your game at this point. Fingers crossed this will be improved upon in the future but other than that it runs like a treat. Not much server lag at all during matches I've played which is nice.Sadly at this time 03 Apr 2017 you can lower the foliage settings so there are pretty much no bushes or tall grass to hide in. Which is a shame because I would like to do this more often. Thought I have heard this won't be an option in the future so every one will have the same details as one another. This just means some people will have an advantage over others when in the more open areas and the farm fields.Happy hunting people!,Recommended

In a year full of amazing games Playerunknown's Battlegrounds has been the stand out title for me.The tension excitement thrills moments I've shared with peers the highs and lows have made PUBG one of the best multiplayer experiences I've ever had. It's so easy to take one look at the game and think that it's just 'another' military shooter but it's so much more than that. Playing on your own is tense and terrifying at times but the game completely changes when playing with peers. Duos and Squad modes are tremendous fun.There's a reason as to why this game continues to break records and it's very much worth your time whether that be on your own or with people you know.,Recommended

A game claimed it is still early access when 10m copies sold for a price of 27.The earlier you bought the more money you would have earned from this game.The crate system is a perfect example of marketing and designing failure or even disaster to some extent.They should hire a finance or economics student for the crate system.,Recommended
"Product received for free. Easy game to jump into if you have some spare time.UPDATE 5/7/18 I like playing solo because it allows you to jump back into the next game right away if you die (1 Man Squad). I like PUBG because you are constantly on the go. The game gives you a realistic survival siituation where you have to layout your strategy as soon as you're in the plane with a visual of the map. You have to think of a stragedy for the items you pick up to the weapons you ""craft"" along the way to the environment (trees hills grass bushes buildings sounds etc.) around you.",Recommended

Fun game that you can play for just one round or multiple. More fun with friends. Keeps you at the edge of your seat.,Recommended
This game definitely is a cruel mistress. The game at times can be laggy buggy and cheaty. In most cases that would send many running for the hills but this game definitely is an exception. The reason people keep coming back for more even though they run the risk of running into these issues is simple The game is fun. Now of course this game shines brightest when you have a merry bunch to play with but solo play is still a decent amount of fun. If you are looking for a game for your group then this is definitely the game for you! Now if you don't have a group to play with this game becomes a little less fun to play and I would recommend playing with some randoms until you find some people you really enjoy playing with. If the battle royal genre doesn't interest you or you have no interest in finding people to play with you that's fine it just means the game is not for you.In conclussion I would say that this game is an absolute ball with friends. A moderate amount of fun without them. Leaving the only drawback is the problems of an unfinished unoptimized game. On the brightside though the devs aren't done with it and it has gotten better since I initially started playing it.,Recommended
to much hacker's But fun to play,Recommended
Shouldn't be full release recent updates seem extremely rushed for console releases. Awfully optimised don't even bother trying on a low spec PC or console.

"The most fun and least buggy ""battle royale"" game on Steam.",Recommended
It is a very good game and i find it fun to play by yourself and with friends. Its my favorite game so far. The only thing i would say is that there are som bugs. I strongly recommend you to buy this game.,Recommended
Really fun &amp super addicting. Unlike most I have thankfully had no major issues regarding performance nor cheaters (so far) but seeing how many people are actually complaining about these things it certainly needs to be put into consideration before buying. Other than that the shooting in the game is generally really fun and feels realistic and theres also a good variety of weapons and there are a lot of attachments that you can find for them as well. Graphics are OK but there is however a blatant lack of color and textures generally look really bland and boring. It's not the worst I've seen though but something I feel could be improved in several ways. Matchmaking is really fast and you find a game within seconds. You should expect a lot of campers especially in solo play but since the entire game is based around strategy (not RNG... *cough cough*) camping becomes a natural part of the games' basic strategies and isn't something at all I feel troubled by (since I do it myself lol). As of right now the game has properly balanced gameplay and there is thankfully no gun that feels overpowered or that is necessarily alot better than most. Winning in this game is the greatest feeling in the world and honestly not a feeling a lot of games can make you achieve.Overall really fun and a game I can definitely recommend.,Recommended
This game is easy to pick up and is a lot of fun.Microtransactions are only bad if you make them they obviously don't effect the game.,Recommended

"I bought this game quite early and i must say its been quite a ride. i rarely ever drop a review and if i do its normally not anywhere near this detail. if your considering buying this game here are some of the pro's and con's i find most important in this game.Pro The game constantly manage to bring new scenarios be it the gunbattles you have or the lootgame you run.Con Poor client side hit detection or ""CSHD"" you might experience getting shot through a wall or someone exploiding CSHD because pubg is still in an early phase (https //www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/69h6sx/client_side_hit_boxes_ruining_the_game/) *Disclaimer. Cheaters have also posted on above link. The link is only to prove my point of CSHD not promoteing cheating in any way.*Pro The game has a very unique balance between realism and fantasy. Even tho no man would stand after 6 bullets from an AR no matter how much bandage or how many syringes he's got however the aiming strategic camouflage travel speed and distance all makes it far from most FPS games like battlefield Call of duty or even games like Rust.Con Even tho the realism is great the stability of the servers limits the ability to spawn grass and some bushes at larger distance (500m+ less for grass) makeing it mostly useless to use open fields or tall grass to hide in unless in a small circle. Pro Most of the game is based on RNG (Random Number (or item) Generation) this is allows for the scenarios described in first ""Pro"".Con The RNG can seem unfair at times a lot of the game is based on luck makeing this game not as skill based as Counterstrike or League of Legends thereby also makeing it ""Esports unfriendly""Pro The game features both 3'rd and first person gameplay which both are almost uniqe experiences and diffrent playstyles.Con PUBG still doesnt allow you to choose what maps you prefer to play. in my personal experience 3'rd person gameplay on ""Woods"" map is kinda fun as the terrain disallows you from exploiding the camera for very long distances. However the ""Desert"" map becomes nothing but a camper infestation in third person. On the other hand the desert map is very enjoyable in first person as you get to have medium to long range gunbattles more regulary contrary to the ""Woods"" map where things in first person can seem slightly annoying if the circle ends in tall grass and you end up proneing your way arround for serveral minutes. Also the amount of terrain on the ""Woods"" map in first person can become a bit of a nursance in my opinion.Overall i would certainly recommend the game even with its current limits and flaws this game is still young and constantly improveing.",Recommended

It should go without saying that the game will be way better with firends but I've managed to meet some pretty cool randoms with our team and we even almost won with 2 randoms my friend and I. I will say I had to turn shadows to medium to get truly smooth gameplay with my stock clocked GTX 980. But the devs have been doing optimisations a lot and I've been noticing a nice difference. All in all a good game that offers great replayability when you want to shoot people! ),Recommended
Such a wonderful game. 10/10 would play again,Recommended

Good game with 600 hours in i saw almost everything theres a problem with the chinese players in EU servers and alot of them are hackers there isnt much development they are coming with some maps but not with too many guns i think they are being held up by the servers for the rest great team game good tactics nothing wrong with it for the rest,Recommended
it's fun,Recommended

This game is amazing these devs did a good job making this after playing h1z1 for 3 years this game is the number 1 fps shooter game,Recommended
Product received for free. it a nice game,Recommended
Already has more to offer than H1 and is from the creative mind behind the BR game mode himself. If you are wondering how this is different than H1 and the Arma BR in terms of gameplay I would say it lands somewhere in between the two. Not super arcade like H1 but not hyper realistic like Arma. Looking forward to the future development for sure.The only thing that H1 and PUBG have in common is the game mode (Battle Royale).PUBG Better graphics Way better gunplay Cars aren't OP (You have to slow down before you jump out or you will get hurt) You can actually run people over with cars More gun variety (They have already added a new gun since the closed beta) Weapon attachments,Recommended
the best battle royale game ive come across realistic in all ways but does need optomising and with their timelines showing a 6 month early access and optomisation period this game is gonna go from strength to strength. its alot slower paced realistic and tactical then h1z1. throughly recommend if you have an older pc id recommend waiting till full release after the optimisations have been completed,Recommended
10/10 would bang,Recommended

Game is good for a while of course it gets stale playing on the same map for several months but hey. A good game if you're a casual player.,Recommended
very fun game not always about take everyone out somtimes you got to sit them out i highly recomend trying it out,Recommended
Pretty good.,Recommended
when i bought this game in EA i wasnt sure if i was going to like but after playing the game for a while i would consider it one of my favourite multiplayer titles. whilst the game can be dull turning into running simulator 2017/18 from time to time the moments of adrenaline that can be found in reaching the last few and in some fire fights more than makes up for it. the game is best experienced with friends although the decrease in BP for duos and team is an irratant so would deffinatly recomend if you have one or two friends to play with. overall a fun game and well woth the purchase especially if you can get it bellow its standard price,Recommended
It's a nice game i r8 11/10,Recommended

It's cool dude.... Rocking,Recommended
Good game,Recommended
The game has a great map reminds me of cities that have been under liberal control for the past 20 years,Recommended
The new update has really optimzed the game earlier i admit it was not playable in a pc with ram less than or equal to 8gb but now it works fine but still there are a lot optimaztion to be done before we can say that the game will work smoothly,Recommended
Very good game,Recommended
This game is a great concept but with the 2 recent updates as of 4/27. The game is almost unplayable due to lag and crashes (cant write memory errors). Hit detection is still horrid unless you get a head shot and some weapons still need to be balanced correctly(fine tuning really)Playing issues aside when you do get a good round without the game being forced to close it can be a blast and leave you feeling like your heart is about to burst out of your chest! This game still has a ton or work to be done to it to make it a great game. It has the foundation now lets see if Bluehole can correct build something on that.,Recommended

"Pretty fun but way to overrated. It isn't THAT good. Just a simple ""survival of the fittest"" kind of games. Also as of right now the game is poorly optimised. I could run metro last light on ultra with 60 fps but I have to run this game on 720p very low to make it playable. In large cities I still have around 15 fps not so great to aim with.",Recommended

This game... you love and hate at the same time addictive like nicotine and works the same...11/10 would get panned to death again a must try,Recommended
This game is just great I tell you. Addicting as heck! I tell you!,Recommended
Lets make this straight....it still needs a lot of game modes rather than the current modes and to the dev team please install in a playback mode where you can observe previous games so that we could become better survivors on the game pretty please??i give it 8.8/10. ),Recommended
The game is incredibly fun. There's a certain simplicity to the concept of the game and it just works wonderfully well. While it does have a few flaws in terms of optimisation it's nothing that ruins the overall joy to me at least.Give it a go especially if you have a few good friends to group up with! ),Recommended
Great game just be aware that your video card matters more then your ability!,Recommended
Good game so far. The shooting system is nice match making is good and you can play alone or play with your friend as a team. Howerver I found it has a problem with performance. I'm using i7 4720hq Ram 16GB and GTX 970m but I need to keep the medium setting in order to run the game in 60fps. Hope this game keep improving and releasing soon.,Recommended
Have you ever wanted to induce an aneurysm without years of bad diet??? Look no further. This game will frustratingly drive you over that cataclysmic edge past the boundary of a safe and healthy blood pressure level. Now you can age years in just mere hours! It's also very fun to play with friends... I've heard... Assuming they can carry you through to the endgame.,Recommended
play it if you're not gonna be some crybaby writing reviews bashing the game because they cant handle skilled play and strategic thinking and will say fortnite is better because they like rng damage and 1 map ) its a pretty decent game lol,Recommended
game rn is meh smaller map is fun performance is ok overall its worth it if you like games like this.,Recommended
PUBG is a great and fun game. It's constantly changing and evolving and it's especially great with friends. The hackers however.... Recently PUBG has run into a hacker crisis. As a daily player of this game I consistently run into people slamming 10 rounds into my head with a UMP. Yesterday alone my team and I ran into hackers in 3 consecutive games. We observed 2 aimbotters and 1 ESP hacker (I was hiding behind a ridgeline and the guy knew exactly where I was). I just don't understand how a Battleeye protected game has so many hackers. I love this game but get your together Bluehole.,Recommended
This game is the ultimate tactical battle rotal ! Also in many ways it is also one of the most scariest intense games around now. Could CS lose the crown to the pressures of not just Siege but now Pubg with its raw humble grass roots foundation? Remember CS has the same beginning story ) technically until CS source came out the game was a Half life mod. Pubg ftw but all the CS games will always have a place in my heart.,Recommended

very fun game to play with your friends or some random strangers. Game is intense and fast paced . It however needs to be optimized better and hopefully in time it will. I recommend playing as long as you turn the graphics down so your pc does not explode.,Recommended
Im reviewing this right before early access to look cool its a fun game if you cant render the game its not the games fault entirely you are also partially to blame dont downvote and give this game a terrible review because your computer cant run this game it just isnt an honest gameplay review.with all that said this game is really fun I would recommend giving it a try especially now that its coming out of early accessI will make a lengthy review later. Again I just wanted to review during early access to look cool,Recommended
I play this alot with my friends i love it.,Recommended

lots of fun exciting ... nice rounds between 1 minute and as long as you can survive ),Recommended
awesome game great to play with freinds and try to kill other players,Recommended
I rarely recommend early access games but PUBG is definitely worth checking out. The gameplay is highly entertaining despite occasional bugs. 100 players drop onto an island scavenge for gear and fight until there's one person (or squad) left. During the game the playzone will move and shrink forcing players to move closer together. The longer you survive the tenser it gets and winning a game can feel like a true victory.,Recommended
the game is awsome,Recommended

It is very funny.But I think its optimization needs to be strengthened.,Recommended
Love this game very much a shooter with a couple of great maps to play if they sort the lag issues out this would be superb. They are always updating so fingers crossed very soon it will be perfect P 8.5/10. Sort the lag and add more things it will be a 10/10,Recommended
"So far good game but there is ""BUT"" hackers connection problem(sometimes) and when reconnect you don't get coins even when win(happened 2 times) strange vechile physic strange loot random sometimes there is nothing at big houses or 3 lvl armour helm +AKM at small house D8/10",Recommended
Even though the game is 'released' it still does not feel like the revenue from it was put into the game. The game has one of the greatest ideas in years but the execution does not quite work. The UI feels sticky as does the character. Aiming and using the gun's sights appear in different locations. These are just examples of what kind of core features are off.,Recommended
Bought game a while back played a few solo rounds hated it and refunded. Fast forward to yesterday when two friends picked up the game so I bought it again and decided to give it another shot. I'm glad I did. This type of game is great if you are playing in a 2 or 4 man squad. Teamwork on comms makes it a lot more fun. I can say that I am hooked now. 9/10 (needs to be optimized better),Recommended

I have played this game for day straight. Sadly with my brain being small none of that was recorded on my account but rather my my friend's brother's account. If you get passed all the bugs and glitches in this game it is a VERY fun and addicting game. But I am obliged to tell you all my misfortunes for you to make smart and personalized purchase. When parachuting you can smack something with no effect or you lightly tap a cliff and fall to your doom. (Yes this happened to me) In another instance I got by mortorcycle stuck and started reving it. The sound started to break and partner told me I was breaking the game. Out of nowhere the bike blows up killing me instantly. This one was on me.I have been suspended in mid air a few times. Just simply delaying my landing. These bugs can be triggering to some but I find it easily to pass by.The game makes you rely on luck sometimes. Like who gets a gun first and what gun you get. You may be the one to get a lvl 3 helmet or you might be that person with nothing but a crowbar. But no matter what gear you have the game always seems to keep the excitement ever lasting. Whether running directly through the Red Zone(an area under artillery fire) or out sprinting the the blue force field your heart will be racing. I have heard of hackers infesting the game however I have seen none. I have seen a lot of Chinese on NA servers. Most of them speak enough English that you can get through squad matches with full teamwork. Finally I have to reccomend this game for all the fun I had in the time I played. I even bought it for a friend and got some friends of mine to get it. In their 5 hours they even said it was worth it.P.S. The game isn't optimized for sh*t.,Recommended

PUBG isn't perfect. It obviously get some flack for being unoptimised and having awful servers. Bluehole does their best and the improvements they've been making have been making the game MUCH better. They listen to community feedback. This game isn't as bad as people say it is. Give it a try if you haven't. You won't regret it. The game functions as your basic battle royale but offers more tactical and slow paced gameplay then games such as Fortnite. This slow paced gameplay doesn't detract from the paranoia or tension you might feel though. It can be over in a second if you make a mistake i.e. stand still for way too long. Sure you might get mad at the game but in the end you always come back.,Recommended
Pretty toxic but its pubg so play it.,Recommended

If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples peeled cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double crust pie Directions 1.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 (1 inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter sugar mixture over top of pie coating the lattice and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until the crust is golden brown the caramel on the top crust is set and the apple filling is bubbling 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Eat.,Recommended

This game is amazing I got hooked since my first drop in! The suspense up sneaking up on someone and blasting them along with you trying to stay alive to get that Wnner Winner Chicken dinner! With a great huge open map with towns and small complexes full of loot to the gas closing in on you as time progresses this game is all around fun. You literally want to try and stay alive and play strategic wether it's everyone man for himself or your playing with some buddies. Definitely reccomend its an insanely fun game!,Recommended

"So here's a quick review for an early access Battle Royal game. Pros 1 This game is absolutely addictive. Whether you get into a good match or a bad match you 99% of the time find yourself smashing that ""Play"" button in the hopes that your next match is either better or just as good as your last one. There's just something about it that catches you no matter if it's from the feel of the gunplay or the hilarious things that can happen while in a match. Solo Duo or Squad they're all equally fun.2 The map that is available currently is very well made. There are nice building layouts plenty of terrain barriers to use during combat (excluding open areas which if you get into a gunfight there just remember that YOU chose to go that way) and is big enough to feel large but not so large as to make you feel like you're in some empty land that you have no hopes of seeing anyone for the entire match. 3 The animations feel good overall. Sure there is a little clunkyness here and there and the random arm flail during reloads from time to time with certain weapons but it feels smoother than it's influence which would be Arma. Running jogging crawling leaning. The basics are there. While there is no active adaptive cover system you can find ways to make cover out of just about anything. 4 The development is promising. With the developers offering frequent updates even if they be small ones they are constantly working on the game. This is fantastic when buying into an early access game as you want to see the money you spent on it being used to improve the game. The game has made leaps and bounds since it was opened for everyone to try out and while some people dislike certain changes...they've been working. You won't always be happy with every change or update that's released but the idea that this is an active work in process makes it feel so much better to invest time in.5 The assortment of weapons is ""okay."" But there's not an overly abundant amount of different weapons and once you've used all of them at least once you kind of get a pick of favorites and ones you just absolutely won't touch. 6 Avatar customization though a little limited adds a bit of personal appeal to the game. You don't just hop in as a bland avatar and run around with the same clothing and hairstyle you get to choose small details. Hair. Hair color. Face. Clothing. Etc. This is a great way to personalize yourself in game and I really hope we get to see more on this in the future. 7 The Physics...are entertaining. While not polished they are effective at doing what they do working decently and causing some hilarious situations. Have you ever crossed a bridge on a motorbike and went flipping 3 miles into the air at mach speed? Well you just very well might playing this game! And while this can be a negative I can tell you that when you're playing with friends it's absolutely hilarious. 8 Ambient noise is good. I play this game with a Logitech Artemis G633 headset and I have to say that what I hear really gets me into the game. It gets me involved with my surroundings. With the weather footsteps fading gunfire based on distance vehicle noise reload sounds swimming and even breathing/basic character noises. It all sounds good. 9 Match times are good. This will vary based on how quickly other players die as well as the choices you make. You can either land and get killed instantly or you can end up in the game for a half hour for a single match. It all comes down to how you play luck and aim. Wanna play the sneaky silent type that pops up at the end of the game to pop off the game winning shot? Want to run in guns blazing hopped up on energy drinks and try to mow down everyone in that two story red building? You can do it. And it can all effect just how long you're in a match obviously. Cons 1 Lack of weaponry is a thing. The guns get a little stale and boring after a while. You usually end up with the same loadout match after match and it can just get frustrating that we don't have a bigger assortment of weapons. With a game based entirely on gunplay the most out of left field thing that's available is a frying pan or a machete. I'd really like to see more weapons added on a more regular basis. From your basic AR15's to more obscure weapons like .22 rifles ballistic shields and more bullpup styles. 2 Bland sights is also a thing. Considering that the current map seems to be centralized in Russia (I think) I would assume there would be an assortment of russian style sights. Where are my Chevrons? Where is my height finder so I can use it to figure out how far out the enemy is before I take a shot? The sights besides that little thing are a bit irritating considering that they zoom in your entire screen instead of just the scope lense itself. I would like to see more realistic sighting for the optics instead of just zooming in the entire screen. It adds a weird advantage to trying to take aim on an enemy when you can see his buddy standing 15ft to his right because you can also see outside of the scoped area with full zoom.3 Lots of clothes lack of armor/functionality. This...bugs me a lot personally. In the game there are helmets and vests that offer body protection. That's it. However there are gasmasks ballistic masks and backpacks with metal padding on them that offer no form of protection. In fact they only increase your hit box. Get shot in the backpack that's sticking out behind the tree? It's like you got shot in the back. The level 2 backpack has a large metalic drag plate on the bottom that functions as if it's cloth. The ballistic mask offers no protection. The sunglasses/goggles offer no protection from flashbangs. I feel like they could step this up to add in things like concussive protection if you're wearing a full helmet or mask. Or perhaps even slow the rate of health loss if you're out of bounds and have a gasmask equipped. Offer back protection based on how many items you have in your backpack. Or even allow the items in the backpack to become damaged if the backpack is shot which would make people think twice about shooting it if they're trying to kill someone to loot them. 4 Overall game performance is sketchy. Before this week I was running an overclocked 8320be Setup on a Sapphire 7970xt that was also overclocked. The game would crash regularly. It was unplayable over low settings. The tab to inventory function would cause momentary lag and hangups. In order the play this game in a way that made it feel optimized I had to step up to a Ryzen 1600 32gb of RGB Trident and a 1080 GTX FTW2. This is a lot of money to drop just to see a game feel optimal to play. (And before it's said I play games of various qualities and I wanted to upgrade anywho. I didn't drop that cash just for this game.) That being said people who don't have hardcore or enthusiast based machines may have quite a bit of trouble playing this game so if you just have a hobby setup...you may want to wait for the game to get optimized before investing the money.5 The physics are just as much as con as a pro. You can expect to see grenades bounce into oblivion. Your body to clip through walls objects not render. Be driving down a flat road and unexpectidly stop and explode like you hit something. The motorcycle you're on can go sailing into space and further into the beyond. It happens.Recommendation? Overall I have quite a few hours in this game. It's a top selling game and one of the if not the topped streamed game currently. It's addictive. It can get competitive. Teammates can be funny and very good. Or bad. Whatever. If you can run this game get it. It's fun. You'll love it if you like shooting people. This game adds that ""Ahhh that felt good"" feeling to your heart when you get a good kill. Winning a match is even better. Just do it. You'll have fun I think if you like shoot em up games.",Recommended
"I havent played this game very much but i still think its pretty amazing and i like to win and i do it alot. maybe little bit too easy to win but i think others dont have this same problem becouse im just too good with my friends jk. my friends are good and i suck like my mom did when she was my age. all and all i recommend this game to just about anyone its alot of fun we played with my pal like 15hours last sunday and we had alot of fun. so if you have friends you will like this but if you dont have any well.. go outside and make some.

Great game mine experience has been seamless but i can't say the same for my friend. When he tries to connect to a game it's a fihty fihty between black screen or connect.The game itself is loads of fun but don't take it too seriously. I don't this will become a e sport cause it's not that competitive. There's no really ranking system and the skill diffrens between a player with over 100hours and one with 15hours isn't that big compared to a game like DOTA 2 or CSGO.,Recommended
As it is still an early access game it is overall great. With more attention given to the game such as adding new maps enhancing optimizations blah blah youve read other peoples reviews its a good game and that's that.,Recommended
"I have enjoyed playing this game and I wanted to write a review to share my thoughts with others who are looking to purchase the game. I have broken my review down into the Pros Cons some other thoughts and final thoughts Pros 1. Playing online with friends One of the best parts of this game is playing online with your friends. I cannot begin to count the amount of times I have laughed out loud while thrashing around the map in a vehicle. The vehicles are definetly very fun. Online co op with friends adds the fun of playing with friends to the intensity of the survival aspect. 2. Two different maps (Maybe more soon????) The two maps cater to different playstyles and suit different people. The Erangel island map I feel especially caters to beginers and can help one learn the strategies needed to win. The quantity of smaller compouds allows for a safer looting strategy for newcomers yet the presence of larger and more popular buildings like the school provide for the nessesary action for more experienced players. The desert map Miramar tends to have more medium size compounds and less of the more popular and less popular areas. Sure there are high action loot spawns thoughout but it seems as if the Water Treatment plant and Hacienda de Patron (From Miramar) never compare to the school (from Erangel). Nevertheless I enjoy playing both maps. 3. No Pay to win I really like how this game has not been infected with the pay to win bug. The only thing that costs money are crates that you can buy and sell on the Steam Market. Crates have clothing in them but nothing that gives people any advantage. In fact with the battlepoints you earn during the game you can earn crates and even sell them on the Steam Market. I am not a particularly good player but as of now I have earned back $13.38 of the game price by selling the crates I earn in game. Cons 1. Rubberbanding As of the time I am making this review rubberbanding is still an issue on the servers. The development team has made monumental strides in reducing reubberbanding with the full release of the game but it is still prevelent in the early game. It is always very frustrating when you pick up a gun see the looting animation and hear the shuffle of your character pick up an item only to find that immidietly after you picked up your gun your character was slightly shifted out of range to pick up the bullets on the ground. The squatting animation will have already played for each little bullet box but they will somtimes not show up in your inventory. This phenomenon is probably a little confusing to explain somtimes it gets irritating. Rubberbanding also gets annoying if it happens when you are driving but it seems much rarer than it occuring while running. No other major cons right now. I may add some later if I think of it or somthing comes up Other Thoughts It will run on most systems When I first purchased the game it was still very unoptimized and I didn't have a particularly powerful PC. I was playing on an older prebuilt system that I had upgraded with a graphics card. The specs were an i5 650 an 3.2ghz (yes a first gen hyperthreaded dual core) 6gb of 1333mhz ram and a gtx 1050ti. With the old specs on very low settings I could still get a playable 45 fps. Obiously the framerate was not that high but it was pretty consistent for me and I never had major frame dips or drops. I have since upgraded the processor to an i7 870 and optimization patches have been implemented. With new optimization I have been able to increase the quality settings and achieve 50 80 fps depending on the environment. I know that range is quite big but I have noticed different parts of the map have a significant impact on framerate. Hackers Apparently hackers are a big problem on more Eastern and Asian servers but I have never come in contact with any hackers while I have been on the North American servers.Hacking is a very controversial topic and even though I have never encountered a hacker it has significantly affected me. I was banned from PUBG for supposedly hacking and a ""Game Developer"" ban was placed on my steam account. They apparently detected some sort of cheating program on my computer. If you are unfairly banned you can make an appeal on the official PlayerUnkown's Battlegrounds forum in the ban appeal section. If/when you do make an appeal make sure to explain yourself well. Two or three sentences won't cut it. I had a few paragraphs and evidence that there could not have been any sort of ""cheating program"" on my computer. I am glad that they are working to remove unwanted cheaters from the game but don't be afraid if you accidently get banned. Final Thoughts (This is the tl dr part) This game is fun and action packed. I would highly recomend playing with your friends even gift it to them if they're stingy. $30 is a great price for a new game especially considering the price of other AAA games that have been out for years and still in the $60 range. Don't worry to much about the ability of your PC to run this game. As seen before I started out with a low spec rig and was still able to have fun playing it. This game is definetly worth your money and I highly recommend it.",Recommended

I've never teleported back in time so much,Recommended
I bought PUBG a couple of weeks ago mainly missing the big hype wave. The large amoutn of negative reviews the game has recently received had me worried about the game in general. However if you've seen video of the game being played and thought it looked fun it is still that game.PUBG has a fairly steep learning curve I spent my first few games hiding in bushes and going to extremely obscure houses only to get murdered the second I came across another more experienced player.After a couple of weeks of playing I feel much more comfortable with the game and it's become a genuinely very enjoyable experience though currently only one map you can have a pretty large range of 'game types' depending on where you land and how you play.Yesterday the beginning of my game consisted of two guys chasing me around a tree in their UAZ while someone else took pot shots at all 3 of us it was pretty funny.The more you learn the game and get used to it's controls/mechanics the more fun you will have which I think is a big plus missing from a lot of titles that come out these days.I'd recommend this game to anyone who enjoys PVP fps and to an extent the rpg esque draw of finding loot in your environment. I'd especially reocmmend it if you have a friend or two to play with as that makes the game even more fun.,Recommended
AMAZING.,Recommended
ok,Recommended
This is the good so good its but its good. Get this game now!,Recommended
Soooo I've got a few hours into this game now I feel like I can review it. First off I do recommend this game. A lot of people are saying no because they are upset that the dev added micro transactions. But I personally don't care because if you actually care about what your person looks like in the game that's kinda silly because it's really only you who will ever actually know what you look like because combat happens very fast in close quarters or at range where you can't tell if the person has black or brown fingerless gloves.Anyway The game itself is very fun and very addictive. Every match is different because every match everyone starts from scratch. Scavange new guns clothes etc. I've had matches where I need to search 4 buildings just to get a handgun with some extra rounds and others I've dropped onto a house that had everything i could possibly need.I've had multiple rounds now that I've made it to top 10 and 1 match where I came in 2nd. Let me tell you you've never been more dissapointed for coming in 2nd place in your life. You fight you survive all this time and with the playable field getting smaller just to get it stripped away last second.There are some down sides controls can be a little clunky and sometimes picking up items can be a pain if they're too close to each other on the floor. But overall for an early access game I've been very surprised at the overall quality.as it is right now I'd give it an 8/10. It's an extremely fun game but it does have some flaws that keep it from being astounding. However those will likely be addressed at some point between now and official release.,Recommended
game is so good .. but too many hackers (,Recommended
Still in early access and plenty of updates but I have never had a game crash / freeze more than this game does (At this point it's every match either at the start or during the middle of a game which is more frustrating). If you're able to stay connected throughout the game it's a great shooter to play with friends or solo.,Recommended
fun but too many hackers....also please add more gun,Recommended
Takes a while to get acquainted with the game mechanics compared to h1z1 I'd say gameplay wise it lands somewhere inbetween h1z1 and arma in terms of movemement and gunplay very satisfying to shoot with most guns especially when they're fully kitted with attachments.The game has a frying pan as a viable weapon.,Recommended

PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS...PUBG is a last man standing shooter where players must fight to find weapons and supplies.You can play solos by yourself play with a friend in duos or play as a squad with four friends.The game has some events that start at a scheduled time and skins for clothes and guns that you can buy if you really want to but they don't really effect the game.But the game is not perfect at all...Theres many glitches like when your driving on a flat surface with your car and you suddenly hit a invisible object and your car explodes and you and your friend just die.If the game developers just fixed these glitches and didn't add skins in to the game it would be much enjoyable to play.I myself really only enjoy to play with a friend or two because I don't really like to play a game like this just by myself but its just my personal opinion.,Recommended
I got the game relatively around the time it originally came out in early access and I initially thought it was an alright game. I've never been a fan of the worn out old grassy land scape themes in similar games and I definitely didn't care for it here. But here comes 1.0 with a slew of actual improvements on the game and a very refreshing map. I love the desert theme way more. It feels way more alive and interesting. The ability to climb over barriers and into windos ect. was exactly what I had been begging for. This game went from alright to pretty good for me and I can justify the 30 bucks I dropped on it now. Its a solid battle royale and worth your time if you like these kind of games.,Recommended

"How to succeed in PUBG 1. Spend $70 on some hotpants. Can't win if you don't dab on the haters2. Spawn in make sure you scream ""REGION LOCK CHINA"" before getting in the plane Brendan Greene is bound to listen eventually.3. Drop loot for 5 minutes get screwed over by the safe zone and find your nearest motorbike.4. After flipping 3 4 times and using your only boosters to stay at full health hunker down in the middle of the safe zone and play the waiting game. 5. After around 30 minutes of sphincter clenching gut wrenching action get shot through exactly 3 hills two walls and your fresh level 3 helmet by another player named PingGuo346. As you begin to tear up searching desperately for where you went wrong make sure to mutter ""region...lock...China..."" once more before the wails of sorrow overtake you.7. Hit that report button a few times just for good measure. There's no way it's as useless as the crash reporter right?8. Return to the menu and use your newfound 28BP to unbox 1/64th of the new desperado crate complete with a 1 in 1 000 000 chance to get the cool items!By the time you've repeated this enough to get a crate the day is over and you can lie your head softly against your pillow with satisfaction knowing that you've truly experienced the best 2018 has to offer for video games.",Recommended

I don't know what all of the negative reviews are about. Ever since the 1.0 release the game runs smooth as butter. I haven't experienced any bugs.

Right so here we go...PUBG Is a great game with many of the current popular game element like the surival and apocalyptic aspects and gave it a very unique twist which is highly addicting. I've played DayZ but that was just a little bit too slow paced for my liking. I didn't really feel a sence of purpose or direction of what to do there and could literally be walking for 8 hours and find a rotten apple and a shirt.PUBG Is fast paced and action packed with the red zone and the permitted fighting zone continuously getting smaller definately gives you a thrill and rush of adrenaline.HOWEVER Performance and Stability wise there needs be a LOT of improvement. And I'm getting the impression the DEVS have put their priorities in all the wrong directions. There are simple performance and coding issues which should be resolveable with a patch in a day.... Which now many of us players are having to arrange ''fixes'' for certain bugs issues ourselves.I know this is early access alpha whatever... But there are TONS of minor issues MORE important then streamers live streaming ETC. Try and fix these first before you start losing trust of your players and then move on to getting publicity etc. Nobody has ever becomes successfull promoting a broken buggy game.I mean is there still a ''DEVELOPMENT'' TEAM? or just a Marketing and Finance department?Anyway... That will be all for now. I'm still enjoying the game and I will keep playing as of yet... Just hope these issues don't persist too long and cause me and possibly many others to lose faith.Kindest regards Svenarchy.,Recommended

"This is probably the best game of its genre and will continue to be. It is an abusive relationship simulator. You commit to it give it money your life your heart and it throws you to the ground kicks you beats you doesnt care about your input and spits on your bruised corpse. Then it says ""Come back tomorrow ."" And you know what you do the next day? You come right back and say ""Give me more daddy"" and the cycle continues. Sometimes he will buy you presents and give you cosmetics as sort of an incentivization but its just a mask to cover the abuse.10/10 abusive relationship simulator",Recommended
"PUBG is one of my favorite games. I like the graphics and playing in First Person Perspective. I like this mode because it gives people an option whether they want skyrim perspective or csgo style. One thing I recomend to do in this game is have fun with your friends. My friends are silly they like team killing eachother stealing vehicles panning people creating small redzones of grenades and best of all just laughing at eachother. Remember to laugh at yourself. I started out by getting mad like ""OMG is he hacking?"" and sometimes people are. But now I can review my mistakes with the death cam feature and get better at positioning with my teammates and learn from my past experiences. I am glad they reworked the main menu options and now you can the pick maps. I enjoyed the fog maps in the past because they were fun it hilariously funny when I walked right over somebody in the middle of a fog map. I used to get angry if I died but now I can review how and say if he was cheating in my opinion or not. Nowadays people are getting better and better. If I get rocked in the back of the head by a sniper from 1km away I might be but I was impressed and I would say ""Dang that was a nice shot"" like yesterday. PUBG is a solid 9.2 out of 10 in my book. It might be for you as well and if you are new just remember to have fun even with randoms friends or even if it is just yourself. D",Recommended

So many people are downvoting pubg because of obvious decisions bluehole is making to monetize their game beyond its 30 dollar price tag. I get where many of these people are coming from but at the end of the day aslong as it does not effect actual gameplay I cannot be arsed. Sure there used to be a time where games would include these things in their games from the get go but stop clinging on to that because it simply makes alot of money for a company.But then the debates shifts to not many changes are being made to the actual games from netcode to game design. Ladies and gentlemen programming and making games require a truckload of time and resources. Pubg has come so far from when it started and its much better then it used to be. Coding in a shop and making new skins is relatively simple compared to messing around with game mechanics and the core code of the game. But we are all aware that the team that works on the store front and skins has nothing to do with the actual coding of the game. As for netcode its always going to be a iffy subject since there is alot of things that go into it I would suggest watching https //www.youtube.com/watch?v dOVwu517GmI this video it will hopefully enlighten you on the subject a bit.Next up is cheaters.... Really.. Yes they are there but bluehole definately is trying to make tolerable they will never ever get fully rid of them. Cheater excisted all the way back in the 90's and they have never been put to a full stop and now people expect bluehole to pull a magic wand out of their and fix the problem. Yeah good luck with that.Now these seem to be the main point that people burn the game off on for the moment. Is the game perfect hell no. But its not as bad people make it out to be. The gunplay is one of the best you will find the graphics are not battlefield like but are good enough for what its trying to do. But when pubg was created they had limited resources and trying to create graphics on par with a game like battlefield takes some serious know how and time investment something bluehole did and probably still does not have. The sounds are good although the sound system (knowing where shots are coming from ect) can be pretty wonky at times. As for gameplay I get it its not for everybody the skill level between players can be pretty steep so if you are not used to FPS games you are going to have a rough time. But for those that have that experience don't expect constant action from begin to finish all the way but it comes and goes without warning. But that why there is always that sense of danger hanging around. But when does hit the fan you will be satisfied coming out on top. Also I need to point out that if really want to you just take a vehicle and just look for trouble which usually does not take that long to find.I have some gripes with the game sure but for the time being I am enjoying myself when playing it. I get the feeling many might actually enjoy the game but are just salty about certain decisions blue is taking. Even though I agree with them in some extend I don't believe the game at its core is bad experience.,Recommended

Most of the people in the recommendations are just ing stupid. Game aspect Its good only problems i can name would be random server lag or delay in pick up of items. Community Wise its awesome people are on here to have fun and its great. Many discord servers and other communities willing to organize tournaments and other such events. All the people who are babies for paying for cosmetics are the babies themselves if you truly are having fun with this game you give two about that part of the game...And of Course the countless amounts of people disliking and making bad reviews about this game just because a couple of people who killed streamers and got banned or honked with a car nearby. NOTE these ing incidents happen months ago and the devs no longer ban players for just killing streamers because ive done it before and nothing ing happened (i killed summit1g) These people are actually realizing there in a game with a streamer opening twitch finding where they are and purposly troll them. I dont advocate for the streamers they know what theyre getting into and actually like the combat from streamsnipers now...My point is dont ing listen to these negative reviews over the opinion of two non related game aspects. Cosmetics and the stream sniping isuue. The game is fun it will get you pumped angry excited and scared. A worthwhile experience worth every penny....And other people reading my who disagree no one cares about youre bias opinion. You complaining about streamers whining is going to do anything.... People continously keep buying the game and is now the most played game on steam...Do yourself a favor and buy this game!,Recommended

What makes this game great is because of the immense amount of replayability. Its always a different story to tell after every round with different scenarios and people.

"Best Battleroyale game I've played so far and I had over 400hours on the Arma3 one too even with the bugs and glitches that are bound to happen in any early access games it's still hella fun to play and even more fun to play with friends.First person servers labbled as so and not ""Hardcore"" that always made players never play it in other BR games guns are great gameplay feels good although de sync still occurs it's not even close to Arma de sync.Overall I love this game !",Recommended

best game ever excluding counter strike,Recommended
fun in lobby for a while solo too boring.bad performance bad hitboxes lots of hackers bad community at all.servers shutting down almost everyday. lot of bugs etc.despite all of that the game is worth buying. selling in game crates gives enough to recoup the cost of the game itself. so if u want to try go on!UPD dont buy this ing Miramarsome1 tell to developers that Miramar is SO FREAKING DISGUSTING i dont want to play this game only cuz MIRAMARRRRRRRRRRRRRenough this UPD x2 ok now we can choose the map. not bad.,Recommended
Many hours spent not knowing where I'm getting shot from. 10/10.,Recommended

drop loot die repeat. Perfect,Recommended
The game is challenging . The map weapons are good. Met 4 or 5 cheaters during my 150+ hours gameplay so that is quite acceptable. Just keep working and improving on the anti cheat system and it will be alright. The devs are pretty good enough to keep the updates on Facebook or Reddit so we can get the news as soon as possible. But there is a issue that really bothers me which is the Server problem. 40% of the time you will get a server busy problem that is really annoying when you have friends teaming up to have some fun. Just solve the server problem as soon as possible. Another thing that is really annoying is the PUBG community Sure the cheating problem is there but the devs are working hard on it and they keep updating us on the Facebook which is really good for a game developer. If you guys really off of PUBG devs thn play DayZ and see whether the devs give a about you guys or not. And for the guys keep complaning about the cheating problem maybe it is just you suck in this game and blame on the cheaters a lot . Played with chinese players and they are really not that bad communicating is not a problem for me because i understand chinese too.7.5/10 for the game. If you are really want to have fun yourself or your friends this game is for you.,Recommended
Please fix your game. when people are running you LEAD your shots to catch them. but in this game for some reason you only get the shots in when you shoot behind them as they are running and that's not how guns or games work it is really annoying when people hit shot when they aren't even aiming right or in front of you.,Recommended
This game is highly addicting and very fun and engaging especially when played with friends duo or squad mode. a Few cons though as it is still early access. FPS drastically drops at least once a game and lasts about 30 seconds. Game crashes randomly although not very often Looting system some games you'll never find good loot in certain areasPros Killing people is very satisfying Realistic Camo Winning against 100 other players feels like having sex,Recommended

As of writing this review i have 3 hours on this game less than most people writing reviews but i think i have enough experience to write a review Pros Fun all throughout the match the game always keeps you on edge and there is stuff to do even in the last 10 people. Map is detailed there are many unique towns and cities which all contain different loot and rewards the bigger the place the riskier but more good loot the smaller less risky but less loot Wide variety of weapons There are many weapons you can pick up on your journey of the arena like machine guns pistols shotguns snipers and many blades Cons Server issues ive found myself dying from lag having my death delayed by 30 seconds Toxicity i have seen alot of toxic players on this game especially when i knock someone out they end up yelling swears and racial slurs for example the word n****r has been said alot Verdict There are things that can be improves and the community is a bit toxic but in my opinion the game is worth the buy and i would never go back on the purchase if i had the choice,Recommended

Okay so this game has two ing maps but it doesnt let you choose which one you want. And literally 99 percent of the time its the same map. Please give me a way to choose which map i want.,Recommended
Let me start by saying this is a great game. I love it as you can see by my 700+ hours played. You can see where this review is going. Hackers... EVERYWHERE! This game needs to be region locked. There is at least 1 hacker you come across about every 3 games. The people who are hacking are know to be Chinese and they have 3 servers to choose from and they always choose NA. The only way they can win is to hack. Get rid of them and this has the potential to be the best Battle Royale. Until then not so much.,Recommended
I've played for quite a bit and It's fun with friends. I'd like it more if Bluehole actually decided to work on the game though...6/10 Fun with friends if you can get over the bugs performence issues and bad graphics.,Recommended
Recommended for this game i know this game is still Early Access but Bluehole Studio always give some patch to improve this game,Recommended
I've been playing this game since May and I have to say that from the very beginning I was hooked. Not having played a battle royale genre game before It was one of the most exciting adrenaline inducing and overall fun games that I've played in a very long time. I'll even say that this is probably my favorite game to date. However in the last month I have experienced an excess of hackers/cheaters and it takes away from the entire experience. I've read the articles boasting the amount of cheaters being banned per day but it seems that almost half of the games that I play in a day end with being killed by an invisible player shooting my entire team out of a car with a shotgun or a flurry of bullets that instantaneously kill my entire team. I just hope that BattlEye can get ahead of these hackers so that everyone can go back to enjoying the game. Despite the people who are trying to ruin this game with cheating it is an excellent game that I would recommend very highly.,Recommended

Hey fix your f*cking game.Not going to lie we all love and hate PUBG. There is just something behind it that we all enjoy. From the game play the guns and getting to play with our friends and have a good time.Now recently.. the textures didn't happen to load in and I was teleporting around the whole area of Po i and then landed into a wall of a random house and then a man ran up to me and jumped punched me right in a the gabba. It gets to point where you think this game is good and ready for console. In what world is this game any ready for console and i know many people can agree with me on this. I am sorry for the little rant but in many ways we can all agree that this game need a little more fixing before it is realeased to the world especially on console.Thank you have a great day. In all though this game needs work and that is why it is still in beta. ),Recommended

I personally didn't like the game at 1st but i felt like the game had potential to become something great if u just put the hours into it. after playing the game for over 6 months i love it and it's not perfected but its getting there.

This is hands down one of the best games I've ever played period. I can say this after only 30 hours played through. The competition is tough atmosphere tense and you just have to go all in. gg,Recommended
As the label above this says this is an EA review so it will be modified when the game finally gets finished.When the game works well it's a blast fun as nothing else. When it doesn't though which is quite often it's frustrating laggy there's a lot of desynch and the fun that the game potentially can offer gets anhihilated. For now I'll give them the benfit of the doubt and mark the game as recommended because they DO seem like they're working hard and pushing patches and fixes very often. They got the money manpower and ability to make this into a great successful game here's hoping this project ends well and we finally get the Battle Royale game we deserve.,Recommended

It has it's problems but the majority will be fixed after the release of the game on xbox and for an early acces game it's pretty good and fun,Recommended
Overall I like this game a lot but I decided to make a list of pros and cons to help whomever this may concern with their decision.Pros Graphics not too shabby when turned up Lots of hours worth of gameplay Offers more intense and engaging play than any other game in the genre Offers all different styles of play so you can play how you want Never the same situation twice Great weapon mechanics Great map design Big map Fast Matchmaking Devs are constantly adding new guns vehicles mechanics and optimizationsCons Yes their are hackers here and there but I don't feel they affect my gameplay any more than the occasional aimbotter on any other shooters Yes it's poorly optimized my 4th gen i7 16gb ram and gtx980m run it around 35 42fps in heavy load situations and around 60 68fps in light load situations plan accordingly. Lots of racist micspam when you load in (fix this by pressing ctrl+t) You can spend 20 minutes peacefully looting only to be one shotted from an unknown location. (although I don't want them to get rid of one's ability to do that it's just frusterating sometimes)Overall I'd highly recommend it most of the problems are fixable or being fixed by the devs. It's really fun and you probably won't regret it.,Recommended
Wow just wow. Coming from h1z1 I was really sceptical about buying it. This game has been nothing but fun so far. Most satisfying kills in any game that I have experienced. Sounds great looks amazing teaming up with people over discord double the fun.You just can't go wrong with this if your pc can run it that is.Conclusion This game ed up my sleeping pattern.,Recommended

Great game worth the buy. Most the hate is over the lootboxes which just add cosemetics and have no effect on the game whatsoever. You can get some cosemetics for free so I don't know what the big deal is about. This was one of the first and biggest Battle Royale games before Fortnite came along and ripped them off and after Fortnite everyone seems to want to make a BR call of duty grand theft auto and tons of other random developers. Why are sooo many companies trying to copy PUBG? Because it is a great game that pioneered a new genre because hundreds of thousands (yes that many) people are playing it. They are still updating it fairly often. I was sceptical at first but after purchasing it I fell in love. This game is amazing. The graphics are great gunplay is phenomenal feeling of winning is the best. I have never encountered a hacker in all my 170 hours that I currently have logged. I don't know if people are just trash and are accusing people that are good of being hackers without even watching the killcam or what? I would really like to know because I don't see it. Maybe they see other reviews of people claiming there are hackers and they just want to jump on the hacker bandwagon I don't really know but this is a great game and I highly recommend it. 9/10,Recommended
193 Hours truly wasted. No to this game simply no. want more reasons read almost every review below,Not Recommended
"MAKE SERVERS REGION RESTRICTED! There's so many chineese people taking advantage of de syncing they just skip around the map. EDIT The hackers have infested the game not worth playing anymore. The fact that they have to make a plan to ""fix pubg"" should prove my point.",Not Recommended
reskin version of h1z1 kotk. taking the same path claim to be updating game and make no progress towards it. bring in new crates that require you to buy keys with actual currency but also have in game currency that is basically pointless. all in all win games get crates cant open crates without a key,Not Recommended
"Just at the current state that the game is in I can't recommend it to anyone right now. The hackers are what is ruining the game for so many people yes the glitches at times can be annoying but it's not a constant problem like Chinese hackers are. Seems like every other game you die from some BS hacker who isn't playing the game how it should be played. You need a better reporting system and create a region lock at least for now so you can really fix the problem. Region locks aren't ""xenophobic"" Greene they are necessary to make the gaming experience better for your players who put hundreds of hours into your game. It creates a better gaming community with better communication would reduce lag get a ridicoulus amount of cheaters out of the NA servers and create less stress knowing you are playing on a level playing field. You have the money you have the resources now fix it....I just want PUBG to be fun again.",Not Recommended
A very fun concept of a game. Very addicting. But outside of that I don't really have any nice things to say. I know its early access but it feels like the game devs have no idea what they are doing or how to improve the game or work on a bug that has been plagueing the game from the release of early access. You would expect to see improvement week over week especially given the fact they made close to or over half a billion in sales. But that is just not the case. The gameplay feels clunky at best. The graphics nowhere near optimized. And the game is riddled with bugs. And most of these issues have barely improved if at all since early release. Bluehole needs to improve fast or another dev team that knows what the hell they are doing will take up the realistic battle royale mantle. Once I actually see strides made to improve the game in a timely manner instead of just collecting money from the popularity of the game will I change my recommendation of this game.,Not Recommended
There are many delights with PUBG but also many problems and unfortunately the number of Chinese hackers and Chinese people in general flooding the OC servers ruins the entire game. It is impossible to find a squad where a single person speaks English let alone the entire squad.Add to that the frequent lag and number of glitches and while PUBG can be really fun it can also be entirely frustrating and out of your control.,Not Recommended
"I honestly wish I could refund this game... the only reason I even made it to 12 hours is because my friends keep nagging me to play with them otherwise the game does almost everything wrong.For starter take my opinion as a bias one because of 2 main reason I dont like Battle Royale and I hate the way the dev goes about trying to sue everyone base on the very idea that a its a new game gerne of sort and they are 1 of the first to put up a successful game (in term of sales and popularity not gameplay itself more on that later). Especially when PUBG itself are just a bunch of very generic props sticked together ESPECIALLY when PUBG themselves start off as a mod to Arma 3 not original content by any mean. And when anyone create a new game that even in the same gerne as them they go balistic with lawsuit and ""talk show"" to try to shut down the competitor instead of making their game better to compete with the other guys. That's not how you improve gaming as a whole you are holding it back instead.Now on to the game itself its buggy its littered with cheater/hacker its laggy its ran like even though it also look like even on a GTX 1070 of all things. The game basically dont evolve at all since the early access day other than guess what the addition of lootboxes and other ways to monetized the player. Now Im not saying that you cant look for more ways to get more money but when that's your sole focus instead of improving the game in almost anyway its a problem. And to top it all off its back to the dev problem again as they dont care at all about the opinion of the player and instead in face of complain they straight up insult the player calling them ""xenophobic"" because they dont want to play with ppl from like half the earth away who have high ping which ruin their experience with the game and concret evidence/statistic of the high amount of hacker over in China which the dev themselves called out in the past? Stop joking around. It also doesnt help that the hardcore fan of the game are all over the place trying their best to defend the game with things some straight up saying ""I dont care if they are wrong I still think PUBG is the best gamer ever"" which only serve to push the dev into an ""Apple mindset"" where they can do whatever wrong they want and everyone would still worship them anyway. So even though I dont like or play any Battle Royale game im kinda glad that alot of players are catching up to their BS and start moving toward Fortnite instead.So with all that said. No I wouldnt recommend the game. Both for their practice and their game itself. If you want to play Battle Royale I honest think you should try something else. Or better yet since the gerne is so new wait for something better that will come eventually.",Not Recommended
Complete trash it's popularity is only due to pandering to streamers. In it's current state it is rife with bugs and even on the beefiest rigs it will struggle to not get FPS drops or texture load in issues. Stay far away from this game.,Not Recommended
Piece of crap on EU servers since weeks. Heavy rubberbanding during the first minutes of almost every game is really frustrating. These lags teleport you several meters forward and backwards which is incredibly frustrating on early fights. The movement feels very imprecise and unresponsive if you come from CS GO it's a huge downgrade. Then there is a lot of luck involved in the game. RNG aim and circles.,Not Recommended

This game has given me adhd and i ask myself why?Its all because the shots dosnt register when are trying to kill someone. I'm still playing this game bcs all of my friends play this game and we are enjoying the first 15min. After the 15 min we are begining to get bcs the bad bullet register This is an perfect example You are in a house looting sudenly you hear steps on the right side. You look right and sudenly the enemy is on the left side with 58 other players with him. I start to spray him down with a AKM (keep in mind that im the persone shooting first) while aiming directly on him. I had my sight literally on him the whoal fight and what happend?? He killed me with first. I hade armor and everything. He had nothing but skins he got from his moms creditcard. Blueballs can do better if they just get they finger out and fix the soundsystem and where the bullet goes. I dont play fortnite but i can say that they are more productive then blueballs they are nonstop patching the game adding new things ect and its free meanwhile you pay 30euro for adhd increas playing with hackers from asian a shity soundsystem shity servers and attempting to break something or punching someone in the face ))).

"First off this game was really fun to play with friends and solo. i have put many hours into playing and have had so many great experiences with this game. But this game has MANY problems and downsides that i dont like. With the release of the new desert map i have played less because it is so The loot spawns/drops are god awful and there are not that many small areas to drop unless you go way off to the side of the map. The map is based around sniping which i do like but goodluck playing it withouth a sniper and experience. With the map having big citties/towns it leaves just the good players and the lucky ones to win the first fire fight and the newer players and unlucky players to die withing the first 5 min. The map also has a very annoying glitch in when you first dorp to a location and try to pick up loot it will not go into your inventory also you can not open doors or vault through windows. The old map is realy fun and i enjoy how even and spread out the loot is. There are fun places to drop like school Mili Prision and shelter. and small places to drop near the bottom half of the map. Another big issue with this game is that the lag and frame rate lag is extremely annoying. In the start of the match when every one is dropping in you can land and start rubber banding around trying to find a gun or you can be unlucky and have your parachute glitch out and stand frozen in the middle of the air for 5 10 seconds. Frame rate drops are very common if you dont have a beast computer and wont often be that high I my self have a gtx 1060 and only get 40 50 frames on very low settings. The devs do not do very good optomization updates and i havent experienced any major changes in my framerate since the newest update. (12/30/27) Many people complain about hackers being a big issue where i have only experience 3 with my 432 hours played on NA and AS. The wrost i have experince is guys using wall hacks and aimbot which is not that hard to counter if you are playing squad. Overall i do love this game and will still play with my friends but i do not think it is worth 30$ or worth getting if you have a crappy computer or no one to play with. Edit on (2/3/18) Game is still ing and will not load me fast into matches i am often loading in already in the plane or when the plane is halfway over the map already. Some times when i load in fast i have a glitch where i can only move faceing one direction and the only way to fix that is to restart the game. (3/23/18) game is filled with a lot of hackers and i dont see this game going any where. it was fun when i played and i had a lot of good moments. was worth 30$ but now i wouldnt pay anything more than 10 (7/4/18) I decided to play this game again and it still is but now i would say even worse the menue is sarting to look like a shity mobile game surrounding your menue new skin releases and a new ""battle pass"". i have a gtx 1060 3gb and i7 7700k and this game still doesn not want to run smoothly on my pc recently i have reset my computer because it was clutered and that didnt even help. Still no map selection and the guns they are adding are just reskins of the other guns and so far i have not found any map weapon exclusive guns even tho i havent played much so correct me if im wrong.",Not Recommended

Update It still sucks. Theres much better BR games out now. Tons of them.There's no valid excuse for the state of this game. Over 35 million people bought this game and they're still using generic graphics from the Epic Asset Store. The game has horrible performance issues even on high end systems due to anti cheat technology that doesn't even work.I'm not a fan of the 10 000 useless attachments they added to the game. Most of them make your weapon worse in some way or another.4 out of 5 games have hackers in them. It's out of control. I just can't reccomend this game anymore until the anti cheat system is improved (and that includes making it run better).

"I would recommend this game but I won't due to following reasons.1.) Horrible terrible optimization. Sometimes when landing on ground buildings aren't even fully rendered and I can just walk through walls and then it lags out or I get stuck. Overall optimization of the game is just awful. No excuse. I have a mid tier PC and I'm having huge issues playing this game sometimes. And I've heard people with beastly PCs sometimes can't run it smoothly on higher graphics.2.) Clunky. Game just feels clunky all the time. Sometimes you have to press mulitple times (interact) with a door for it to respond so it opens or closes. Picking up loot from the ground sometimes is harder than it looks. Gotta press ""F"" multiple times for my character to react and take the damn loot. Shooting sometimes feels clunky and movement of the game overall. Nothing feels nice and smooth.3.) Lootcrates in early access. I hate being that guy but I mean it's still early access. Focus on your freaking optimization instead of how to milk more money.I would keep on going but I prefer to stick with these 2 major issues above. Game has more issues from what I heard from veterans so read more reviews if you want info on those.Honestly this game has lots of potential. Just start fixing the god damn thing.",Not Recommended

Bad server performance and poor hit detection make this one of the clunkiest shooters I've ever played.

I can't recommend this game not after seeing the developers bury their head in the sand. I'm going to list some bullet points as to why I can't recomend the game then elaborate a bit more. Game updates very slowly since launch Game launched in a poor state They refuse to region lock the game which causes so many issues The game has more hackers than any game I have ever played The new map is very flawed in so many ways Some guns have visual feedback while others don't There is little point to using any other gun besides a rifle or sniper rifle and MAYBE the lmg the zone rarely closes in on areas that would give SMG and shot guns a chance. The game is poorly optimized Because the game has lootboxes it will always motivate people to cheatI deicded to uninstall the game and I refuse to play it until the devs region lock china or if their low priority queue actually helps (which I doubt honestly it doesn't help that much with dota 2)Don't buy the game if you don't want to deal with hackers and people with 400 ping it's just not a good experience play fortnite battle royal it's a far superior experience.,Not Recommended
Damn where do I start?It's a complete mess in terms of optimisation. Rubberbanding lag spikes loading issues. Even if you run a high spec setup you'll still suffer. Instead of fixing this they add in lootboxes and event passes sue the competition and remove proper map selection. China still remains region unlocked adding to the issue of cheating. The console port was a joke it barely worked.It's clear that the devs have given up and are trying to extract as much money as they can before the game dies. Don't let the hype from early access convince you that this game is good it's not. It seems that this is a repeat of what happened with The Culling the devs stopped listening to the community added cosmetics to a paid game and watched it die.Please take your money somewhere else.,Not Recommended
The base game is fantastic. The user experience is horrible. About 25% 33% of the time I'm dieing to automatic headshots from 200m+. This is their first shot after they have run up a hill or around a corner.

They ruined the feel of what pubg is supposed to be about. The good ol' near perfect version of the game with the exception of a little lag is gone and forgotten by the devs. They have our money and only released the game officially to prove that they can. The broke many things including the gradient of their visuals as well as their 3d sound which now works significantly WORSE than the EA version. I missed what pubg was and if that means that it would always be in EA then so be it. I just want the game to feel good again.,Not Recommended
"PUBG is fun but comes with many problems...I would hate to be the one who calls ""hacking"" when eliminated unexpectedly but there is definitely widespread suspicious activity.The new lootbox and keys are atrocious. The only sense of progression are spending battlepoints on loot boxes and then having to pay for a majority of them to be unlokced is not fair and quite predatory. The amount of battlepoints spent on loot boxes increases with the ammount of boxes you a buy in a week.For these reasons alone I believe the game progression and suspicious activity are enough for me to not recommend the game.",Not Recommended
I would love to recommend this game really I would.. But in the current state there are a few stupid bugs and weird mechanics. Firstly the hitboxes on the vehicles are absolutely rediculous and it's even worse when the person who runs you over is doing so at 2km h. Secondly I was playing a match and got into the top 10 fully geared out and on full hp when I decided I was going to climb a mountain BUT NO I fell through the a fully textured rock and couldn't move until the blue slowly enveloped me and I died. The game is great but in this current state I would not recommend it due to it's crazy bugs and weird vehicle mechanics.,Not Recommended

This game needs serious tweaking before I can look at it and say that this game does not look or feel like Early Access. Because right now this game is reminding me of DayZ. Every time i walk i just feel like a ing carrot carrying a gun vaulting is the most akward thing i've ever seen. And gun battles is giving my cancer. this game don't buy or play this until they actually put some effort into fixing it instead of adding stupid emotes.I am so sick of seeing these types of games being released half finished games were the rest of the game will either be added over time or sold to us as DLC (Star wars Battlefront) Sea Of Thieves is a perfect example. It's like they came to the board with the idea of an open world pirate game a few ideas for what to do and were then told to make the game and just add their other ideas later. I'm so sick of landing on two maps that i feel like i've played to death same guns and the few new ones that are added will most likely end up in an air drop so unless you want to risk losing all that nice loot you fought hard to get you're not going to touch that fanzy new gun that was added. And of course the cheaters...I don't feel like they have done ANYTHING to fix this MAJOR cheating problem i've gotten so fed up with it that it's tempting to start cheating myself cause it doesn't seem like anything is happening to those people cheating. Instead we get gun skins emotes air drop guns. Not a anti cheat system that works new maps a finished game. NO. All of that will come later after most of the player base are ing done with being killed by cheaters and hackers. I tell you do not waste your money on this game there are so many other great games to spend your money on. Instead of a half piece of battle royale game that feels the need to sue other develepors for making battle royale games even though they are all copying the same genre that has been out far longer then this piece of garbage. Spend your money on something else or better yet save that money.

The 1.0 version of PUBG is an absolutely pathetic showing from Bluehole. Blueballs Interior Design has no idea how to make a real game the studio is a joke and brings nothing but shame to their names. Every game session is marred by multiple bugs horrendous rubber banding for the first few minutes glitchy physics on players and vehicles non existent footsteps and ghost footsteps are now commonplace. Bullets pass right through enemies at range or get stopped by invisible rocks and other objects. Smokes are often invisible to one or more members of my squad. I'll throw three and see only two how often enemies mustn't see them. Practically every aspect of the game is buggy the vehicles cannot go up steep hills because the AI constantly shifts gears killing all speed.

Product received for free. The devs for this game do NOT test their updates as more and more bugs are introduced. The RNG is terrible and for the most part your chances are winning are GREATLY increased if the zone favors you. If you are caught running out in the open you're screwed. It's based 20% on skill/aim and 80% on luck/positioning. The new desert map is complete garbage and just ugly to look at. And then we get to the hackers... With a small amount of research they claim the game has sold over 3 million copies. 1.5 MILLION players have been banned already for hacking and the hacking is still rampant. They say that most of the hackers come from China and even if you play on North American servers there's a high chance to randomly group with Chinese players. Main problem with that is simply the language barrier. You need communication to strategize in a game like this which you can't do if your team mates do not speak English.,Not Recommended
The devs really do not care about the genral populace they refuse to listen to anything the community says about the game and generally do not focus on making the game good. Pubg Corp. really only cares about making the most money they can before they drop the game completely and that is very evident in the way they handle hackers and D sync.,Not Recommended

After playing it for about 200 hours or so... it's great in theory bad in practice. Mostly because of all the hackers and cheaters especially in third person. I get the sense that if the company (which if I recall correctly is based in South Korea) were to *actually* fix many of the problems (botting shooting through walls etc) China would slap them. Hard.They could fix this by either a region lock or by pairing all known cheaters into one group and all regular players into another so everyone gets the experience they want. For now pass it by especially for its current price. I only still play because there's really nothing better out there at the moment and Pubg beat others to the genre.,Not Recommended

"The game itself is good and in any other case I would recommend it but...I was falsely banned by the devs. Not one of those ""my brother was playing and he cheated I swear it wasn't me!"" or ""oops I left my mods for *other game* running!"" false bans but a straight up ""I logged on and was banned"" ban.Innocence is impossible to prove but I know what my situation is and nobody else does so if you happen to read this and think ""obviously you were cheating"" then you can stop here.However what really ticks me off about this false ban is the developer's refusal to cooperate. I have made support tickets on both their forum and their official helpdesk and in both cases my response was simply ""our evidence supports the initial ban claim it has been reviewed and the ban will stay"". What evidence? Supposedly they can't provide evidence as ""hackers can use it to their advantage"" I think the reality in my case is that there is no evidence.I have clearly been banned by some kind of false flag in their anticheat BattlEye as one look at my statistics or a typical game would show you that I'm not even that great at the game I highly doubt someone saw my behaviour and reported me. So this automated system assumedly has me banned and the support staff thoroughly believes that it can do no wrong. Great...There are tons of false ban reports out there on the Steam forums for this game on their official forums and in just about every reply to BattlEye on Twitter. I'm sure that while many of these are people who were in fact cheating the sheer numbers say to me that SOME of these people like me must surely have been innocent.Still the developers refuse to believe their bans can be mistaken so I'm missing the money I paid for this game and I have a nasty ""1 ban on record"" blemish on my account. It's probably there forever and the only people who can do anything about it vehemently refuse to do anything about it.So yeah I'm assuming that you don't want to be locked out of a game you paid for with no evidence or support so for that reason I can't recommend this game.",Not Recommended

Is there any anti cheat system at all? Not even talking about all the bugs and s***** optimization !! The game needs to work more on getting rid of those scumbag cheaters. You can never make a serious game. Only play for the lels (old)(NEW)Ok ... I've been like this for almost 2 months without seriously playing the game and everything changed !! This is the most unique game I've ever seen. Like I said I've been almost 2 months without any Pubg and this week I gave some of my time to this and ... AMAZING how human beings can be manipulated just because it's the game with the most players daily nowadays (cof cof Fortnite) it does not mean it's good.Game pains Going with friends in the finals and our vehicle explodes without even getting damaged or die for vehicle explosion without any vehicles around giving multiple shots in the head with Kar 98 into people with lvl 1 or 2 helmet and getting killed in the next second while using a lvl 3 helmet with one shot of mini 14 landing on the floor with the parachute and after 1 second lose almost half of the health or even more (die) try to play in a random squad and in every server there's full asian team (nothing against asian people but it's really anoying when you try to communicate with people and the only thing they do is screaming in some random asian language. Can you guys start using your asian servers) grenades take different times to explode character / parachute stuck in props lack of updates hte most ridicullous number of hackers at least in every game you find one optimization is the only thing wich is better but still bad killcam bugged sometimes worst hitbox... I could spend hours here...ADVICE If you are looking for a really unique game this one is a must buy. This game is the most unique game I ever played. There's no game as bad as this!

I love the games concept 100 man battle royal this game would have me playing hours and hours if it wasn't for the awful optimization of this game.I have literally seen things in toilets prettier than this games optimization. I love the fact that I have to play this game at low settings to be able to experience little to no lag. Whenever I get into a gun fight it always helps that my frame rate plumits to a single digit number. How's my PC you may ask? I can run triple A titles (Battlefield 1 COD WW2 or any highly graphical game) at ultra settings 1080p and keep about 70 80 FPS without dropping below 60. The textures loading in are probably the worst experience ever. Having textures loaded in is like gambling about half the games I play the textures aren't loaded in when I drop onto the map. The textures look worse than Playstation 1 graphics that were half and if they don't load in you have to sit outside and wait for the textures to load in and sometimes you really have to wait. Earlier when I was waiting for the textures to load in I was moving around hoping they'd load and I was experiencing FPS less than 5 and a bunch of freezing. Once the textures did decide to load in about 40 players were dead so in the time that I was waiting for my textures to load half the server got wiped.The game developers know how popular their game is and they probably know very well that this game has had optimization problems so instead of fixing it they make a deal with Microsoft to have it ported to Xbox One where the optimization is god awful. Playing on a normal Xbox One you're looking at a solid 30 fps or below guaranteed.Fix. Your. Game.,Not Recommended

Take it from someone who's played a lot of this game You don't want to play this game.It's buggy the devs won't fix issues that have been in the game since its inception and cheating is so rampant that it's likely you'll have 8 or 9 out of every 10 games ruined by it.The netcode is poor the client side hit detection is absolutely prone to infuriate even the most easygoing gamer and the servers are populated by people from all over the world so any given player's ping is bound to be arbitrarily high.The performance is shoddy at best it's massively processor intensive and the graphics won't look good unless you have a graphics card with a ridiculously high model number.When you have friends and can play a game with good coordination (or even not) and don't get beaten by the ever present cheaters the game is seriously fun.

"Overall the game is incredibly fun to play. The mechanics are quite simple that anyone can pick it up. Whether it's Solo's Duo's or Squad's the game still somehow keeps you ""hooked."" That's about all the good things I can say about the game. Now my problem with the game comes in a couple of ways one of them being CHEATERS. I've come across several instances where I get randomly killed from a player who is not even near me. For example one such experience occurred while playing Squad's with randoms. My whole team was in a building taking cover yet somehow everyone got killed through the walls from headshots. Since I was confused on how exactly I got murdered through the wall I ended up reviewing the replay. Apparently someone from who knows where shot at ""random"" through MOUNTAINS and through walls killing me and my whole squad. This infuriates me to no end. With this in mind one thing crucial to keep in mind is that these types of experiences always happen with people who are CHINESE. I understand the creator of this game has spoken of such issue but I'm sorry the creator isn't doing enough to fix the problem. I see many reviews here demanding a region lock for Chinese players and I'm sorry but I have to agree with them. I know it sounds incredibly harsh but I've had it. Another thing since a massive number of Chinese players are now flooding into the North American server it's almost impossible to find someone who speaks ENGLISH. Whenever I click on the NORTH AMERICAN server I expect players speaking ENGLISH. Seriously the server is named North American but almost no one speaks English. This probably sounds extremely petty but I can't enjoy Duo's or Squad's anymore since I cannot understand a single thing from my teammates. Overall I'm going to be supporting the REGION LOCK demand like many others. I know as I've said before it's harsh but I can't take it anymore.",Not Recommended

The frames I get on medium settings are good never dips below 60fps but I would expect as much out of a 6700k and a 1080ti.

The Game mechanics are BAF as well as the fact the you set weapons to burst/full auto and you're lucky if it doesn't just pop off one round then nothing. There are also some bad clipping issues with opponents being ablt to glitch their gun barrel through a window sill and bang you when they shouldn't be able to as well as issues with other players having lag because of their bad connection and getting rewarded with a kill when they sould have died from a close range headshot but because of their lag you get robbed then they turn and get free shots that don't register till you are already dead because of their connection. This game is not worth $30 maybe $15 at best considering the glitches that are very prevelent.,Not Recommended

Everyone punching each other and no one is dying so I assume we in some hangout and I hear alot of asians talking..I can't say japanese chinese korean or any of that cause I can't understand jack s# $. I immediatly said to myself...I made a mistake...I joined the wrong server! I can't communicate jack but it turns out this is a solo match so its cool. jumped out the plane go in some town...grab S# $ and fight...turns out no one is around so the silence got me all paranoid! All I got was a pistol from all dem towns so I decided to move onto the next....a few minutes later i see my map full red and I dont understand it until I saw explosions from afar coming at me and basically panicked and ran...to get the idea it was like this https //www.youtube.com/watch?v T7xJ Ngq5CUAfter survivng dat crazy S# %...I wondered to myself why there are soo many people fighting just for that chicken dinner and I thought to myself dat chicken dinner must be F #$ing finger licking good right? Maybe it doesn't have those 11 herbs and spices...IT MUST HAVE 22 HERBS AND SPICES! I'm dying to find out now...so I continued and found dis warehouse area and I saw a dude and decided to shoot him with mah pistol...the guy looks at me immediatley took shots at me but it missed...then just stared at me and I wondered why he stopped...I started shooting at him but it didnt hit him...I tried to figure out why...I then realize....im shooting behind a chainlink fence and it seems nothing is happening...I was like oh S# #....and ran the f #$ out....at the same time he started blasting at me and I took cover in some rocks.....someone else started shooting at him and I took advantage of dat and left. Took me a while to figure out how to heal myself with dem medkits and I noticed I got an energy drink so I drank it cause my characters gotta be hungry right? Anyways went into another house and I found some grenades and a crowbar and was like..OMG HALf LIFE! but I hear a motorcycle and someone coming in the same house I am in....I was like OH S #$...but I had a crowbar so I ran to him...but I saw dat goddamn assault rifle and panicked and ran back. The other guy started chasing me around the house while trying to figure out how to leave him...but I saw his motorcycle! so I took dat and drove off....he took some shots at me while leaving but HE GOT JACKED BUAHAHAH....anyways...I saw dis electrical coming at me and drove back and I notice it was coming at me fast....I then checked the map and realize the area gets smaller and smaller and those caught outside will get zapped! While I had my motorcycle I was driving off the road and it led me to a hill that made me jump out like a ramp and I hit a pole....then i got stuck to it and was like WTF?!....at least I lived though...WRONG it blew up! and thus ended my life. I will never try those 22 herbs and spices chicken dinner (.So how is this game?...it could be better I guess....I'm kinda high so good night everyone...have fun!",Not Recommended

Dear Bluehole.This was once one of my favourite games. It used to run decent on my late 2016 Gaming Laptop. And now? Really crappy performace even when I turn down the resolution and use minimal settings. Noone really asked for all that new crap. New maps new guns bla. It's all nice to have when you've got a game that performs good. We used to play with friends evening after evening. That stopped weeks ago. It may be time for you to do something in that direction. Over &amp Out...,Not Recommended
With over 400 hours on the game I feel people just starting should get a headsup 1.) SOOOOOOOOOOO many hackers. There are hacks out there right now being advertised that they are undetectable and only $25 and they work!! PUBG knows about this and they do not care. You can report someone for cheating but PUBG does NOTHING about it. 2.) Their nat code needs serious work. Theres no reason I should be shooting at someone who has level 1 gear.. hit them 6 times... they turn around and shoot me once while I have level 2 gear. Doesn't matter the gear their nat code is off. I have videos of me in level 3 gear and getting shot one time and dying after putting a clip into someone with level 1 gear.3.) The vehicle psychics are ridiculous. I've been with this game from the beginning and they have made NO effort to fix the vehicle system. Driving a bike is pretty much suicide as you can hit a pebble in the road and the bike goes flying and you die. They also have a ton of invisible walls around the map that vehicles run into and of course you take damage from. (i.e. like transitioning from grass to a road. ) 4.) They have made adjustments to AFKs however they have missed the most simpliest of fixes for afks.. Don't auto release the parachute. Releasing the parachute should be a manual thing. AFKs won't deploy their chutes and will die on impact. Also... who says I can't release my parachute late to get down first?? If I take a bit of damage who cares.. If i want to get down first and release the chute 50 feet from the ground I should be able to. Taking away the auto deploy of the parachute would solve all the afk problems. Such a simple fix.. missed by the devs. 5.) The server performances have improved however you make 500 million on your game before it's even released the FIRST thing you do is upgrade your hardware.. ANY IT company knows this! Yet they are continuously having server issues that is most liking caused by the overabundance of people playing. Simply upgrading your servers will improve the server performances drastically. (My bachelors in networking tells me this). It will also help with point 2 (the nat code).6.) The third person shooting is off. When holding the right mouse button to third person aim or just freely aiming the aim is off. You have to set the crosshairs to the left of the person in order to hit them. This is due to the POV in the game design. The cursors are off. Even when you have the cursors directly on someone you can see the bullets go through them and hit the wall behind them or whatever. Again this is the NAT code but the fact that the most basic thing for third person (aiming) is off is pretty sad. I appreciate the concept of the game. FPS players and TPS players have been waiting for a game like this for a while. They are so close to being the SERVICE they want however if you are trying to create a SERVICE the most important thing of that service is the CLIENTS you are presenting it to. If it's a piece of crap the clients won't appreciate it and watching the ratings for this game tank the last few months tell me they really need to rethink their gameplan and stop trying to run before you crawl (i.e. tournments NVIDIA intergrations new maps ). Fix the issues before you expand the game. You'll find you'll have more backers. I can't recommend this game at this time.,Not Recommended
OVERALL the gameplay is Decent guns feel good combat is mostly fun.EXCEPTThis game is rampant with cheaters. Majority are Chinese but a lot of Cheaters from other regions as well.This game NEEDS to region lock China AND have a better anticheat system. I run into cheaters every other game. Rarely is it aimlock but walling and no recoil. Cheating is a MAJOR problem. Overall If you want this style of game. And have fun with this style of game...

Well I bought this game because many of my internet friends said it's an awesome stuff. I absolutely get the hype and why it is so popular.However I dislike a few things. If you play on low settings then the game is going to look like it's from 2006. The textures becomes soo smudgy and I don't really feel I get 300+ FPS in return. Another thing is the movement. You can't climb/jump over things like a short fence. There is no climb animation yet they are still working on it. A lot of bugs...just get over it. The sound is weird too! Sometimes it's too loud but you can mute in game. I have a strange feeling that the developers don't know how to master the Unreal Engine.,Not Recommended

This was an amazing game when it launched. Now it is full of hacker 3/4 games we get killed thourgh rocks and other forms of Cover. I dont get how a game that made so much on launch cant keep up with the hackers it shows though. The Rating for this game used to be high now it is Mostly Negative. Get the Hint and DONT BUY THIS GAME. Its is a waste of your money. I wish i could get a refund since in my opionon they company Bluehole can not mantain the online servers nor do they release anything really on time. Heck in the last E3 conferacne they talked about and demoed zombie game play and stated it would be release in a month or two yet nothing now but poor code that has been hack. But this is a Korean Based company so you can not expect much from them hack look at the games they have launched. They where not and are not prepared to deal with a good FPS game. Best of luck and hope this rant helps you in some way. ),Not Recommended
The main reason is that Bluehole are being DISRESPECTFUL to their users who bought the game. Making tons of promises and either doing some 1 ultra small update in a month or doing nothing at all. After many days (even months!) and many many funds that Bluhole gained they are still can't improve their game to make it at lease PLAYABLE. Too much bugs NO optimization (i'ts laggy on Intel i7 5700 Nvidia 965 M with LOWEST graphics which is not so good even on ultra) connection problems shutdown problems VERY and VERY slow updating (i can't even feel it after few months of playing PUBG). They said they will release the game until the end of 2017 but i just can't imagine how they are goind to do this with SO MUCH problems that game still has. If they will still release it it won't be a full and released game anyways so +1 to disrespecting us. That's sad. However the game has a potential to become something big and impressive since the gameplay and emotions i got from it was perfect sometimes. I REALLY hope that Bluehole will start to work super hard and intensive to make PUBG a completed game. Until that happen i NOT RECOMMEND buying this game to anyone.,Not Recommended

After 120+ hours in this game I can say that it is a lot of fun. Especially with a friend or a full squad. This WOULD be the best Battle Royale. But there are very many game breaking issues that just really me and my friends off. PROS Skill Based Gunplay I love this a lot its not hitscan. Vehicles Big Map Cannot use .ini files to turn off grass and shadows as of the new update. Decent variety of guns and ammo Attachments and a lot of them Solos Duos and Squads Can turn off auto matchmakin if you have 3 people and don't want to be auto matched with another guy Can choose where to drop off at A very useful and good map and compass Markers/Waypoints Character runs pretty damn fast (Pro in my opinion) CONS t Tickrate I've died numerous times because of the t Tickrate it needs to be higher. Graphics are not that good especially for the performance you get. Needs more optimization Server lag needs to be fixed Some attachments are useless i.e. the 15x scope. It isn't variable and it is way too zoomed in to use. Needs more audio settings like footstep volume and car volume. Needs more Graphic Settings Overall this game is amazing and a lot of fun. But with the tickrate and the server lag it just infuriates me. These need to be fixed as soon as possible. I understand its been out for a few months but these issues are #1 right now.EDIT I love this game so much but after hearing the news about the crate + key system being implemented I'm kind of Player Unknown said that system wouldn't be implemented until the game was out of EA and was finished. Yet here they are. I've lost a lot of respect for Player Unknown. Its disguisting how cash cowish this is. This game is amazing and I will love it always. But this is very shady and disgusiting.,Not Recommended
Plagued with problems currently. Has massive potential but the developers are definitely not correctly using all the money they have made to fix the issues that are destroying the gameplay experience of the game. Terrible pathing and collision lag spikes terrible user interface total lack of a progression system terrible cheaters constantly ruining matches broken party system bad matchmaking poor balance of weapons and vehicles incorrect balance of vehicles on the map for the size and so many more issues right now. Really makes the game hard to enjoy but the overall concept and framework for a good game are there within it but more bad than good right now.Still feel the same in 2018. Constant updates literally every day and no major improvements so far. This game is a waste of time and money.,Not Recommended

First of all i want to say this game when it first came out had a lot of potential i had heaps of fun.But in considering how long it was in early access just shows how unfinished this game is from things like d sync to the game crashing fps lagg when in an intense gunfight and also when driving to get out of the blue zone the car or vehicle just randomly either blows up or flipsThis game is still not finished or playable at a gameplay standpoint its just really disappointing as its been out for almost 2 years or 2 + years idk but the point is What the devs thought was good New Crates etc New maps New Guns (like 5 new guns scopes and Attachments were added)What the Devs should have focused on D sync Fps lagg Region lock so it would keep the hackers out Optimize the game betterAll in all ive spent about 100+ hours on this game and its just so repetitive.AIM OF THE GAMESpawn in the middle of nowhere get a pistol get gunned down by someone corner camping with an ak47 this makes the game so bland and just boring nothing to level up towards maybe they should of added a progression system,Not Recommended
So i have played a little over 300 hours on this game not a heap but enough to have a decent opinion on the game. The problem with this game is the more you play the worse it gets. Not much point selecting a specific server when they're all full of chinese anyway. This game started off as a pretty well received game and even though it had lots of glitches in early access lots of them were fixed. However this game was rushed to a version 1.0 release and rushed to be released on console. The game is now full of hackers and laggy servers. The developers no longer care about actual gameplay and instead release 6 gig updates entirely based on cosmetics and tiny bug fixes. This game is currently a horribly optimized mess and i would avoid buying it.If your looking for a battle royale game i would suggest playing either Islands of nyne or Escape from Tarkov they are well balanced have dedicated spray patterns and can easily maintain a stable framerate they also constantly receive new content from the developer and bug fixes as well as not being plagued by hackers.Edit 1 Wow what do you know i'm still playing this heap of game i've played another 250 hours since i wrote this review and if i'm being completely honest the game has not improved. The physics engine in this game is so broken you can literally drive over a bump at 10 km/h and end up doing 4 backflips and blowing up. And the game run so badly still how has this not been fixed?I mean how do you even manage to lower the optimisation of the game with every update? Also who thought the event pass was a good idea???

"It is disheartening and upsetting to play this game in its current state. The feeling of growing pure hatred for chinese players due to their freedom of selfishly running hacks to ruin games. The blatant lack of self respect they show by using the cheapest and easiest means possible to win is a sad thing to see. It would be nice to play a game of PUBG without being instant headshot from hip fire at 300m after reaching top 5. There is a serious problem that needs serious attention. While the majority of the community holds the stance of ""git gud"" and prefers to ignore the problem. I believe that there needs to be change. The worst part is the direct racism that is being manifested by the community. I like to believe that I love the Chinese and their culture but this game has shown me their true form. I now can only refer to them as s and cheaters. I hope there will be something done about this issue. The stats are there to support the problem.

The game was fun at the beggining like most hits but success got to the development team's head and PlayerUnknown himself thinks he hasnt done anything. The gamerelies mainly on luck no skill whatsoever. You can lan on a building which you think is oaded with gear yet you only find clothing or melee weapons if youre lucky. Jump house to house with only your crowbar and then surprise you get a face full fo lead cuse there was no weapon to be found.Now they adding payed keys to unlock crates the only reason you would like to jump right back in to this games was because of he BP system in which you earn points to by loot crates. But now the take that away and leave you with a bland game hat provides no pleassure no rewarding experience for winning no progression no nothing. KotK feels better in that sense cause you have somewhat of a reward and recognition for how you played the game.

TL DR Game is poorly optimised buggy and the developers care more about making money than fixing them.Despite the global success of this game the developers have decided to on the community and divert time and resources into implementing paid cosmetic features rather than fixing game breaking bugs and issues. I have a decent spec system and this game is an absolute resource . It crashes all the time and even when I can play the game has serious frame drops. Sometimes it will freeze for up to a couple of seconds which obviously leads to deaths in firefights. Game concept is good but if you want my advice wait for one of the big players to come into the battle royale market and buy a finished product don't assist this company and their terrible business model with your hard earned bucks.,Not Recommended
Game is fun but I have questions about the Devs motives and what he plans to do with this game. I have a fear that we were sold a 40 dollar free to play game with a crate system shoehorned in for the dev to make extra cash and has put as a priority before game stability with them only testing on the server for one day. I cannot recommend this game so much is subject to change and microtransactions have already slipped into it while it is incomplete.Some of the recent updates have ruined the flow of the game drag and dropping gear is now slowed and nearly ed the pace of the game this was clearly done because certain players just couldn't keep up and it restricts fast players.UPDATE I was right this game was a cash grab don't buy this garbage after microsoft purchased rights to the game they rushed a console port out and stopped giving a single about making the game stable.

The game has changed alot over my 1000 hours from updates being released everyweek and monthly weapon releases to getting one update a month. I know there is alot that goes into making and keeping a game together. I have a love/hate relationship with this game at this point... The market place ( I believe ) ruined the game!!!

REGION LOCK!!!! every game that is in ""Esports"" has some kinda for region lock for ping/game preformence! idk I think this game could of been one of the best Multiplayer games of all time but due to the current issues that havent been address there will be other BR games to come and will do what PUBG hasnt and will overthrow them!",Not Recommended

I have +400 Hours playtime on my main account before pubg started to lock family share.This is an awesome game i actually play it every day with my friends or random people but to be honest where i live there are no servers with the ping under 150 200 ms to play so the thing i should do is actually go to EU/NA servers which are even more laggy.this player's hit box is terrible and you can get shot when Ur even behind a tree and if your ping is above 100 150 and you shoot only half of your bullets goes out of Ur gun and the rest hit the ground when ur dead!the point is Blue hole can let us host our own PUBG servers so everyone in out country or neighbor countries can have a better experience of the game...and about hackers... i actually got killed the day after anti cheat release by a HACKER.,Not Recommended

ONE OF THE WORST CHEATER PROTECTIONS ON A GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN. Battle eye could not be any worst the hit registration is garbage and the server problems are unexceptable. For a gamer to make so much money and not give back decent patches or listen to the people playing the game is a outrage. i dont kmow what bluehole thinks a good game is but if they think pubg is good then they need a career change. The game was a hit a is fast going down hill if they would listen to the people and fix their problems they could have a AAA game easily but as it stands the game is overran by hackers and cheaters alike.,Not Recommended

When i first started playing PUBG it was full of glitches and bugs many have been fixed some are still there but the Dev intead of fixing everything to make the game much more smooth and less power hungry they choose to add new content and mask the things the make the game almost unplayable for many people the game is horribly optimized...It was getting better i was giving it time since it was a Beta but now comes out version 1.0 and... Same still there PLUS now the game and all servers are plagged with chinese hackers theres not a game that i dont encounter one or 5 10 20!!! It got the a point where i see no pleasure of gaming anymore you spend your free time playing a game that gets ruinned by a freaking chinese hacker!!! And what are the Devs doing about it? NOTHING because the amount of money the chinese gamers bring is way more than the rest of us so in a way is good for them to have the hackers they ban them they buy a new game hack again gets banned and the cycle continues...So for now i don't recomend the game its a lot of fun but for now it will just you off!!!,Not Recommended
"Ah Player Unkown's BattleGrounds by BlueholeAlright you're browsing for a new ""Hot Intense Multiplayer Shooter"" and you hear talk (if you haven't already) about this game. PUBG one of if not the only game to beat DOTA2 on steam charts with a top of 3m players on steam. You buy it for that gut wrenching expensive price of $30 USD just to get well complete garbage optimization bugs toxicity that tops off of CSGO cheaters foreign language spam microtransactions for skins that may or may not provide an advantage and just the entire people's republic of china dominating over US servers with hackers obliterating server ping and making your ears bleed. Was fun but it's not worth the price to play some complete garbage game that has a developer having the need to brand his stupid ing name on the title of the game. This isn't fun. And with all the other great BR including games such as their massive competitor Fortnite which released a FREE br gamemode i'm glad this piece of hot trash is getting mixed reviews and becoming one of the worst ing games of 2017.

At the state it is in right now and the direction it looks like it's going in with the garbage developers who have no idea how to respond to a community I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. This game just makes players rage and you get shot around walls every game there's too many chinese on the NA severs that ruin the game with their hacks you can't pick your own map the devs are literally and Greene the top guy at PUBG Corp called their entire fanbase xenophobes and need to ""calm the down."" It's just sad that this game has to be devved by such and a owner. I can't wait for AAA title to destroy this trash game even if it's EA honestly at least I'll get good gameplay.",Not Recommended
"I really want to love this game man. It does the ""Battle Royale"" formula better than any of it's competition BUT.......CONS... Let me first start by saying the servers for this game are AWFUL. Considering the scale of the game the servers should be powerful enough to handle it right??? No... they run like dog with people lagging all over the place especially during the most important part of the game.. The intial drop. as soon as you get your boots on the ground enter a building and try to pick up a weapon you find yourself SPAMMING F to pick up whatever is in front of you. In addition to having horrible starting combat which consists of whoever has the ier internet wins the fight because on his screen you aren't behind the cover that you were running for. The loot is so horribly random sometimes you find yourself frustrated because you loot an entire building and walk out with a flashbang and the guy next door has a M16 with a 4X and armor. (I'm not complaining too much about this but I find myself to always be the unlucky one) Optimize your game I can't believe that they had a tournament for this game in the state that it's in. Sometimes you will load in and your buildings will look like PS1 Graphics and other times your buildings won't even load in and then you will get stuck in a wall. (ps I don't have a bad PC either i7 and a 1080) So I can't even try to comprehend how someone with a bad PC could play this game and the Xbox version of this game is just a ing joke lol. Being able to pick the server you want to play seems like a good idea on paper but in reality it is the worst idea ever. Like I said before the higher the ping the more advantage you have. Chinese players are just running around North American servers Cheese their way around with their high ping. I can't even tell you how many times I've been killed by players with names like Xhang Ping4354325 or Rihg yao fsade3. Miramar aka the desert map is the best/worst thing to come to the game. The map design is amazing compared to the OG map But everytime I ready up and I pop into the new map I want to leave. It is TOO big for 100 players there are too many points of interest so most of the time you end up maybe getting into a fight midway endgame which makes the matches so long drawn out and boring. Gun balance is a weird topic when it comes to this game because everything seems to be balanced but when you think of it what guns are you drawn to as a player. Most people would say the Kar98k or the M416. This is because these are the safer options unlike the AK or the SKS which boths recoil are just unusable in my opinion. Which leads me to come to the conclusion that some guns need some work to make them more well rounded like the M4 Mini14 and the M16.Pros.. You will never have your heart race in any other game like this game. Gun customization is ok Vehicles are fun.. sometimes Long Distance Combat Uninstall Button works after almost 500 hours!F%&amp # this game let's be real boys",Not Recommended

They Ruined my favorite game. Desert map is terrible. Game looks fuzzy and has weird shadows. 1.0 is garbage. The game has been going downhill ever since the patch that added the Groza. Vehicles are death traps slide all over the terrain and blow up randomly. Everything that has been implemented into this game reduces the skillful aspect of the game. Crouch jumping was something a player had to master to take advantage of now you can just vault (and randomly die at times to a vaulting glitch). Bullet drag makes it impossible to hit shots at +300m consistently especially on moving targets. The desert map is way too big in cities there are thousands of angles you can get shot from and the mid game on the desert map is a boring and involves running 1000's of meters to get to the zone. I have a lot of hours into this game and thoroughly enjoyed most of the early access. I am an above average player who has 200+ chicken dinners and know what I am doing (https //pubgtracker.com/profile/pc/LucaEats?region agg). After this 1.0 update I will not be playing this game any longer unless changes are made. Uninstalled,Not Recommended
BAD OPTIMIZATION just soooooo bad you can't run this game in any computer.They just care about money if you think they will optimize the game on the next updates you're totally wrong.The new missions it's a good idea sadly it's a copy from Fortnite Season Pass.

And of course like every thing in these game it's wrong missions are not working some missions have rewards some other not you can keep dreaming... maybe on year 2220 they repare all the code.,Not Recommended

I've been addicted to this game since the early weeks. After about 731 hrs of mixed feelings reaching from blind anger to utter joy I can't accept the way the developers walk right now.I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GAME!I had a lot of fun with my friends. About 35 to 40 people in my friendlist also played PUBG!But Instead of fixing bugs optimizing the game banning hackers rightfully (not the casual players) and making the game actually enjoyable they introduce more payed crates a premium pass they ban people randomly and don't even think about listening to the community. Even worse They sue Fortnite a game that doesn't suit me but does everything so much better than PUBG just because they overcame them in player number. You would guess.I will not play until they stop being such a cash cow. The way they milk this game is disgusting.!!!DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!,Not Recommended

Even though this game had such a massive success ever since it was released the devs were more interested in making the game look nice by adding more customization rather than actually making it playable. With every update the game becomes less playable and some bugs that used to be fixed are back in the game and Chinese players make playing with randoms impossible. I want to like this game because I ve spent way too much time playing it and I want to continue playing it but with every update it becomes more obvious that the devs are only after profit rather than making the game actually enjoyable. If you plaN on buying the game I strongly reccommend you to watch videos of the game in its current state rather than how the game used to be a few months ago. I don t reccommend anyone to buy this game because even though the game is officially released now it s less finished than ever.,Not Recommended

Dont waste your money until they fix the hacking issue. I could care less how many maps you make adding vehicles/guns adjusting stats. None of that matters until you get rid of the hackers. It's getting very frustrating when you get killed by a guy with no recoil every single game spamming you full auto at 200 meters with an AK. Another issue is they have still refused to ping lock the game. You are on a North American server but get paired with asain teammates who you either cant talk to or they kill you to take your items. Final Verdict save your money unless you also want to buy hacks to compete with every other one out there.,Not Recommended
"All my friends were raving about PUBG before it came out and I was skeptical but I ended up buying it anyway. While the servers were quite buggy and a lot of crash gameplay issues the game was super fun like no game Ive played in a long time. That was a year ago. All thats changed since beta till the full release is 2 maps about 7 more guns and 12 gun attachments. The game is STILL cluttered with so many bugs and gameplay issues. More and More battle royals are coming out and are way more optimized then PUBG even by smaller developers. Despite PUBG selling 50million copies the developer said ""there are problems you cant just throw money at and make it go away"".... Thats kinda how the world works. I have fallen out of love with this game about a month or 2 after 1.00 release.",Not Recommended
Recently gave it a shot.After waiting nearly a year since the release for bug fixes and optimization.Just to find out that it's still B R O K E N.I can't seem to go 2 games without getting random bugs and glitches.Throw in a hacker here and there and this game is unplayable.Don't buy it waste of money.You're better off playing Fortnite with 12 year old kids.,Not Recommended
This will more than likely update as the game updates and fixes issues.PUBG pretty much right now is a glitch fest. The shots are no where near accurate compaired to other third person and First Person games such as ARMA 2 and 3 and quite frankly is very unoptimized for older graphics cards (900 series for Nvidia). What I do like about this game is the fact that there are guns similiar to the real world counter part. The problem that I see with this game as of right now is that there are too much issues with hit registration and if you lag you are pretty much winning from the get go. My advice to people who are wanting to go with a battle royal game go with the one that has been out more which is H1Z1 rather than this one. Again once this game gets fully released (if ever) I will update it as it probably has more bug fixes and tweaks. Public Release Review Not much has changed with this game. Hit Registration is poor and if you don't have internet speeds about the national average in the US expect to die A LOT. Net coding is still garbage and instead of adding new features maybe they the developers should focus on improving their engine instead of this. Don't get me wrong the new map is beautiful and fun but they should have focused on Long Term Support rather than adding new features and making sure that this game was good enough for it to be publicly released. I find that as a consumer that people want to follow trends but like I stated above go with the people who started it first which was ARMA 3 mods and H1Z1. Mini Royal Review Again same issues still horrible net coding and hit regs are still garbage and hackers are still more prevalent than ever instead of fixing the issues BlueHole decided to release DLC and decided to not to fix the unoptimized garbage of a game. No wonder Fortnite Battle Royal is become more popular than this. They actually take time to fix their coding and seeing what the players want. Avoid this game like the Plauge also they are still banning people for something that they did not do.,Not Recommended

I bought this in early access when it was a buggy mess. Now its a fully released buggy mess where you see how long you can survive before a cheater headshots you to death from a mile away by firing a fully automatic weapon with no recoil at your head.Despite the issues it has I used to have fun before every single game had cheaters in it.At least wait until they deal with the cheating problem before you buy.

Product received for free. I found this game very enjoyable for the very short amount of time that I was able to play.

Cannot recommend to others until something is done about the cheaters. They are actively banning accounts but it is not enough. Need some server detection instead of client side hit detection as most games are now filled with somebody hipfiring a fully automatic weapon no recoil auto headshotting from behind two walls. Game has become unplayable due to the amount of hackers and even if you have a good game the final people you go up against will most likely be hackers and you will have no chance.,Not Recommended
Great game with great promise however the devs are destroying the game.

"I'm going to have to be honest here I don't know why this game is so popular still.If there were just a few things different about this game it'd be worth voting up and recommending to your friends.But it's not.Starting with the gameplay There's only a select few shooter games that utilize realistic ballstics (Arma Battlefield and this game are the only ones I can think of save maybe the Sniper Elite series but that's a debateable topic). This would be cool if your bullets ever registered properly.The servers run on average at about 17Hz. In simpler terms that means the server ""refreshes"" 17 times every second to register changes in the game shots impacts movements items collected etc. To put that into perspective most FPS games run between 30 60 CS GO (I believe) runs at 64Hz League of Legends at 30. This isn't even going into the beginning of the match where the high player density forces the servers to deteriorate to an 8Hz refresh rate abysmal by any stretch of the imagination. (Battle(non)sense did a video over this showing the details of this game compared to Fortnite which uses the same game engine and both use Amazon server hosting https //www.youtube.com/watch?v SwZ_NUruGTM).All this translates to Absolutely despicable ""rubberbanding"" that is at times so unbearable it's not even worth playing (http //www.ign.com/videos/2017/12/20/playerunknowns battlegrounds rubber banding is still the biggest problem with pubg on pc skip to about 40 seconds but I'm sure you've seen/heard countless other examples even worse than this one) Shots that were so obviously direct hits not registering being shot when completely behind cover shooting people square in the face with a shotgun yet they live sometimes not even taking a shred of damage (https //www.youtube.com/watch?v XqwhekZdBP4 https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 1KWw8I8dp6M &lt that one is a definitive example) Having to click items/doors multiple times before it registers you picked the item up/opened the door causing you to hover in one position just trying to get a garbage pistol or shotgun (that won't even register the hit) before someone comes up and jumps up and 1 shots you with their fist (logic!)The graphics have been improved tremendously since early access. This game was notoriously unoptimized pushing even the highest tiered systems to their limits on low graphics. Now you'll receive proper performance for your system (graphics wise gameplay wise you're f****ed bud) and running it at a constant 60fps shouldn't be an issue for any mid tier gaming rig.The audio is perhaps not as bad as it could be with long range shots actually sounding long range (you'll see/hear the bullet land on you/near you before you hear the shot itself) and suppressors being semi realistic in that they don't turn your weapon into a subsonic noiseless death machine that can barely be heard from 15 feet away. The biggest issue lies in footsteps because if there are people running around you outside the building you're in or above/below you in the same building you will have NO IDEA where they are because the sounds are just... whack. Even using a surround sound headset will barely help.Yet that is almost an unnoticeable issue when you consider just how atrocious the hit registration and lag issues are with this game.I have held off in throwing stones at this game for the longest time as I knew it was still in early access and likely had a very long way to go. We're now almost a year into development and somehow the gameplay has become worse. At first you will utterly fall in love with this game constantly clicking the play button again even though you knew that your last death was total rubbish. You will happily loot 3 cities and get all the best loot just to get in a 15 second long sniper battle and lose it all just to dust it off and play again. But this game will slowly begin to take its toll on your patience like dealing with a bad partner in a relationship you'll rationalize the negatives focus solely on the unquestionable positives and pretend like there's nothing wrong.Well there's a lot wrong. In the current state of the game it's not worth purchasing. There are a lot of much better more satisfying games that you could spend $30 on. Maybe in a few months when (if) they sort the game breaking issues out and provide steady server tickrates (at a rate higher than the painful 17Hz average) then purchasing it could be worthwhile. Until then Bluehole (PUBG Corp whatever the hell they want to call themselves) have a long LONG way to go still.",Not Recommended

This game is one of the smoothest I've ever played (after the horrifying drop + 2 minutes after the landing) and it's got some nice mechanics other than the shooting accuracy and damage mechanics but what makes this game so incredibly unplayable is a mix of the playerbase and how the game caters to complete bi and pu . There is not a single reason to play the game like a normal fps or battle royal and I don't mean that in that the game has a special niche gameplay. I mean it has the absolute worst gameplay you'd ever find. There have been times where I will drop with a guy and he will find himself in a safe spot where I have to push him and he will not move for 20 minutes until he is just about to die to the circle. What kind of gameplay is that? And don't get me started on fighting from tree to tree it is the worst experience anyone could ever have just dull boring encounters where every single opposing player is a complete bi . Everyone who tries to play the game normally dies within the first 5 minutes so you'll never find anyone with any resemblance of balls within the last 70 players alive. If steam does refunds someone show me how to get one.,Not Recommended

First off I have spent over 175 hours on this game so I have had my share of fun on this game. That being said I have realized that the biggest reason I played this game for so long was more due to me playing on co op than it is because of the quality of the game. PUBG is a running simulator and anyone who has played it can't deny it. The maps are too big the optimization is terrible especially for a company that has grown to this size and the gameplay becomes very boring and repetitive over time. I'll have to see if my opinion changes after the new map comes out with it's smaller size but I can't recommend the game in it's current state with the size of the first two maps.,Not Recommended

As an avid player of hardcore survival shooters I have logged a lot of hours in this staple battle royal game. The gameplay is challenging and the amount of shootout scenarios one might find themselves in is pretty much endless. However I am not recomending this game due to the amount of rage inducing cheating that occurs in the online matches. Please fix it bluehole Im sick of reporting cheaters without any indication that the problem is being resolved.,Not Recommended
I myself love this game don't get me wrong but when the developers can't even bother to fix sliding bugs that instantly kill you or manage to get a game such as this servers with more than 20 ticks i can not possibly say to someone oh this game is great go get it and enjoy the full experience,Not Recommended

"REGION LOCK IS NECESSARY!This game has a great concept and when not saturated with Cheaters has solid execution.After the 1.0 release the CEO took a firm stance against region locking. This has caused 75% of games to end in a hacker killing you across map.You know it's bad when everytime you see an oriental user name get a headshot or 2 in the kill feed you instantly sigh and say ""I'm going to die to a cheater.""I would not recommend this game to anyone it's littered with cheaters a VAST majority being from China. The CEO cares more about gaining $100 instead of $75 (crude example but Region locking would hurt the wallet I'm sure a little but wouldn't kill the game) than it's user base. Resolving the cheating situation is hard and unrealistic but region locking is logical and is instead called ""Xenophobic.""Do yourself a favor wait until Region locking comes out play Fortnite H1Z1 or another Battle Royale game.I am disappointed in the company and wish I hadn't played enough hours to not get a refund myself.I've recruited a dozen+ friends to this game and I am embarrassed now that they have spent money on this game to repeatedly die to cheaters. Avoid this game do not waste your time.",Not Recommended

Keep adding microtransactions instead of fixing game and go out and say theyre ""investigating"" server connection problems.

Sad to see a potentially good game get ruined by greed. PGI is a waste of time and yet another money making scheme from Bluehole and Tencent two very garbage companies who make MOBILE games.

"There will be a barrage of negative reviews posted for some time not entirely related to the game itself but rather of the politics behind the scenes. This post will be one of them.PROS So let's cut to the chase here the game is fun. It's one of the ""survival""/royale early access done right. The devs are churning out content by a lot. Lots has been promised many of which has been fulfilled. No reason to think they won't go to the moon.CONS So I'll divide this into two parts. the game play and the politics. First the gameplay.GAMEPLAY CONS Game is highly unoptimized. If you have anything older than current gen hardware expect to lag every game. There are no ""recommended"" currently because they are still figuring out optimizations but don't hold your breath for something grand.You need a fast harddrive or even SSD to run the game. Loading of the in game environment is highly dependent on the speed of the HDD so if you don't have a fast one expect your buildings not to load. This is majorily game breaking and is the difference between life and death as you struggle to pick up loot.Car physics are awful but doable. Expect to be thrown into the moon if you drive over a small crevice. POLITICS CONS Devs promised there not be microtransactions and it was found out the game will have microtransactions soon. They claim it's for their tournaments but tournaments for an early access game is a poor allocation of resources. Even if it wasn't they still broke their promise.So Playerunknown (PU) is the lead dev behind the game. PU is a massive abuser of his power. He has banned people from twitter and discord for having people disagree with him. He has banned players without evidence or due process. PU has also been in bed with the small streaming community carrying out their ban wish list on ""stream snipers"" without any evidence.",Not Recommended

Great game especially fun when playing with squad. However the hacking is ruining this game little by little and so far it seems the developers can not find a good way to stop these hackers. I will not recommend this game to anyone unless the developer could somehow find a way to eliminate these hacks.The hacking is particularly harzadous to this game compare to other shooting games. the player experience is extremely fratrusting if your squad did everything right and survived for 20 mins and then killed by a single hacker in few seconds all by headshot. I will just list a few hacking method that I have seen so far in the game 1. AimBot 2. Display all player's position3. running faster than Usain Bolt4. punching you from 20 yards away while you have no clue where you got hit at. 5. never die no matter how hard got hitand etc.Just avoid this game until hacking issue is resolved.,Not Recommended
1.0 was a huge step up the gameplay has improved even more from the amazing early access stage.Still gets a negative review from me unfortunately same reasoning as my earlier review. Cheaters are ruining what is currently the best game I've seen released from 1st or 3rd person shooters ever. 1.5 million cheaters banned and still you find a cheater (duo or squad) or a team (solo) every 2nd game. Some simple solutions 1. Create servers with no battle points. Stop cheaters farming crates. Make crates random drops on these servers at a 1/50 rate for any player who spawns into the game but completely seperate from the position you come or kills ratio. 2. Hire more people to deal with banning. 1.5 million x $30 $45 million you've raked in from cheating bans. That is a hole lot of high school students who could check for cheaters on minimum wage. 3. Region lock. I play in oceania. Not many NZ Aussie or polynesian players. Enough said. 4. Use in game death cam footage to check hackers (still being asked to send videos to prove cheating and teaming when clearly this info is hosted on your servers somewhere). 5. Consider banning IP addresses rather than steam accounts. This is pretty extremem but perhaps will make a difference.,Not Recommended

EDIT2 can i not get oneshot in the leg with a crosbow every game?EDIT3 can this game not be terribly optimized to a point where battlefield one on ultra and call of duty world at war can both get over 260 frames and at lowest 130 during heavy action while this game hapily gets 160 at the loading screen then when i load in i get a measly 10 40 even though most if not all of my settings have been turned down to potato and my resolution was changes as well?EDIT4 why is everyone so accurate? like a guy with a m4 on a hill is like full auto spraying and hits me for like 90 percent of the shots while im in a window like barely peekig and just every shot hits.Pros you can be dumb. drive cars.use medical supplies.Cons be wearing level 3 helmet and armor get onshot by a crossbow to the leg. be wearing level three helmet and armor get oneshot by an ump. have a 4 man squad with a mix of level 2 and 3 armor get decimated by one guy with crossbow who oneshots us all while i confirmed i had shot him 4 times in the head with sks along with the pepper spray of bullets from my allies. audio randomly switches side(confirmed this game only) and will trick your ears into thinking a guy is to your right front when he is actually behind you about to play with your dead body that is not so dead untill you turn around and spray a full clip at them and realize 7 shots to the chest from a scar l does nothing to someone else wearing level 1 armor. Multiple hackers met multiple times over a weak even after reporting found one who i reported 3 times before over the course of three weeks. land with someone and find a machete a level one vest multiple weapon attachements in a 4 building cluster while enemy seems to have looted a smaller and only one building just a few yards off and have level 3 armor helmet M16 SKS with tons of attatchments that should not be possible from one building alone. end up hating life because you got 8 kills and make it to the last 3 but some seems to have x ray vision and can see where you are in a bundle of bushes and heashot you even though i was 9000000000000% sure even superman would have not seen you. people with ungodly aim with a shotgun probably better than shroud and oneshot you with a shotgun across a field far out of the guns logical range even with a choke while he seems to have taken two grenades and 2 shots from an ak with no problem. this list can go on and on but im a salty boi who sucks at anything that is not using my right hand professionally.,Not Recommended
This is the best example of a great game that is in the hands of incompetant developers who don't know what theyre doing. They have the framework down but are completely incapable of doing anything incorrectly and brendan greene needs to be deposed for the company to be able to progress and the focus on lootboxes needs to go away until the game is actually playable.The right Shooting Mechanics Map design is good The wrong Chinese hackers infest this game well over 1million players just from china have been banned but brendan green will tell you youre xenophobic for wanting a region lock Circle circle at least in my experience is always always always going to ruin the game its always going to choose the complete other side of the map from me then continue to make me run as far as possible to get to every circle so i cannot engage anyone just stuck running which would be fine ish if i could outrun it ive lost far too many games because of a straight circle f#*$ing rather than me getting shot or dying like what is normal Red Zones are idiotic and need to go away right now Game Breaking bugs staying the the game for months such as a bug that can render your gun unable to shoot if you switch the firing mode too quickly after ads/picking up Servers are terrible crashing daily and tons of problems registering hits Loot tables only a handful of areas are even kind of worth it to drop if you have any hope of winning Vehicles weight distribution is awful especially on motorcycles youll just randomly bob back and forth and weave without ever touching a button Did i mention chinese cheaters?

"Here's all I've got to say 1. I originally bought the game because it promised good mod support they turned their backs on that promise.2. Brendan Greene Lead Dev claims that all custom servers will require a fee to run stating that it's how he had to run his mods back in his Arma 3 days Let alone that this game doesn't even allow real mod support Arma 3 lets you run servers on your own hardware you only paid to rent other people's servers. PUBG gives no choice but to rent a server.3. A heftily priced game which offers essentially one real mode Yet has the audacity to charge for cosmetics have made free means of gaining cosmetics absolutely insignificant and now also charges for a sort of Season Pass which is blatantly derivative off that of Fortnite's yet offers SIGNIFICANTLY less. Furthermore Fortnite has a free version of their BattlePass which offers nearly as much as PUBG's. How bout that?4. Game still runs like 5. To continue from point 3 The publishers have the audacity to attempt to sue other games for ""copying"" the Battle Royale mode even though Game Modes should never be liable to copyright Yet this PUBG mimics so many of the other Royale modes As mentioned with Fortnite's Battle Pass Emotes the new spotting functionality etc.6. And to continue from Point 5 the developers and publisher have so much audacity as if it forgets that the game is virtually asset flip one. It doesn't hide the fact that many of its 3D models were bought from the Unreal Engine store It makes you wonder how much more of the game was outsourced.7. The devs like to parade around how many hackers they've banned and the effort they put into keeping the game hacker clean yet it's mortifying how much this game is STILL plagued by hacking. Fanboys will parrot how ""it's not that frequent"" Hackers being noticeable in the first place is insufferable I've yet to encounter a hacker in Fortnite and so many other shooters I used to play. But most importantly you will have your game ruined by some hacker every 6 games. You can still argue that ""it's not a lot"" relatively but it still ruins your day with the game.8. The game is infested with bugs like the pantry of a run down restaurant in Eastern Belarus. Seriously more often than not the game handicaps you being of some bug.People that defend this game religiously will claim I'm so Fortnite fanboy like I've seen so many times before I've played my far share of Fortnite I have about 40 hours in it compared to my 270h here and I have to say I used to prefer PUBG. I found it a lot more enjoyable. But whilst I play neither now I can only say Fortnite is an objectively better game and it does it for free. You know what look beyond Fortnite go to Realms Royale go to the Darwin Project Go to The Culling even go to Ring Of Elysium! Because those games have polish and real originality that PUBG severely lacks.

This game has a lot of potential and isn't half bad but that wasn't really the issue for me. The biggest issue for me was how much the game needed in order to run properly with good frames and how slow they were pushing updates when I played. I haven't touched the game in 2 months and it may have changed since but since I have tried fortnite it has been hard to come back and this is due to how fast they come out with new updates that change the game. Giving me the feeling that they actually want to be succesful with this game by not stopping at a point because they are content with there income(Thats what it felt like when playing pubg). Pubg was bringing in players rapidly which also meant a huge income and when I see that a free to play is more into their community than a pay to play it makes me not want to play due to the lack of new cool features and fixes on bugs that would drive me crazy. Once again I have not touched the game in 2 months this is just a post that I failed to do earlier and I have no idea if they have changed there mindset since but based off the look of the recent ratings I would say they haven't.,Not Recommended
I want to like this game but I just cant. I havent been playing this game a whole lot but by watching videos reading news about the game and playing it myself I think Its best if you leave this game alone. PUBG could be a good game but the devs are focusing way much more on their mobile version of PUBG (which no one asked for) and then there also focusing their Xbox version way much more than the PC version. Then PUBG corp is trying to make a sport out of this game a unfinished game! PUBG has many bugs and glitches and then not to mention the unplayable lag at times. Plus the devs are extrememly I mean over the top EA level greedy. Their stupid battle pass didint even allow players to keep the free items instead you have to pay for the battle pass to actually keep the free items or else there was a time limit on those items and you'll eventually lose them then to top it all off they want you to pay 2 dollars for a damn key to open one of their crates almost every crate needs a key and some of the clothing in those crates are 0000.1% chance to get them how do I know this? simple. I watched a youtube called TheActMan explaining how this game basically steals your money and dosent give you anything back. Look I want to like this game and it has great potential to be a decent battle royal game but sadly the devs are slowly killing their game just like the h1z1 devs did.

How do you make the worst most popular game on steam? Simple you have a company like blue hole make it. While the core gameplay loop is fun and very interesting the game it self is a hot mess. From making a server transition from AWS to Azure during a massive and major update period. To having FOV rendering based on the client side and not server side. To running the worst possible tick rate on a server you can think of all the way to implementing features without fixing core elements. This game has in all in the list of do not's in a shooter. I know this review is nothing and it will mean nothing. But I feel it's important to stress how utterly bad this game is. If you some how have magically not bought this game yet by now please do yourself a favor and avoid it at all costs. The dev team for this game haven't the slightnest clue what they are doing. The performance is better than it was at launch but it's still awful. The game is runnign on a 32 bit client for who knows what reason. Screen tearing and out of no where fps drops are still common and unexpected. Hit detection is unthinkably bad for a game this popular. The number of times i have seen or watched bulllets fly through someones face into a wall and do nothing is insane. The phyisics in the game are still completely broken often fiding things like cars spiraling out of control and flying off into the sky is still common. Things like server delay on those actions means you can fall down a cliff for 5 feet take half your health in damage. Only to be killed by a person who jumps off a flying motorcycle and falls two stories kill you. Avoid this game until someone else can fix it's issues.,Not Recommended

This game was fun at first but seeing as its based of the unreal engine its hacked on release of beta and has far too many in game interactions that just feel horrible.I wont talk about the bans for the streamers this game is in bed with but I will cover a few gameplay flaws here.ADS is a joke while trying to take cover and shoot from walls or elevated positions as you are alway firing from your hip it seems and have to back up the distance equal to the height of the wall so you arent just chewing up a rock or window seal. this is because the game is a 3rd person shooter and feels very clucky in the FPS mode. Vehicle control and iteraction is just a joke. Seeing who is landing near your jump zone is impossible to determine because some players are just stright up invisible so you have no time to adjust your play. Jumping and clearing small obsticles is laughable at best so the basic fundamentals of a shooting game just arent present. There is 1 Map released so it gets old fast and 75% of the time the game ends on military base.. very repedative.,Not Recommended

This game was awesome when it first came out however the more they try to add to the game the worse it has gotten. You will have good days where servers run smooth but those days are rare. The consistancy of weapon damage is terrible one day an M 16 will wreck and the next day it will be complete garbage. When you think you have the jump on someone and shoot them four times direct hits think again they turn and one pop you when you ahve a level 3 helmet with a UMP. Armor is super glitchy put a patch to fix it an only made it worse. The list goes on and on it just is slowly killing the game. Instead of fixing what is known problems they keep trying to add more Vaulting weapons weather. JUST FIX THE GAME!!! I loved this game and took a break from it to come back to have it be almost unpalyable. Hackers are every where now speed runners with aim bots are the best. You even see them in nearly every top streamers stream. Devs are doing nothing to fix the issues and it has become an infestation of who can have the best hacks. To those who buy it best of luck.,Not Recommended
"I've held off from reviewing this game for as much as I can hoping that all the things wrong with it would get fixed but no dice. This game in its CURRENT state is not worth a recommendation. As with anything there are good and bad points to bring up. To not seem one sided I thought I'd list both. Really fun WHEN it works. Playing with friends in either duos or squads is solid. Great teamwork building game. Runs pretty well even on the lowest settings. However there are more negative things with this game currently than positive. The gameplay is laggy. This bothers me as much as it does considering it was pretty decent pre Sanhok update. I expect a ""patch or update"" to be just that and not a step backwards such as this was. Then there is still the issue with hackers. I don't think I've ever played a game that had more hackers playing than this one. The whole ""banned however many millions of hackers playing"" is not something to be proud of guys. It should not be that easy for millions of people to be hacking. Another thing is the total lack of accurate weapon stats. Dont appreciate it when a game says weapons like shotguns are ""one shot"" within a certain range and when I find myself in those situations with a shotgun its now a 2+ shot scenario. Whereas everyone I go up against almost always one shots me but from futher than ""one shot"" range. Not to mention the shooting through solid obstacles and the game registering a ""hit"". This is something that really irks me considering it shouldn't exist seeing as how no attachments in this game allow for bullet penetration through barricade blocks or solid stairs. Also the vehicles are very one sided as well. Dont like it when I'm driving a vehicle (UAZ) and my car is taking a ton of dmg and explodes from one clip of gunfire as i drive by someone who is camping say the edge of the zone. Yet in another game a different person is driving the same vehicle and is driving by and I unload 2 if not 3 clips into their vehicle (because they stopped/turn around) and then it explodes. Basic math says 30 does not equal 60 or 90. I really just hope this game gets fixed. It has great potential. All of which is marred by the fact that making money is the main goal of this company. When really if you focused on fixing all the problems with this game and did so then people would maybe be more inclined to buy one of the many in game purchases you guys keep adding. In its current state however I will not put a single penny into this game.",Not Recommended

Pros Game is fun to play solo or with friends You can make money off of playing and selling items/boxesCons Takes way to long to get into a game.

If you even think of getting out of a car while its moving.. and i mean even creeping forward Consider yourself dead. If someone even touches the gas when you are close to the car you will most likely get knocked out.. hasnt been fixed in any updates so far Window jumping can be a nightmare. sometimes when in battle and trying to get the position on the opponent it wont let you jump through a window many spots in the map where you become stuck and cannot move and have to abandon game.,Not Recommended

It is a great love+hate game. I like the concept and the gameplay. But the bugs are seriously ruining this game. I've had desync issues so bad that I have shot a shotgun at someone in front of me and all that happens is white dust comes out and when I check the killcam turns out I was looking all the way to the right. The game needs its bugs fixed and the game being this broken at this point in time is absolutely unnaceptable. Lately I have been playing Fortnite more not only because the game is far less buggier but it also ties in with PUBG's 2nd issue. The maps are far too big. If you drop across the map and the safe zone is on the other side good luck getting there without a vehicle. Not only this but its so hard to find players. You spend 30 minutes walking around barren buildings looting then when you get in combat you are not prepared because the monotony wore you down to the point where you aren't even focusing. I know they are adding a new map to fix this but what good is that if there is no map selector? I hate the desert map but Im forced to play on it because there is no way to pick the map I want to play on. This game is at times amazing but unfortunately these days it is an absolute annoyance to play. I play Fortnite more nowadays and I hope this game can actually fix itself to a functioning and playable state.,Not Recommended

When I fist got this game it looked rather promising and I waited out the major bugs to see if it would get better. Until for over the past 150 hours of gameplay my game will crash everytime I try to launch it and when I do get into it it will crash right after I exit to lobby from a match.

Ive played this game since release. It was a fun game to play with friends but at this point in time it is terrible. 25Mb updates everyday you have to pay for keys to open chests (which you didn't have to do when the game first launched) and when it should be getting updates to fix the optimization it gets updates for a new cratee instead.

Pros Fun. This isn't normally my style of first person shooter but dang is it fun. Easily the best Battle Royale/Survival/Loot Hoarding FPS game out there. Sorry H1Z1 even with the cons you don't stand a chance.Cons Hackers are frequent enough to make the game frustrating to play. Lots of players from the AS/SEA regions playing on NA/EU servers. Some of these players are hackers the rest gain the benefit of ping abusing the game's sub par net code the influx of cheaters exploiters and toxic players are ruining the game.Bluehole fixed most of the optimization issues so we just need the netcode hacks and ping abuse fixed now.,Not Recommended
Game was fun for a while now it is compltely overrun with cheaters. I mean it when I say at LEAST half of the active players are cheaters of some kind. In the past few weeks I can't recall a single match where the death cam didn't show that the player who killed me had instantly snapped to my head through a wall or across the map. Every. Single. Match. The vast majority of cheaters come from China and until the Devs decide to region lock China to their own servers this game is downright unplayable. Do not buy this game until the Devs lock out China. And certainly do not give them more money by buying keys if you already own this game.,Not Recommended
Played for 1000+ hours prior to AU servers being broken. Unable to play game outside of third person now without having 200+ ping. Would not recommend for Australian play anymore which is a shame because its actually a decent game.,Not Recommended
This game used to be fun prior to official launch. Now it is rampant with cheaters and there isn't even one game that goes by that someone isn't using aim bot or some other new type of cheat. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is a complete waste of money and time. Once they get all and I mean ALL cheating under control it will be worth it again but for now this game is run by cheaters with no policing to stop the cheating.,Not Recommended

I did not log in steam for couple of months but when i log in steam today the developer just any how banned me without any reason and i played for only 8 hs.

And now i ask for the refund.,Not Recommended
Was an awesome game before the flood of cheaters.When people openly cheat with speed and teleport hacks and obviously using aimbots it gets anoying.And with obvious i mean looking through a windo in a room of 3 people turning around in hihspeed and give everyone just enough headshots (2 if you got a helmet) in less then half a second.

Product received for free. I got this game as gift from a friend he's played it much more often than I have and yet both of us are highly dissatisfied with what it has become.

So this game is actually a lot of fun I alwasy bashed it because I thought the idea was stupid and wouldn't be any fun at all. But here's the thing 1. The world mechanics are kind of bad so be prepared to be killed by being stuck between something constantly 2. Be prepared for the vehicle mechanics to be basically a joke (idk if anyone who created pubg has ever driven a vehicle before). You'll hit huge jumps and die off of a blade of grass or you'll swerve so badly off of a mild turn into a tree and explode. 3. PROBABLY THE MOST AGGROVATING the gun mechanics you'll see what I mean when you start tinkering around with the different guns. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY THE ONLY REASON ANYONE HAS ISSUES WITH THIS ING GAME IS THE DAMN CHINESE HACKERS!!!! IT is SO prevelant I literally did not listen to the reviews because I thought it was butt hurt kids who were bad but any time you make it to top 10 just be prepared for some chinese scripter kid spinning around with aim snap on your head to kill you. After the 10th time of this happening I just had to write a review who cares if you get called racist pubg it may be time to consider region lock with how often this happens. Its getting pretty ridiculous.,Not Recommended
Great game sadly ruined by the immense amount of hackers from Asia. As everyone else has said before this game needs region lock. It is absolutely rediculous the amount of Asian hackers you see on every server but their own. I can't even count how many times I have made it to second place only to watch my death cam see their aim snap onto me while I am still inside a building. This is absolutely destroying a game with so much potential. Until the developers get over their false sense of self rightousness and add region lock it will continue to lose players.,Not Recommended

I do not recommend buying this game. Besides the technical failures of PubG the developers continue to make cheap 'cash grabs' from the player base. Not only do you need to pay for the game they also try to get money from micro transactions to open loot crates. When you win a battle you get a reward called BP. You may spend this reward currency to get crates for cosmetic rewards. Now they have locked some of these crates so that you have to buy a key to open them. No thanks. And if that wasn't enough this game is ruined by cheaters who are primarily from China. To this day cheaters are continuing to ruin games. And when you report them you will never find out if they are banned or otherwise. Do you receive compensation for having your game time ruined by a cheater? Nope. Here buy a key for the crate that we have locked. Great game idea and thats about it. Poor developers cash grab and riddled with cheaters. I would like my money back.,Not Recommended

$30 Lag simulator/Yellow Plague Battlegrounds If you enjoy large scale battle royale games where lag and chronic desync is your biggest enemy then look no further as this glorified heap of s h i t e is the game for you! You want fast paced action? No problem! Simply land at School Hacienda or Potato and enjoy being killed by the weapon youve been attempting to pick up for the past 15 seconds. Probably by some c h i n k tard named Gongxianshu who has no f u k ing place being on our servers to begin with. Fun as f u k boi! In it for the long haul? Great just land in the middle of f u k ing nowhere and spend 15mins looking for that acog scope only to be killed at the first sight of action thanks to a tantalising mixture of p i s s poor bullet registration and desync so bad youll get panned from across the map probably by some c h i n k tard named Gongxianshu who has no f u k ing place being on our servers to begin with. Fun as f u k boi! Theres no pinglock (chinglock) so oceanic servers in particular are infested with 80% yellow monkies who are at the very least only in our servers to amplify and exploit the chronic desync. Servers run at a whopping 17 ticks. To put this into perspective CS GO has 64 and 128 tickrate servers which is largely and arguably the only reason that basic af game is in any way successful. Overwatch only had 21 tick servers upon initial release but was quickly upgraded to 63 tick servers due to massive outrage at the poor competitive performance of the 21 tick servers and thats on games that dont need to support 100 players at once. To put it simply what you see and what the server sees are 2 totally different things on this pathetic game. I would not bother with this game until the servers have been upgraded (after over a year of hundreds and thousands of complaints posted on various media platforms and nearly constant server issues its f u k ing obvious this is never gonna happen) or at the very least have a simple pinglock implemented to mitigate the effects of Chinese monkies exploiting desync on our already pathetic servers when they have 3 of their own servers to go to.

Because you have to play with dozens cheaters and nothing is changing from a really long time. Still 99% cheaters from Asia is at european servers still they have got high advantage beacuse of high ping because of blue blood and cheats off course. Next thing are patches most often you don't see any difference. Where are new maps where are new game's modes?

"The game itself is very enjoyable. It was gifted to me and I will continue to play it in hopes that it will improve. However I can't recommend it right now for two reasons 1. Optimization is awful. I'm not just talking about framerates here. Talking painful load times new match entries that never load and require restart paradrops where the buildings don't completely load for you parties that can't queue if someone logs out without dropping party first requiring them to reform etc. It's just a mess and it seems to be an acceptable mess because instead of trying to iron out the bugs they have a ""reload menu UI"" button built into the main menu for when it stops working. I have never seen that kind of hackery in any other game.2. Banning players for ""stream sniping"" and other questionable reasons. I think this behavior really demonstrates a level of immaturity in the developers. If someone decides to stream their gameplay online they assume a risk that people will use it for a competitive advantage. Or banning people for using an unintended glitch to their advantage when it occurs. Early Access is effectively a paid beta. If we as customers are supposed to accept that the game is going to have bugs with unintended consequences the developers should accept that too and it's their responsibility to fix those bugs not blame and ban the player for pushing the boundaries of them. Maybe if this were release there'd be a case to ban people for exploiting but I don't think you get to pull that garbage in Early Access. Fix your game.",Not Recommended

"This game is far more appealing than Fortnite to many audiences and the developers know that. The ""realism"" looks and gameplay are great. On paper.Bluehole/PUBG Corp have shown time and time again how careless they are for their customers. Bugs that have been present since Beta releases vehicle mechanics poor FPS management rubberbanding REGION LOCK and so forth. Better yet instead of fixing said points they rather file lawsuits and ask for MORE of our money via ingame ""passes"". They rather release a new map new guns and new cars to attract audience rather than care for existing clients they REMOVE the option to choose what map you'd rather play and instead add new weapon skins.Unfortunately I will continue to play this game. Issues persist for some people but can't stand the competing games. However I will not support PUBG and will not pay a single penny until they resolve their issues and development management and priorities.",Not Recommended

"Propably the best game desing among battle royales. Much more interesting than H1Z1. Without cringe stuff like ""magic"" items or building in fornite. However its pure tragedy. Optimalisation is pathetic. I had to buy 1080ti to have any ""pleasure"" playing this game. Amount of glitches is immeasurable. From car physics through item pickup lag to the shooting mechanics. Mouse had some weird delay. Weapons are pretty random. Sometimes full mag from AR is not enough to kill sometimes u get 1shooted from 50m with a shotgun. If u start game 5th time and u get colt the only thing u want to do is kill urself with it. Vaulting is buggy af. Sometimes u cant jump throung fence sometimes u go to the big window and u cant vault through this just because u cant. Every day i have dumb 25 mb patch that does nothing. Developers make some event modes like crossbow only where people just fistfight cuz sometimes hitting some1 in close range with any weapon especially crossbow is impossible due to lags and warps. Not to mention about crashes ""server is busy"" communicates. Summary Game idea Brilliant / Execution after playing this 400hrs like myself u want to execute urself.Edit Sorry but forgot to mention it This feeling when u play 25 minutes match get to top10 even with all this lags and glitches.

"I enjoy playing this game I really do. I've met many good fun players on PUBG Discord servers for teaming up together as well as enjoying the game in solo matches. Compared to other battle royale games that are out right now it has just the right blend of gunplay and vehicles so that firefights feel intense and engaging. Despite the problems that are in this game when it works it works so damn well. During Early Access I held off on my complaints because bugs and network issues were things I fully expected.But this isn't Early Access anymore so I'm going to treat it as such.I've played though all the iterations of this game starting from it's Early Access release on Steam until now and I can't deny that there hasn't been significant improvements. They've reworked the grenade systems vehicles physics and sounds tweaked FPP to a playable level etc. etc. On top of that the jump to the updated Unreal 4 has seen major FPS increases all around and some slightly better visuals. The vaulting system as well as the animation work for character movement is top notch and definitely benefits the variety of gunfights in this game.Now on to the bad which I hate saying there is more than there really should be.Most of these critiques come from my own personal experiences but I feel a large majority of the players in this game would agree with me. Firstly the network/server systems in this game are just not up to the standards they should be for a ""released"" game. Rubberbanding and ping/latency lag between clients is a common occurence and is almost expected to be the cause of death in many cases. For a game developer trying to promote their title as an upcoming E sport is kind of laughable when the online server tickrates can't compete with the likes of CSGO of Dota 2. I can see how it will be more difficult to bring PUBG's servers up to that standard because it's a very different game compared to most E sports but it's still an issue that needs to be addressed.Talking about bugs/glitches most of these are minor when compared to the bigger issues but I can tell it frustrates people enough to the point where they'll make Reddit posts about it so I'll discuss this a little bit. Just recently a patch was released that fixed a collision issue with chain link fences in the game where one side would have no bullet collision (you can shoot thru it) and the other would have collision. Needless to say there are still some chain link fences that haven't been fixed. While this is only one very minor issue among many others (such as models not rendering at long distances or wonky vehicle physics) it's still an issue nonetheless and it does need to be addressed. Not to mention that in terms of the quality of updates and transparency with the community which PUBG Corp/Bluehole have a terrible reputation with making updates that don't entirely fix the problem or make it worse doesn't help in improving that said reputation.And finally I'll try to tackle the controversial topic of cheaters and the as PlayerUnknown himself calls it ""xenophobic"" behavior of the playerbase towards China. This issue is probably the largest by far going off of the massive amounts of hate I see on the Discord servers I play in as well as the attitude of people I've played with in those Discord servers.I'm honestly baffled as to how big this problem has grown in the past couple of months but maybe that's just because most of the online multiplayer games I've played through Steam always excluded the Chinese playerbase on most accounts. In September of 2017 CSGO saw a release in China through Perfect World and up until then I never realized just how big the Chinese playerbase for games was until then they needed their own version to play on. So it's no wonder that PUBG has been breaking Steam records it's because they're including everyone in the whole world. To put this into some perspective PUBG has the majority of its players from China about 60% or so. Then you look at the amount of hackers that have been banned 1.5 million. Quite the impressive number for a game that's only been around for roughly 1 year considering that again the majority of those hackers come from you guessed it China.I don't hate the Chinese that's not the point of what I'm trying to say here. What I will say is that it's stupid as a developer to look at this problem and say that the minority is being ""xenophobic."" Nobody would have an issue playing with people from other countries if they played fairly and I suppose that's what a system like Battleye is for. But it's pretty clear that Battleye isn't going to be enough if the minority is going to be as vocal as they are about it. People want this game to be better in so many different ways and that's why Steam has as many negative reviews about this game as it does because the minority of the playerbase knows PUBG isn't perfect and that it can be better. I don't see what's holding PUBG Corp/Bluehole back from implementing changes that would improve the game as a whole for the people who actually want this game to get better rather than not really saying/doing anything. That's the same reason I stopped playing CSGO competitively it just felt like the VAC system wasn't enough and Valve wasn't doing much to fix the problem.There's no best solution to this Chinese hacker problem that I can see. Many people want all kinds of things like hardware ID bans region locks ping locks etc. Truthfully I've only ever played with a legitimate Chinese player once and he was playing with an English speaking friend of his that would translate what he was saying back to the whole squad so we could all still work together. I suppose the fear of splitting up the PUBG playerbase by region locking half of the world to the other or forcing the Chinese to player on their own version of PUBG is that it would look bad by Steam stats since the concurrent player count would be halved (as of writing this PUBG has hit 3 million). Ping lock looks to be the safest solution to this mess and there are many games that do implement this already. Call me xenophobic for saying that but it would improve the experience for many people who want to see this game improve in a meaningful way myself included.Anyway that's pretty much all I have to say about PUBG. Who knows maybe within a couple months we'll see massive improvements/changes blah blah optimism blah. Given Bluehole's track record in the past I doubt it but that could change.Oh and Mr. Greene please bring modding into this game at some point soon at least some modified Unreal Developer Kit for PUBG that we can use to build our own battle royale maps with. You said it yourself you want to find the next ""PlayerUnknown."" For someone that came from the Arma modding scene to be so heisitant about releasing modding tools for one of the most popular games on Steam the next ""PlayerUnknown"" will never be found by only offering ""custom game"" options that are limited to a simple UI. Heck if you really want to do that take a good long look at the Halo games with their Forge mode and custom game options. Just a suggestion.Alright I'm done. Peace ya'll.",Not Recommended

Cons Luck based You'll find a red dot sight and the enemies all around you are getting assault riflesHigh respawn time 5 10 minutes between death and getting into a new gameGlitchy hit boxes Your shots won't register but be prepared for someone with iron sights to one shot you from 300 yardsSloppy damage indicators There's no visual indicator of where you're being shot from. Or any indicator for that matter.Extraneous bullet sounds Good luck figuring out where shots are coming from since you'll hear the shot the bullet flying by and the bullet hitting things around you. Oh and and only the sound of the shot itself will help you determine the flight path since the other two sounds are not in stereo...Other annoying sound bs Between the background sound affects and your insanely loud foodsteps you'll never hear an enemy coming unless you sit motionless. So prepare to be killed by people sitting in silent wait for you around every corner and atop every hill.Tedious inventory management Want to pick up some items? Enjoy picking them up one at a time or opening your inventory and losing all situational awareness. Forget auto collecting or auto equipping items that match your equipped weapon you'll have to open your inventory and manually do it (sorry PUBG Mobile gamers the PC version can't manage that because ???)Slow action mechanics Want to throw a grenade? Well first take a few moments to equip it then prepare to throw it then realize you're throwing it underhanded and take a moment to switch to overhanded. Now press a separate button to cook the grenade. Ok now you can throw it but you'll find that you now have a random throwable equipped in its place and no indication of what it is unless you pause for a moment wait for your hand to come up then squint at it to figure out what it is.Healing sucks Want to heal? Well first learn about the 6 different types of heals and the situations in which to use each. Don't worry you'll have plenty of time to read about them while you spend minutes applying 20 bandages in a row.Pointless graphics If you play on super low graphics enemies that think they're hiding will be visible to you since the folliage won't render on your machine. So playing on higher graphics settings hurts you.Pros The VSS is fun although you will lose most gun battles with it. If it wasn't for the constantly shrinking game play area it could be relaxing to curl up in a shack on the edge of the map and take a nap.,Not Recommended

That's players with sensitive helpers which ruin this game. If you see guy running on mid of the zone like in Call of Duty don't even try to conquer him... On reasume it's pretty nice game can give a lots of fun but you can get much more frustration from hackers very bad loot poor spawn of car especialy when you need one. You want to play? Buy it and wait for patch relase then play lot until you will reach that moment when there is more hack in lobby than normal players. Then you take a rest from this game to next patch.

Feels more like in an alpha or beta stage game compared to full release.,Not Recommended

This was once a great game but . . .1. The North American server is overrun with Chinese players which creates a number of problems other than the obvious language barrier trying to coordinate during a gun battle2. While I will admit that the majority of the Chinese players are friendly I also have noticed a drastic uptick in teamkilling. I have been team killed by my Chinese team members more times in one weekend than than I ever was in the first 6 months of the games release3. Cheaters cheaters and more cheaters ...no explanation needed ( see numer one above )4. The game has some serious lag issues and the worst part of the lag seems to be at the very begining when players are landing and everyone is scrambling for a weapon/gun which is the ABSOLUTE the worst time you want to experience lag.5. The latest release has introduced a number of bugs which by themselves are not deal breakers they do add to the overall fustration level when combined with previous points.The game can be entertaining with some of the funny things that occur in the game from time to time but overall I have to give the game a thumbs down until at the very minimum the cheating is under control. Some people claim that there are not alot of cheaters...but considering that matches have 100 players...it only takes 1 cheater to ruin the fun for 99 other players.,Not Recommended

Wether or not Battleroyal type games were around before PUBG this was the first one for me. Saying that it was understandable in the BEGINNING to have such garbage mechanics hitreg servers textures. I played in the alpha (or whatever the theyd like to call it) when it was just a little childrens project now its made over 700 million dollars and its still just as garbage as it was when i started.Now dont get me wrong i had a FEW hours of enjoyment out of this game it had my attention for a little while. My friends played it i played it with them most of those were okay few were fun. Between the lag spikes hitreg and just garbage loot system it really makes me wonder how people put up with it ?I dont like the way fortnite looks i also do not enjoy BattleRoyals anymore but if youre tossing between this or fortnite i highly suggest spending money on a game were the developers arent greedy and dont just want your hard earned $.

"Cant recommend this game in its current state. This game probably wont be at acceptabel levels of playability for another year maybe longer if the devs continue to add 6Gb updates containing Paid Cosmetics and only a handfull of actual bugfixes most of them minor. Also dispite the devs claiming to have banned thousands upon thousands of cheaters/hackers the ammount you run into just keeps increasing. Whatever automated anti cheat systems they have in place is clearly not sufficent and even ban people accidently at times which means alot of the bans have to be done manually which takes quite a bit longer. This game is technically considered ""finished"" because its no longer in Early Access but as with most games that ever set foot in Early Access and manage to get out its far from it. Appart from what ive already stated the game also has absolutely terrible net code. You'll find yourself getting shot by bullets that chase you around corners in the early to mid game on top of being unable to interact with or even SEE some of the objects and loot at times. These problems tend to dissapate in the late game but at the same time you'll get killed because of these issues without even making it to the late game. With this game in this bad of a state you'd think the devs would be focusing on fixing its many problems but as i said before they instead decide to add 6Gb of paid cosmetic lootboxes and when they do ""fix"" things it tends to break the game more than fix it. This game has alot of potential when it works its alot of fun but dont buy it now. Wait at LEAST 6 months to a year befor you consider this game.

The game itself is a unpolished gem!But!There are dozens of asian bots that are joining the games to farm the ingame currency get crates and sell the stuff on the market. So it does happen very often that you land on the ground and die because a bot kills you dozens of meters away through three buildings. Is it fun to play with this kind of ingame experience? No!Since the devs don't really care about the leaks in this game there won't be a real change to this problem. Sure they ban the bots but only to see that the game gets more sales in Asia thank to the bans. A real fix for this kind of stuff won't come. Damn business!By the way The performance on the EU and US servers is only crappy because of this damn farming bots!Another painful experience are the game breaking bugs. Just to mention some If you drive with a bike over 100 it starts to move on its own (on a normal street). Something similar happens with the cars. You drive on a normal plain field and the car hits a little stone (not bigger than a fist) and all players in the car get damage like hell. Mostly it happens that you shoot someone in the head and the person still stands. Nearly no realism in this. Most weapons are useless since the damage is far from being original. While dropping from the plane it happens very often that you land on the ground and still get drop damage. You don't even have to hit something. Many people complain about performance problems on the first run. Like the game itself needs plenty of time to display any content.Did I mention the cheaters? Well they shoot through walls. Normal players can't do that. The two maps are pretty boring. Sure they annouced more maps to come but sitting on two maps while the game itself is in final state is just not enough. Over 20 millions sold copies and the team doesn't even think about expanding and fixing the dozens bugs giving the pretty big community more content and making this game awesome. This is why I won't recommend this game.,Not Recommended

Not recommended in a current state. The dev were saying that Fortnite's version is stealing players from this game. I'm for one that prefer this game over fortnite but I can't help myself. I'm not enjoying this game as much as I used to in the past due to hackers and the fact that I can't even choose which lootbox I want to buy. There are chances that you will get a lootbox that require a key to open and you need to spend real money to get a key. I still like the gunplay in this game better than fortnite but I can't help it but feel pity for the DEV. They are the one destroying this game. There are still people who suport the game and like this game more than fortnite like myself. They haven't fixed the hackers issue that has been around since last year when I first made my review. I'm editing my review as of 6/28/18 or more than one year later and the hacker issue still exists. It's even worse now than it was one year ago. They added the fortnite season pass like system in game and it's bad really bad. So instead of fixing the game and try to keep the current player count they filed a lawsuit agaisnt fortnite and adding the new content. I'm sure people prefer them to fix the current issues before adding more contents and maybe even bugs in the game.

The Dsync in this game is the worst in any game I have ever played in my entire life.Also the games last longer then they should each game going on around 35 minutes if you get to the bottom 10 out of that 35 minutes you'll only spend about two minutes fighting someone if you're lucky enough to find them. The circles last too long which encourages players to camp in houses for the majority of the time resulting in there being close to no action untill later in the game which you most likely won't make it to seeing how kar98's spawn more frequent then Dp's the people who are camping for 25 mins of the game will most likely snipe you before you make it there.This is the only game I've played where I can get up out of my seat and make a bowl of oatmeal and come back not dead.The game is slow paced and broken. The leaderboards are trash as well I got top 600 in a few days just laying down in the grass hiding the majority of the game untill I get top 10. Most of the people on top of the leaderboards are just Wai Gua Chinese hackers it's an absolute joke of a game to take competitively.,Not Recommended
This game had a lot of promise sadly the developers just want more money the easy way. If only they realized that if they just kept loving the game and improving it more than they made new lootboxes they'd make more money and keep more players. This game still remains the only battle royale that I really truly like I think it's ok to play it since there isn't anything else to play like it but don't purchase the lootboxes or keys for them. Just waiting for the next better battle royale game and I won't ever look back.,Not Recommended

this game used to be good until the chinese took over. 4/5 games with squads im with all chinese. 2/5 of those games they team kill me an take my loot and i haev to report time and time again and the admins do not do anything about it. this game IS fun. but poor control on servers hackers and foreigners flood the servers making it unplayable for the average joe. at the end of the day its the fault of the people controlling this game.,Not Recommended
Been playing for over 300 hours and to be honnest i've had enough. This game is infested with hackers even though updates are released on a weekly basis as if internet was a given. The updates themselves usually don't solve anything. The glitches are tremendous consideriing this game is past beta. Every single server you'll go to 80 out of 100 players are chinese playing from china just for the ping exploit. No matter how many times i come back to this game i regret purchasing it. Want my advice? Go play Fortnite. It's free there's always a regular checkup on the bugs and barely any hackers and you won't have the slightest regret. If i could ask for a refund i would.,Not Recommended
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!Its geting worse with every new update.There is no anti cheat at all. Servers overloaded constant lag and bugs that are in the game from begining. Plus new ones with new updates.1 in 4 players is cheating.They baning 100k cheaters a week and same 95k cheater buing game back same day.Only winer Bluehole sold another 95k for same cheaters.75% of players are from China and they can join any server around the world they like.

"PUBG is a fun game. No doubt. This review is more of a warning about their support team Who as far as I can tell are a pack of mentally handicapped lemurs. They do very little to fix the problem this game has with hackers and have banned 100s of accounts in error. Some people have managed to restore their accounts many others have been told to pound sand. They will not give you any information on any accused infractions. They will simply lock your account and claim they do not do ""retests on bans as it is done internally.""If you ARE a hacker/cheater. Your ban is permanent. So good riddence. If you are the victim of hacking or cheating.....Your ban is permanent. So qq They will take your money and send their support team to kick you in the balls over and over and over and over while exclaiming the whole while how frustrating this must be for you. Cannot recommend as there is a reasonable chance you will be banned for no reason or for being the victim of a hacker (Chinese or otherwise).EDIT Blueholes ""appeal"" system does not exist. Their support staff are not actually trained to help you and won't actually respond directly to any questions or requests. This is one of the GREASIEST companies I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I am sure they have modelled their business' code of ethics to resemble that of EA because both carry the same stench of cheap whiskey and hot garbage on a summers day in L.A. Do not believe a word that drips from their encrusted lips. They are doing absolutely all to actually protect their player base. They are sure to get a couple legitmate hackers no doubt. However their policy of ban first and never ask questions is appalling (even if it is not totally illegal). You will not be asked to provide any proof because you are guilty. They will not accept any proof you provide shy of capturing the actual perps and bringing them to Blueholes offices alive. They will take your money ban you when you are hacked by one of the people they failed to protect you from then ghost you faster than that girl you ""really had a connection with"" from tinder did last month. Play the game. Or go play fortnite. They are both fun as hell. Just know you are really rolling the dice with these idiots.",Not Recommended

UPDATE Game is still Blue Hole only gives a damn about the money and not its player base. Go play Fortnite.As much as I have backed this game up and given it a chance since early access &amp the 1.0 release I'm starting to lean the other way in regards to favoring this game. Still too many issues for only having 2 maps and 1 game mode.The cheating is incredibly bad there are aim bots all over the place and you get insta killed by t accounts with a shotgun from 100 yards away. Sometimes with no line of sight while watching the kill cam. Until Bluehole can fix the cheating I'd steer clear and go play something else. Regardless of being past 1.0 it still feels like an early access game.,Not Recommended

This game is literally useless. Each game there's couple of cheaters that are able to kill you across the whole map. Comparing to CS GO CS was cheating free game 9 games in a row and there are always chinese cheaters. this game,Not Recommended
Pros The concept of the game is great and the gunplay is fantastic. (That's it close combat is though)Cons Desync/lag issues at the start of the match STILL. VERY low tick rate servers for the start of the match. (Good luck shooting someone at the start of the game because they teleport back and forth) Players with higher ping have peeker's advantage. RNG at the start of the game is too much with the lack of guns and armor if RNG is against you. RNG red circle. RNG blue circle. RNG availability of vehicles. RNG of crate drops. RNG of plane path. Hackers everwhere. ESP hackers. Aimbot hackers. Wall hacks hackers. Lack of foliage hackers. Recoil macro exploiters. RNG of getting needed 4x and 8x scopes. RNG of finding a rifle and sniper. China EU Aussie Russians South Americans and Middle eastern players are about 80% of the players playing on NA servers. (They like to have the high ping advantage D reportable offense of exploiting the game being a dumbass client side shooter) I haven't even mentioned all the game breaking bugs.....,Not Recommended
This game is AWFUL. So many good things but the bad out weigh the good by a lot. you will be killed by people with cheats more than people without (if your any good) and you will be playing in North American servers except with majority chineese people.

PUBG is a decent game overall BUT the one thing that has let it down so catastrophically is the fact that servers are on major downhill decline with it being impossible to find a match in the OC region. Sure I can play on other servers but the lag delay is just too much for the average player to cope with. If your thinking of buying this game don't spoil the developers by buying it now wait until they fix most of the current issues then buy it. I don't recommend by the slightest degree purely because it has had good times and has great potential to do so in the future if they can pull their stuff together and eventually fix this game.Was it worth the money? Yes. A loooong time ago.,Not Recommended

Honestly it's too late for buying this game to be worth it it's on a downward spiral at this point. just play fortnite or realm royale$30 game with a less consumer friendly monetization model than it's free to play competitors devs don't care about fixing the game so it has longevity just extracting as much money from it as they can before the bubble pops,Not Recommended

Amazing game that has lot's of problems. Fortnite performs better in every way and is way less taxing. This game want's atleast 4 cores to play well so extra cores from Ryzen are super worth it. With GTX1080 and i5 3570k 16GB Ram 4k this game is having huge framedrops in landing sometimes outright low 20fps. No ammount of setting changes is able to get around this. Either PUBG needs to upgrade their code or I need a new CPU with more threads. Reccomend only if your PC can run Fortnite at max settings and 4k and still have some headroom.,Not Recommended

Loved playing it. That's right loved with a d at the end because now it is pay to even open the thing that you work hard to get.

So thanks but no thanks do not buy the game unless it is on sale for like 5 dollars.,Not Recommended

This game has been out for more than a year now and it still does not run properly it is poorly optimized.

Please save your money,Not Recommended
Even with the recent updates to game it feels like a let down. Much of the content came far too late compared to PUBG's competitors. Broken maps laggy servers and bugs galore all weigh the game down. While many of these things were not issues in the past the length of time and persistancy of these issues have bittered the experience. Moreover the actions of the parent company in regards to recent legal action has left a bad taste in my mouth. Don't support these greedy developers lootboxes on top of a $30 $40 purchase is gross.,Not Recommended
Wasted 800 hours on this trash game hoping that they would improve it. There is still tons of cheaters the servers are so bad that you are getting shot 1 2 secs behind walls. Don't waste your time BlueHole will never fix this game. They are more interested in making more loot boxes to suck every dime from its deminishing user base.,Not Recommended
The game is fun but incredibly broken and the devs aren't helping.Between disabling keybindings to jump over knee high walls before the vaulting is ready for launch and threatening to ban people for editing their configuration files I just can't recommend people buy from this developer.Aaaand of course now they've brought in ads to a paid game...great.,Not Recommended

"If you are reading this chances are you are thinking of investing $30 into a wildly popular battle royale genre game. This game has the potential to be the best of its kind but bottom line the one thing this game cannot and will not resolve is the hacking. Now I realize to some degree most games have problems with hackers. It is the nature of the beast and unfortunately you get some people with a few dollars to spend who would rather cheat than actually learn how to play a game that has a very simple concept Be the last to survive. It could be the a very pure and enjoyable experience even after being killed in the first minute but alas it isn't because depending on time of day and day of the week the majority of the near 100 players are hacking to some degree. Yes there are different levels of it. There is always the guy that sits 1.5 km from you that can shoot you through the other side of a mountain (yes this has happened and the only way I knew how I died is was the death cam). There are the ESP hacks where the hacker knows exactly where everyone is at which is a huge advantage because stealth and tactics plays a very important role to success in this game. There are no recoil hacks and aimbot hacks. Speed hacks. I am sure I missed several others but you get the idea. So I random duo'd with a Chinese player (who spoke English pretty well) who told me about his hacks and at first I didn't really believe him but he was like a heat seeking missile when we landed as he found everyone in our vicinity and killed about 10 guys in a matter of 2 minutes which in a game like this is virtually impossible unless you have these advantages. I watched this guy melt everyone and it was obvious he was happy with himself and actually advertised his hacking site to me over chat. Since it doesn't appear god mode exists (yet) I team killed him and exited out of game. Hacking in my eyes just enables the laziness of many gamers who are content on cheating to be at top of leaderboards. Intended or unintended this game embraces it. You have stats for a lot of different metrics. K/D wins win % top 10% headshot % and some weird rating system that embraces the 30 1 KD ratio and the 83% win percentage (again impossible if you are not cheating). It is my opinion that this game is not looking to eradicate these hackers it is just accepted because these hackers do pay some decent monthly subscriptions to maintain their ""fake"" greatness and I can only imagine that the hacking companies give the developers of this game a nice little payoff because otherwise there would be much more noticeable results with each patch to improve it for the legit players and yet it seems to get worse. I am certainly not a pro at the game I just like to jump in and have a little fun with a game with a great concept. The reason I wrote this is to make anyone aware that what they are buying is a game to which they will be playing on an uneven playing field even after many hours of improving. It isn't anything they would be doing wrong it is what the developers aren't doing to make it right. This game is massively popular and even I have devoted 450 hrs into it hoping at some point it would improve but I don't see it changing any time soon. If you like the challenge of playing others that have capabilities you will not have in game unless you hack this is a great buy for you and good luck to you. If you are like the majority of non cheating players and wanted a balanced game of you vs 99 others you will be sadly disappointed and frustrated.",Not Recommended
"I wish I could recommend this game... I really do. It is a great game and easily the best at what it does...But now the devs ignore the community that brought it up and are going back on their promises of no micro transactions. Their in game currency ""BP"" is used to buy cosmetics currently but will eventually only be usable to buy a CS GO style crate containing only 1 item. this crate will only be openable by purchasing a $2.50 key...So you'll get to spend your winnings to purchase a crate that you have to purchase a key for. If that sounds okay to you I am worried for the future of games. Don't let developers go back on their word. Don't let people turn their back on the community.PlayerUnknown if you ever read this... I had high hopes for this game but when you prove that your word means nothing how can we trust you not to totally change the thing we love? I respected you once. I don't anymore.",Not Recommended

"A 30$ game with a single gamemode and somehow they managed to make it unenjoyable with rubbish client server communication being the source of multiple frustrations inconsistent bullet drop (might be because of the client server thing aswell) a big vacant map that is somehow less fun to explore than Arma 3's islands and takes overly long to travel not being able to completely look up or down unnecessairily long matches awful optimization etc. Granted I have not retried this game but having seen a friend play it recently I am not surprised the game isn't doing so well as of now. It still feels rubbish to control and still have most of the issues I have previously mentioned. On top of that I've been looking at this game and I saw massive community backlash for many various reasons such as adding ads in servers from China potentially getting banned for eliminating an idiot who doesn't hide his map the same old flaws not being fixed etc. And microtransactions on a game we all have paid to test because the third world company that Bluehole is can't afford QA testers. Let that sink in microtransactions on a game that isn't finished. Yes okay it is cosmetic but its presence just screams ""give us more money we're greedy "" Worst of all there's already tournaments being held on a game that seems in alpha that's due in 11 weeks as of writing this.If you want the same kind of deal but fast paced and more responsive in terms of hit registration go play Fortnite's Battle Royale mode. It's free. Sure your money and time may have been wasted but it's not my problem if you haven't seen (what seems to be) its downfall from miles away.Or rub your weiner off. Anything's more fun than playing this game.",Not Recommended
This game is cancer... 1st and for most I will adress the reason this game is Bad....DESYNC It will never be fixed because it can not be fixed. They can Optimize the game forever and it will still exist. The reason is because not everyones systems are the same and not every Internet connection is the same.EXAMPLE If you could perform a test and have 12 different people in the same position and fire at them at the same time with the same gun vs gun armor vs armor scenerio the result would be 12 different outcomes. example 1 You kill the guy he never turns to fire.example 2 You fire the guy turns and kills you immediatelyexample 3 You fire the guy turns you kill him but take alot of damage example 4 you fire the guy turns and fires back but you kill him and take no damageetc.etc.... Now People will say that this is because of skill.. and you need to play more to get better etc.But remember this is a test of the same exact situation every time. Skill has nothing to do with Desync. You can play this game 24 7 for 10 years straight. The fact is that there are always going to be people with better or lesser desync issues then you it has nothing to do witth practice or skill it is just the SAD TRUTH of the game.They Know it and hopefully now YOU know it too.It will never be fixed because it can't be fixed . It is a sinking ship that they are trying to keep the hype going for as long as possible.So they can rake in as much of your money as they can. Keep playing if you want Just know you are Never on equal footing with anyone else in the game. Also don't be stupid and give them any more money because what good are the skins and cosmetics good for??... Nothing just filling in your own ego...and where does that ego go when the game dies??...Will you reflect back at that point and think All that money could've went to something real and tangible??,Not Recommended

"Despite the game being in early access the amount of bugs and glitches is yet absurd. And the servers are atrocious often lag and sometimes even crash. The hit registration is flawed at times you can stand behind a wall or tree and get hit from someone who's on the other side. Bullets starting at the barrel makes more sense than at the scope like in CS GO but looking at someone through a scope or sights only to shoot some bars or a railing is excruciating. Physics is evidently not Bluehole's strong side since bullets can't go through water any wooden railing bars or any thin piece of wood (except doors).How can a developer be so secretive about the contents of its game that it refuses to explain almost anything or release information? It's not state secrets and you're not an intelligence agency. Desciptions of add ons or equipment overall is extremely brief to know the specific differences between things like muzzle addons you have to turn to YouTube. And even then you won't know the entirety of it. Almost all variables and algorithms are hidden.""Esports ready"" is definitely one of the most accurate memes ever the arrogance and sheer audacity of hosting esport tournaments while having the game in this state is laughable and hugely annoying.

Laggy desync lets bad players kill you the spatial audio leaves much to be desired clientside blood markers make it look like you lit someone up then you watch the laggy death cam and only hit them once serverside. Alt tabbing is risky cause you don't know if it'll let you tab back in. Menu is terrible They decided to include bullet drop not sure why since your shots might miss anyway cause of the bad netcode. Price is too damn high for what they're offering here.Pros crates and keys,Not Recommended
A game that is sometimes fun with friends but is mostly washed away to the garbage bin due to the horrible server preformance massive amount of hackers and textures that appear to be made by eight year olds. I can't see why the game has such a massive player base with all of it's clear as day issues. I wouldn't spend a dime on this game until they fix the bad hit detection due to poor server preformance and region lock areas to prevent unneccesary high ping and Chinese hackers from straying from their own servers and polluting ours. I would think these are basic things to include in a competitive shooter with such a massive player base but I guess not.,Not Recommended

a really short review for pubg The combat is actually pretty good it takes skill to play this game and i love a really steep learning curved game because i can brag how good i am (no im not good tbh but you get the idea).The game still has many bugs and inconsistency like bullets are not hitting an enemy even though i was at point blank range and my crosshair was on the guy's head and i was ADSing with my AKM but still for some reason the game decided that it was not a headshot one of the bugs in the game is how terrifying it is to ride bikes and its not because im afraid to get shot its because im afraid this bike gonna launch into the sky and crashing down like a meteor and kill me instantly.The guns...oh man some of them are just not even worth using because how random it is yes i am talking about the pump shotgun here . This shotgun can be really really good if you got lucky with the spread but then again i saw my friend shot a guy about 2 3 meters apart from each other and they have the same shotgun when my friend shot the guy (he doesnt wear any armour) he didn't die but when he shot my friend (who is wearing a level 3 armour and level 2 helmet) he instantly died with one buckshot to the chest with 100% health. I love the shotgun because its actually really satisfying to shot it but it doesnt work a lot of times because its so RANDOM.Conclusion i want to like this game but I CANT STAND FRAME DROPS AND HOW INCONSISTENT THE GAME HIS WITH EVERYTHING IN THE GAME. 4/10 would never pick up pump shotgun again.,Not Recommended

THIS GAME IS LIKE ANAL SEX BUT YOU ARE THE CATCHER AND BLUEHOLE IS THIS PITCHER!!!!! Ive been dreading this review for a long time now in hopes that they would fix this game but I was sadly mistaken.

RNG is all this game is ESPORTS READY AM I RIGHT. Lets add more skins itll bring people back for 2 matches until they realize we still hvent optimsed this game fully. hit detection is still trash. ARs are trash shoot someone 8 times and they still kill you with a ump in 3 shots. This was supposed to be CONS but THE WHOLE GAME IS A CON. Theres more to be said but you get the point. Save that $30 and spend it on a different game and if youve already bought it get that refund if possible. If anyone from S.h.i.t.h.o.l.e reads this THANKS FOR ING ME.,Not Recommended

Forest Gump Simulator 2017To start it is not a terrible game. But I wanted it to be so much better. The concept is very fun. The execution leaves a lot to be desired.From my experience it is a rewardless game that you can come second place in without having even fired a shot. Or if you are really lucky maybe even first by jumping the last person with your fists and hiding the rest of the game away. But that is unlikely.So you run and run and run grab gear get a 10 kill game going and poof some guy without a kill ends it all because he had a better hiding place in the last circle. And then you get some coins for a randomized loot box. There is no permanence or consequence to any game or action taken and no matter how well or bad you do you could end up the winner or loser based mostly around a slot machine pull. Huzzah.That is if you get through the terrible optimization. My computer is no longer the most amazing thing on the market but it was just a short year or so ago. And I have yet to find a game I couldn't run on the highest settings and not get 50+ FPS. Until now. In fact there are points in time when it would drop as low as 20 FPS on a custom medium high setting. It was shocking to me. And this isn't because of the amazing blow your mind graphics of the game either...At the end of the day I didn't find it fun. I found parts of it fun but it was more of a chore than anything. Drop here pick stuff up run run run then die or hide. Repeat. If you can get through another stuttering game.And I am not even one of the people complaining about banning hackers and all the other complaints.Not a horrible game. Not worth the price tag. May pick it up again later down in development to see if things have improved because it does have potential. But if you love mashing the run button very recommended.,Not Recommended
Plain and simple. Would not buy again. It went from a fun game that brought you and friends to work as a team to get the dinners. Now is just a bunch money grabbing from the company and losers who think skins make them not losers. Crates used to be earned not bought. Once they changed that it all went downhill.,Not Recommended
servers sucks and it will disconnect while you playing in the match .,Not Recommended
Fun to play when it isn't bugging out. But I can't reccomend this game as the developers are a bunch of money hungry s that won't do anything to fix the game but just introduce new (and half arsed) ways to get more money out of you. And if you're a streamer they'll come round to your house and suck you off but everybody else they will come round and on your doorstep. Streamers get the full game game where you can host your own custom server to practice or play other game modes the rest of us just get half a game where official servers are the only things we can play on. ...for the same price we payed for the game for. Don't support these absolule money hungry s.,Not Recommended
Buyers beware what your getting yourself into. Although this game may have its moments they are sadly burdened by the failure of anti cheat implementation which is apparently constantly under development but to no avail. The larger issue is mind boggling an unpolished title is allowed to utilise the market place where items are are sold and profits made which is the bread and butter of the modern unemployed hacker the developers are 'enabling' this fraudulent activity to occure without any form of restriction nor sense of wrong doing on their behalf not to mention steam thinks its a good idea to float this game on their platform. These forms of practice are entirely unacceptable and a massive dissapointment to the true community both steam and Bluehole should be ashamed at this point niether seems to claim any responsability for what they enable and i truly believe there should be legal repercussions for both parties.The difficulty I find is that the game is actually interesting moreso with friends hence the confusion by all the hate accompanied by a very large player base and so I say if you must play please avoid supporting paid loot crates everything we see these days has been granted the allowance by gamers and their needs dont let the devs tell you what you want by casually creating desire,Not Recommended
You need our money.. we give you money.. but we need the improvement for the game.. you give us skins more crate with key and more money demand.. just.. wtf man.. for those who already buy this game.. refund it!,Not Recommended
It's a decently fun game if you have a few friends to make a squad with.But holy the developers are the most incompetent I've ever seen outside of this game I've never seen unreal engine 4 run so badly it's a single threaded mess that brings even the newest CPU/GPU combo to their knees.Not to mention every single update gives minor performance updates followed by massive introductions of locked lootboxes you have to buy keys for cosmetics and now a stupid event pass? I have a feeling they know they've lost and are just trying to milk the thing for as much money as possible before the game's completely dead.A new map and E3 trailer hype aren't going to save this game unless they seriously up their production quality and cut down on the abusive monetization and/or go completely free to play.

After playing this game for a year I have had way too many issues to even recommend this game to anyone Yes the game was a good concept and was fun in the early days when it was less competitive. but since this game has turned into a profit machine I feel like the Devs have abandoned the issues of the game and only focus on feeding players new content which is just covering up the pill up of bugs and issues. And ever since the market place has existed it has turn crates no longer free to unlock and just is a big insult to original players who were able to get items for free well atleast after earning in game currency after matches.Problems The servers are very unreliable on some days it could be fine with no crashes or insane waiting times. but 80% of the time the game spawns you so late where you sit on a loading screen for 10 min only to find out you died in return. The servers also have a very or the game in genral has very bad of ping or player to player combat as although you might have aimed and shot a player while seeing blood dhedding off the enemy a lot of the times it does not register leading you into frustration and questioning youself are you really that bad of a aim.The game suffers from very unstable FPS drops during game play. Yes the game offers V Sync or smooth FPS but it does not hid the fact that a lof of the times even if you have a GTX 1070 the game struggles at medium quiality after the alst few updates. It also suffers from very poor rendering speeds of the landscape leading to unnoticable object in some combat situations with could be vital.,Not Recommended

To be honest it hurts me to write this but i got to do what i got to. This game was so popular the style game is so unique thats why it had such popularity.

It's addictive like any good game.I geniunely like this game so much but it's sad to see how far it had turn from good to bad.If you guys are willing to spend money into this game go ahead but it has turn really bad and it is not as fun as it had been since before and after 1.0. If you do buy it i don't want to spoil you with how this game is but i would like if you could enjoy and end up realising why people are leaving after awhile. if you do enjoy it please carry on and support'em as they might be more motivated to make this game better for returning and new players D,Not Recommended

Battle royale still has a long way to go before it becomes something worth playing but its addictive qualities have already pulled in a legion of players. Most devs are fully aware that battle royale is cheap to implement and can be infinitely replayed in an obsessive manner. A perfectly venomous system that can be monetised to the extreme exploiting as much money as possible out of the playerbase.Don't get me wrong there are fun moments to be had in PUBG but it isn't worth all of this. PUBG is really lacking in many areas when you examine the game in its entirety and the devs should not be rewarded for that.Someday there will be a battle royale that is successful in the right way but until then let's put an end to the insatiable greed.Let it burn.,Not Recommended

A running simulator except there's a 75% chance of getting shot by someone you cant see. I've played 10 hours on this game at the time of writing this review and I can already tell that it is riddled with bugs. The optimization is so awful. I turn my POV 30 degrees in any direction and my frames drop from 110 to 26? The desync and contrast in this game suck and it is really difficult to pinpoint the exact location of anyone shooting that is even romtely hidden. The servers lag when landing. I was playing duos with a friend once and the server literally froze while in the plane. Next thing you know the entire lobby is dropping the same place because apparently they were frozen too. I dont understand 1 centimeter hills that I am taking fall damage from or that my vehicle is ramping off of. I have to restart the game after every other squad match because if you don't you're just stuck in a queue that will never find a match. Apparently PUBG doesn't know when you leave the game either cause my friends are telling me to ready up after i have exited the game. Vaulting is still awful and my character looks stupid jumping into a wall. I spend too much time spamming 'F' attempting to pick up items on the ground which is especially annoying when landed in highly populated areas. When i drop a gun on the ground my attachments stay on but some how the firing mode always resets back to single which is really annoying considering how many times I've died when i've dropped a weapon picked it back up and its been in single fire mode. Prone is pointless on the miniroyale map unless you're hoping for a close up view of the grass. Overall this game has great concept but yet another poor execution and support from the devs. As I mentioned earlier i only have 10 hours in the game at the time of writing so i look forward to the hackers and high ping players from other regions.How does the devs address these issues? They attempt to sue their competition and then continue to release microtransactions. Great handling of their game I'm done ranting for now. 4/10 would not recommend.,Not Recommended

I gave this game a try because I thought it would have that ARMA open world feel with good CS like gunplay.After an hour of playing I can say that I do not enjoy this game. 3rd Person is tactically superior to 1st Person in every way but I prefer FPS so I'm already at a disadvantage. The formula for the game is simple enough but the game is lacking in a few areas Vehicle Controls are horrific. Boats are a deathtrap. You're more likely to ground yourself than manage to get down a river.Gunplay is very difficult and the telemetry between shooter and target is so hard to judge that you're screwed if you have anything less than a Rifle or SMG. Jumping mechanics are bugged consistently. There are areas on the map with items that seem like they require jumping to reach but are almost impossible to get to.There is no Hit indicator and HRTF is a bit watery in this game. Like it echoes badly. Thus it's very difficult to know what direction you're getting shot at from. Also the in game voice communication sounds like people speaking through a metal pipe. Terrible sound quality.All in all I can say that after playing the game for an hour both solo and with friends I didn't enjoy my experience at all.If the game changes significantly and FPS becomes less awkward to use (the gun feels like it's too low on the screen) I may try it again but at this point I can't recommend this game to others.,Not Recommended

Rubberbanding crashing into invisible obstacles when driving vehicles hit detection and no way to tell where people are shooting from are just the first of my complaints. The typical game is just either dropping in a large area where a lot of people drop and begging that you find the weapon first or dropping in a less populated area and spending 25 minutes running to the circle hoping that you wont be shot by a sniper from god knows where.

I would like this game alot and it WOULD be fun if the devs actually got of there asses and do something about cheating but nope they are to intrested in the money the hackers and cheaters bring in. DO NOT BUY THIS POS game.Revisit The game hasnt got any better they devs are still to focused on a new maps guns and microtransactions.. when there are still plenty of cheaters running around that should be the focus (unless they plan on crashing and letting another gamet take over). They seem to just ignore cheaters its...weird...almost like they dont care about there player base...hmmmRevisit 12/19/2018 The game still has not gotten any better with the most recent update they have completely screwed the FPS for a massive chunk of there player base not to mention more microtransactions. There are still handfulls of cheaters ( less then before but still alot) and now!! they are starting to come out with DLC and paid content.... Seems like they really could careless about the community and just want to keep filling there pockets.,Not Recommended

"EDIT 8/5/18 My review from a year ago still stands. I hate this game and have uninstalled. It is now in ""full release"". In reality it means full release with a side of early access. My lobby still has issues and I can't access the options to troubleshoot. I do not recommend this glitchy mess to anyone. There is a good foundation for a battleground game with PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS. Gun sounds make you feel like you are on the island. The land mass is large is gives for a number of exciting battles. Spawning and choosing a location to start the freenzy is good and should be built upon. There is a lot of potential with this game.That said there were too many bugs glitches unoptimized areas and de sync moments. I ended refunding because of the latter. The start menu would rarely load. Only after restarting steam or even my computer could I get it to load. There were awful texture glitches causing missed shots and more imporantly ruining the immersion. Footsteps never sounded correct. Crouching was louder than running through the building... Come on... Even in early access that was an easy one to spot in the beat no? I cannot recommend this to the many who see it at the top seller list. Dayz ruined early access for me and my trust with developers is thin. I would highly recommend waiting out the early access period and see what the devs offer on full release. This game is definitely not worth $60 dollars full release let alone $30 for early access.",Not Recommended
A great concept with fairly good execution if it wasn't for the major issue with cheaters and hacking at the moment this game would definitely have a positive review. At this point every other game results in a death from a cheater who's using blatantly obvious cheats/hacks. There are advertisements to cheats on the official forum that almost never get deleted due to lack of moderation.Then there's the issue with TONS of players from China and other Asian regions playing on the North American server because it gives a latency related advantage. The way the game works the worse your ping to the server the better you can play.Without some serious redesign of the regional issue and major overhaul in terms of anti cheat this game isn't worth spending any money on at this time.Ideally the Bluehole team will release some way for communities to moderate their own dedicated or authorized servers. It seems like the only way to ensure that players aren't cheating while in game.,Not Recommended
Welcome to PUBG where we can put on an international tournament in Berlin Germany with a prize of 2 million dollars but drag our feet and ignore our player base with ideas to make it better. We like to do server maintenance during prime time in North America oh by the way our maintenance usually takes twice as long as we say. Once server maintenance is complete we have to release another update because the new updated screwed something up. Lets not forget that we like to ban players for no reason and then offer no explanation on why we banned them so be prepared to buy the game twice (because we're really only after your money). We have a wonderful loot system! Once you play about 50 games and get a decent amount of BP you get a crate! But youll have to spend money to buy keys to open it! (Again we're only after your money). We've introduced a lawsuit against fornite because they're contantly coming out with new content every month and it usually takes us about 6 months to put something new in the game. Well I dont want to keep you distracted with all the fun you can be having and again thank you for your money!UPDATE Hi welcome back where we made a promise to fix our game but yet we still cant put out information like when we're gonna do server maintainence in the lobby because we are more concerned about you getting our stupid outfits. Just to make things fun we like to do maintainence during prime time in North America so dont plan on playing. The only way you'll find out is if you have a twitter. We're more concerned about advertising out new outfits than useful information in the lobby. Its really hard for us to come up with new and changing things so we just come up with stupid new outfits because after all WE JUST WANT YOUR MONEY. The one positive thing ill say is that we put dynamic weather into the game which makes it more fun but still ALOT of work to do but we need more money first!,Not Recommended

Okay so there are a lot of problems with this game for starters you have no indication of where the bullets are coming from so you just get sniped from out of nowhere and it doesnt feel fair at all second the game is riddled with aimbotters and wallhackers which make the game feel stacked even harder against you the aiming feels slow clunky and inacurate with the constant predicting your shots even though they never hit and don't forget about the overwhelmingly insane lag I can't return this game so it's just burning a hole in my wallet while fortnite is way more fun and FREE. step up pubg you guys are losing momentum fast.,Not Recommended
"The game is quite fun to play with friends but in my opinion quite boring to play alone. I find the game play very slow with lots of down times during which nothing happens besides running to the new zone only to get sniped by someone who was hidden there the whole time.The game play thing is personal opinion and I'm saying this to warn people who prefer faster paced shooters. However there are issues on which I believe everyone will agree.Lags servers struggle to hold the load and lags are fairly common you'll also often run into difficulties reconnecting after a game because the servers are ""too busy"".Kill cams full of glitches more often than not you'll see someone shooting way off you at relatively close range (where bullet travel times are not a thing) and still kill youCheaters the above point brings me to the issue of cheats. It's very hard to know from the killcam if the player who killed you was using something like an aimbot or not and yet it is well known from Steam and other discussion boards that cheating is an issue. Movements and vehicles how many times have I gotten stuck on the map for no reason... How many times the vehicle I was driving started tumbling unexpectedly? I'm not talking about driving full speed on a ramp like rock there are many videos of vehicles going crazy.Hopefully the new map in closed beta will offer a faster paced experience but the glitches and bugs remain a major concern in this game!",Not Recommended

Update 1/6/2019 FPS stuttering awful latency to the point where on my screen i get the first shot off but in death cam the other guy has unloaded a full clip before I even shot. Still don't get how they've made this game worseUpdate 10/13/2018 Game somehow has gotten worse and still contains people using hacks. Update Games still a laggy unoptimized piece of br&gt Honestly at this point it's really difficult to recommend this game. I had my fun at the beginning. Being in Early Access I could over look many things. But here we are a few months after the official release and it's still a buggy mess and cheating is rampant. You'd be lucky if you didn't have a cheater of some form in a game. It has taken all the fun out of this game. My friends and I have decided that until Bluehole gives a and puts out a half way decent cheat prevention system we're giving up on it and playing fortnite.

The hame is fun but there is a lot of hackers that are mostly Chinese that Bluehole refuses to region lock. Also no matter what server you go on you will almost never have a team of people who speak any language but Chinese.

Chinese players experience more lag then most due to their enviorment which often times results in you getting to cover successfully but they are lagging so much that they see you for at least another 2 seconds.,Not Recommended
Looks like someone wasn't making enough money from sales so they decided it was necessary to add Event Passes more cases keys and everything possible with microtransactions.

"I love how the video above says ""Closed Beta Footage"" while this game doesnt even come near pre alpha.Hitreg and server performance are utterly garbage and the game is full of bugs.Don't get me wrong i actually like the concept and the game design however as of now its not worth the money.Seeing how many ppl bought this game they already have the funds and possibilites to deal with its problems but sadly this is another example of an early access game that might be ""finished"" in 2 years when another competing early access game is releasedEdit So this game hit 1.0 already and got out of Early Access. They somehow managed to remove the lag which occured in the beginning of a match and added vaulting to the game which is a + to the devs however imho this is way to less for a game with such huge sale rates. Besides that pretty much nothing changed and old problems remain not to mention the horrendous optimization.",Not Recommended

Could be the best iteration of battle royale yet but it's falling down the stupid tree and hitting every branch on the way to the bottom. The devs refuse to fix major known issues and instead break more things with each patch.

"Don't buy this game plain and simple. The main reason I hate this game is because of the net code along with rampant cheaters. Getting shot around corners getting shot when your not even on the other players screen and sometimes you get a glorious cheater who takes 11 SKS shots to the body and just looks at you with a smile. This game in its current state is not worth a single penny. It is also poorly optimized even with a beast of a PC rubber banding and massive frame drops are a regular occurance. People from the Asia servers also love to join NA for a nice ping abuse advantage. Game just isnt fun for me so many glaring issues that the devs seem to be ignoring. This is an early access Alpah despite the 1.0 realse. In my opinion its a real shame if this is the new stardard for ""finished"" games. Rampant cheating the worst net code I have ever ecperienced in an FPS game BF titles included and complete lack of region locking making it impossible to have teammates that speak your language. Every fire fight feels like a laggy mess of bullets not going where you aim getting shot while completely around corners and watching kill cams only to see the guy who killed you lock onto your head through a wall. 0/10 would refund if I coud.",Not Recommended

Pros The UI is clean and easily navigable. The old map is more optimised and has been slightly revamped.Con There is still high rubber banding in the first few minutes from the countdown area to landing after which is fine. This defeats the purpose of going to high risk places as landing first doesn't even make a difference. Still no map selection. A basic thing to add in. There is terrible loot spread balancing. This game now has the worst hit reg I've seen. There is a ridiculous amount of hackers. Back to terrible optimisation with lower FPS and slow rendering. Parachuting was working for once and then after the last update it's useless again.This game manages to fix things then breaks them in the next update. Since the 1.0 update the game has gotten tremendously worse. Just wait for Europa Battle Royale or play Fortnite since it's free.

Just to quickly remind you what this game has become for battle points (game currency) you can buy cases almost every case costs 2 dollars to open. What you get in those cases generic uninspired items which you can sell on community market for like 3 cents. Also shouldn't forget to mention that the best items have drop rate like 0.001 %. So this is what this game has become. Adding to it poor performance little to non meaningful updates new battle pass extrem fail (non tradeable items most beautiful items expired within battle pass perrod) perf. problems with new map when there are many players in a little area (devs promised to fix the issue) and list goes on and on... But it's alright guys at least we've got e sports right! Developers became greedy and lazy potential I've seen in this game when it first came to steam is long time gone. Main point they've got their money right... Do not buy this game at this point just go and play any other BR or non BR game.,Not Recommended

I've been with Steam for a few years now and I have 196 hours for PUBG. I'm writing this negative review because of the cancer players which is THE CHINESE. The new Sniper WAR game is pointless because when I am teamed up with the Chinese they intentionally kill me so that they can loot my ammo. After that they just kill me for fun. Almost all of the WAR games that I am teamed up with Chinese this happens. I really hope that they REGION LOCK China because a majority of their players are absurd and cancer. I'll be staying with PUBG for a month but if this problem persists along with the cheaters (which is 99% of the time are Chinese) I'm finding myself a new Battle Royale game.,Not Recommended

I have played a very large amount of this game. I have won many games and am consistanly in the top 7 percent of players. I am fairly good and usually come out with about 4 kills per game. Recently the hacker rate in this game is off the charts. For those of you who have been reading through bad reviews by fairly veteran players like myself take heed. It is true. If you play around 15 games you will most likely die to hackers and very percarious situations. This last game of mine for example I was killed a solid 3 seconds after runing behind the wall. I was of course upset and proceeded to watch my deathcam only to watch this guy not see me at all literally shoot the stairs and I die. I was actually way off to the right in the other room. Whether this was due to this games terrible network code or hacking it is a great example of the massive issues this game still has. Calling it a 1.0 release is a joke. I have 200mb per second internet as well as an Intel Core i7 SSD drives and a Geforce GTX 1080 so lag on my end is not the issue. I promise after your first couple of hours this game will become infurriating because of these massive issues that need to be addressed before this game is going to get good reviews.

The game is extremely fun in my opinion. That being said I believe it has major flaws that could easily be address but some have only been made worse.1. Map RNG I feel the game time should stay the same have circle start to move sooner but actually move slower. This way if you do not find a car or if cirle dicked you you are not punished. (shouldn't change game pace just has more death via combat)2. Loot RNG I didn't really have any issues with this until they made loot less common a few months back. It was night and day when it happened. Rare items were still rare pre update but it caused the early game no weapon issue to become and actual issue. 3. Slow updates / Bugs It feels like the dev team still pushes updates at the same rate. I would think a game with 2 million + players would have hired many more staff and we would see rapid bug fixes as well as more new features.4. Red Zone Poorly implemented currently plenty of better ways to do it online.,Not Recommended

This game is one of the worst developed games I have ever had the displeasure of becoming a regular player of. The developers were very lucky to stumble up on a genre and format that was immensely satisying to play. They received 100s of millions of dollars and yet their game is still produced designed and operated worse than that of many developers with budgets in the thousands of dollars. I have no idea how a company of their size can operate with such sheer incompetence. It is embarassing and should be held up as an example of horrific game development.This is without mentioning their ridiculous and scammy monetisation system. I cannot wait until a developer with an ounce of common sense makes a realistic battle royale to challenge this and the players will rightfully be able to leave it in droves.I heartily recommend you avoid playing this terribly terribly developed game.,Not Recommended

Since this is my first review I shall try to keep it short and concise. As you can tell by the amount of hours I have put into this game I feel like I am able to review to a fair extend. This game is really fun to start with especially when you have a squad to play with. When the game was first released it had huge potential and the development of the game was there. That is until they found out they could make huge amounts of money by creating lootboxes keys and skins. The developers main focus right now is to create as much of these items to increase revenue. Hackers have also been a major problem in this game. Some steps have been taken to reduce hacking but sadly not enough. I would not recommend this game the developers do not have the costumers experience in mind when creating new content but only think about their pay checks.

Amazing concept terribly executed...When this game was released in early access it was actually a better and more stable game than its competitors. The game was fun to play (keeping in mind that it was an early access game) they updated the game frequently and it seemed like the devs were committed to making it as good as possible. The game became very popular and they made a lot of money on it so then I hoped that that would give them the resources to make the game even bigger and better than they first had planned. However the updates for the game became less and less frequent and the promises they had made for the game seemed less and less likely to being realized. I was still hoping that they would surprise us with a big update that made the game great but instead they just came with a few changes and a released the game as a final product.This game still has a good potential to be a good game if it develops for the better over the next years but for me it s totally unplayable and I can t enjoy the game because of all the bugs and terribly optimized gameplay and graphics. The menus lobbies and customizations are terribly bad and it still looks like the game is in a pre alpha early access state. There s a big lack of content other than the two maps where you can t even select which one of them you want to play. I would not recommend this game to anyone in its current state.,Not Recommended

I've tried and tried to like this game and I've even had a lot of fun with it. That being said the only two things that kept me coming back were (1) the hopes of bringing home a chicken dinner and (2) being able to get loot using the credits I'd earned with my efforts. Today I signed on and played a few rounds happy to get at least 1 kill per life and earn some points. Much to my dismay when I bought a couple of loot boxes I found that they were locked and I could only open them with keys that cost real money. I refuse to buy into this system and until they get rid of this elitist crap I highly recommend staying away from this game. I wish that the 'premium' loot boxes were the only issue with this title. The cheaters are everywhere on the PC release of this game and for some reason the developers refuse to employ some anticheat measures like BattleEye. Many of those cheaters are on the Asian servers and for some reason I keep getting automatically matched to those servers even though I'm in the US. Anticheat and region locks are pretty commonplace and for a game that's making so much money they really need to adopt both.,Not Recommended

"At this point in this games life span how its being handled is a joke. There's constant cheaters terrible net code and just god awful game mechanics.

Shooting someone in the head point blank rarely ever actually counts as a headshot and 9/10 times your gun just decides to work. Don't even get me started on how horrible the FPS is as well when the game first launched I would get decent FPS then PUBG Corp released the FPS patch in the beta and things were great. Now we are in the ""full release"" point of the games life span and the FPS couldn't be worse. At this point PUBG Corp is honestly more worried about making skins that people will buy than actually fixing a broken pathetic game.

I have hundreds of hours on this game and I am in the top 3% of duo players on PUBG.This game (was) fun.... When you're not destroyed by aimbot and ESP hackers in EVERY. SINGLE. GAME.This game needs a complete rework when it comes to ping and server tick rates. The client pc is the deciding factor which is why hacking is absolutely rampant and the high ping (read region lock please?) player wins.In the millions of dollars they have received in the success of this game they continue to add loot boxes to pinch every penny out of the consumer before this game dies completely because of the seemingly unfixable hacker problem (unless they 100% rework how the client/server communication and detection works and fully rebuild their anti cheat like that will ever happen! ).You know your game has an issue when they only rely on the player to report the hackers and ban accordingly based on the reports.They make posts to make you try to feel good about how they ban thousands of hackers daily and it is plain sad.The hacks will never go away therefore this game unfortunately is forever ruined.Buy this game if you want to get rekt by hackers in every single game you play who can aimbot iron sight shoot you in the head full auto with an AK from 400+ meters and never miss a shot.Happy playing.HERE WE GO 1/7/19 MORE HACKERS. WHOOOOOOOO. A year after my first review STILL can't come back to this garbage fire hacker infested game without getting aimbotted EVERY MATCH.,Not Recommended
Okay I'd like to start off saying that this game is fun in concept. I enjoy this pseudorealistic combat in a very expansive arena. You know why I'm disliking this bloody game. It is riddled with hackers left and right. I can tell you a game on this scale will not be able to catch them all. Don't just leave it a region locking a certain country for gameplay otherwise VPNs will just be the next big hit but also region locking the markets would make huge jumps to this game. I keep trying to play this game time after time but I always get upset at the end of the match. It isn't that hackers can shoot you across the map so much as it is that bluehole doesn't care in the slightest about anything other than money. We've asked for the slightest bit of action and we've seen absolutely none. I hope that this keeps you from making the same mistake I did and bought this game for myself/friends. Until I see Bluehole even acknowledge this problem (correctly) I will be sticking with Escape from Tarkov.,Not Recommended
Cheaters on every N/A server whom are all coincidentally Chinese. PUBG refuses to region lock these clowns. Barring any game balance or fun that you could discuss with this game the fact that they won't region lock China from tainting every other regions server is telling you who they care about (hint hint its the Chinese players)Plus they jumped on the money grubbing loot box train. You have to pay for keys to unlock crates and you can sell cosmetics on the steam market. The Chinese cheaters just sell this loot to buy more copys to cheat when they get banned.

When i have a problem in the menu it means something. A lot of fanboys and girls for this game for no real reason. I can never get someone to give me a actual answer when i ask ""what is good about it?"". Maybe in the future it will get better but it's been a while since release and it still is an eyesore.

This game was fun when playing with friends but the hackers have ruined this game. Now there are more games where I am pegged in the head with an AKM from insane distances/speed in 3rd person than not.

Also you have to pay $2.50 to open certain boxes that you already spent a ton of BP on which is absurd.,Not Recommended
Why pay $30 for something that is less optimized and less polished than a game that costs nothing.

Product received for free. The hackers are taking the joy out of the game. It's a real shame because it was such a fun game for my friends and I to play. But now it's just awful. One in ten games I could deal with but they're in almost every game. What's the point in playing? I cannot recommend this game to anyone at this time.Edit It has been four months since I first made my review but my thoughts still hold. I'veput many hours into this game and I've enjoyed the time playing it with my friends. But the Cheaters are destroying what was once a fun experience killing the game for so many people that play fairly. They have destroyed the credibility of the game destroyed a community. For that they should be ashamed but they will not be all they see are the dollar signs. While the devs continue to add crates paid crates especially with rare items that come at a high price on the market there are people and I will not point fingers but we all know who they are people that will farm the game for points to get these crates and the items to make a profit.I can not and I will not recommend this game to anyone as long as the cheating issue remains as prevalent as it is the measures put in place by the devs are next to useless. Each update used to bring me hope that we might get a few days of reprieve and actual fun but no longer. I've lost all hope that this can be fixed not without drastic measures that will never happen.,Not Recommended

"I think I've played this game enough to review it. Updated March 12 TL DR This game is unoptimized and absolutely terrible the developers are horrible and lazy and the Chinese players actively ruin the experience for anyone else due to the lack of a working anti cheat and lack of region locks. This is the quality control I expect from a Free To Play game. Anyone that says otherwise is captivated by baseless hype and the illusion that this game is innovative. I know it's lengthy but I strongly suggest you read the review anyways. I will update this review with more grievances following every major update.Long Version Is PUBG fun? With the right people that don't care sure and that's why I play it.From what I've seen those type of people are few and far between.Is PUBG good? No.Anyone that calls this game good is an idiot as far as I'm concerned.It's kinda like an idea for a game that someone chewed up spit out ate again and continued to regurgitate several times. Anyone that says this game is ""revolutionary"" or ""innovative"" has either forgotten or never played Minecraft Hunger Games. As childish and stupid as it sounds it's the exact same thing 100 players are dropped on a big map that shrinks in size and are made to kill each other.Except that was done 6 years ago and it actually ran on a vast majority of computers.The captivation with this game parallels the illusion that people had with DayZ SA when it first came out and how people kept saying it would get better. In fact it's exactly the same considering that DayZ is pushing for 1.0 in 2018 (certainly before the game is ready to be finished) and that PUBG had just finished doing the same thing. Bluehole had promoted the 1.0 release of PUBG the day that the steam winter sale started undoubtedly to avoid having to put the game on sale a marketing strategy that went completely unnoticed by everyone.Was the game finished? Hell no.Early Access worked better than the ""Full Game"".Since the 1.0 release I've been flung off vehicles killed by running down mountains killed by jumping and then subsequently sliding into the ground murdered by my vehicle exploding due to hitting a rock with the vehicle at 100% integrity my vehicle has straight up exploded just from hitting a bump in the road. But that's just what I can remember happening to me.To be fair to my friends that's not as bad as some of the problems they've encountered such as being stuck into a wall after dropping being downed by their own parachutes After the third fourth and fifth times stuff like this ceases to be funny and starts to become sad.Additionally the fact that a game ""released"" in 2017 has to have a button for refreshing it's UI is beyond sad and beyond lazy. There are texture pop ins on the main menu and half the time the text doesn't even show up correctly (an occurence that wasn't a problem before 1.0)And before 1.0 I wasn't dealing with Chinese hackers in every single match. Doesn't matter which server you use NA EU SA doesn't matter. If you look in the reviews you'll see thousands of people thumbing their s and praising Bluehole for things like this Fixing lag (If by fixing they mean ""fixing US server lag and incentivizing more Chinese players to server hop "" sure.) Decreasing terrain load time (They mean ""texture pop in time"" decreased from 30 seconds to 25.) Redesigned UI (Which like aforementioned doesn't work properly half the time.) Fixing desync (Sure now it takes me only 3 reload animations to load my gun and a full magdump to hit a guy five times.) Bullets now penetrating water (Unrealistic considering that supersonic bullets completely lose velocity 3 5 feet down.) Weapon balancing (Which doesn't matter when you have asians running around that one hit you with any weapon and negligible differences between armor tiers)And a bunch of other crap that makes it easier to catch hackers (such as the death cam) which is strange since if the game had a working anti cheat to begin with hackers wouldn't be a problem.How do I know the anti cheat isn't working? Because it doesn't detect cheats or .exe files when the game launches it relies on user reports for overview.Speaking of hackers let me illustrate my experience with them. I have experienced Chinese hackers with no recoil Chinese hackers who hit shots without even aiming in my direction Chinese hackers who shot and killed my team through layers and layers of walls Chinese speedhackers who outrun cars and vault mountains at lightning speed Chinese hackers who instantly kill every living player in the game and win immediatelyOddly enough I have never encountered a hacker who wasn't Chinese.How can I tell? The Chinese players kinda have two trends taunting people after they kill you by screaming Chinese/Cantonese wildly in your ear and making usernames with random letters followed by random numbers that no one can sensibly read. More telling is the fact that these cheaters have no problems taunting you after they kill you nor do they attempt to hide the fact that they are cheating as if the death cam isn't even there. I can't speak for the rest of you guys but constantly being called ""laowai"" and ""guailo"" on NA servers becomes a bit disillusioning after a while.Any promises of ""additional measures"" and ""improved anti cheat"" made by the developers have not been kept nor have their promises to ""take good care to not harm innocent players "" seeing as how shortly before making that statement they banned a streamer for a teamkill as well as having an auto ban feature in place which will punish people who disconnect from PUBG servers too many times.The existing anti cheat's effectiveness is even further mitigated by the fact that Chinese hackers will just buy multiple copies of the game on separate accounts. The developers' refusal to region lock China degrades the quality of the game daily but that doesn't seem to matter considering that some colossal idiots still give this game positive reviews on Steam.In fact the relationship between developer and player is far worse than any game I've ever seen. You can find countless steam reviews of people saying they were banned for ""stream sniping"" despite being unaware there was a streamer in their lobby something nearly impossible to discern anyway assuming the streamer has more than a 10 second delay.Nevermind the microtransaction incident which shouldn't have been a problem in the first place but god forbid they weren't going to try and milk this dry.Also to reiterate the fact that there is a button to refresh the UI which needs to be used constantly in order for the game to function is a sad excuse for Bluehole to avoid fixing the tiniest of bugs. These are developers who cut corners making their main menu work properly. Just imagine how much time they devote to major issues. Instead they'd rather pawn cosmetics on people to milk the game as much as possible.Despite what many Steam Reviews and ""critics"" would have you believe this is not the best Battle Royale game out there. Similar to DayZ Standalone which wasn't the best zombie survival game out there. Neither game was the best at what it did they were only the most fleshed out and complete which in PUBG's current state says virtually nothing.If this prevents at least one person from buying this gutter trash my time writing this will have been well spent.Necessary addendum",Not Recommended

First off this game would be great if it weren't for the total incompetence and lack of vision of the developers. There is very little to get you acclimated and the UX/UI is on the level of snapchat in its usability. Guns and attachments are a total mystery with no way to test any of them outside of a live game which if you're lucky enough to find one would give away your position and get you killed immediately if you attempted to target practice. In that vein the beginning of the game can be an exercise in not throwing your computer as the game struggles to load under the weight of what I can only assume is a microwave powering the servers. The mad dash to pick up items as they lag into your inventory while being punch only adds to this exercise.Secondly in a game of 100 people with what seems like little to no way to stop cheating the game loses any chance it could have been to be fun. With 100 people in the game there is a 100% chance you will encounter a cheater and you will more often than not lose.Finally the ability to join different servers around the world seems reasonable until you realize that means playing with people who cannot speak or understand you in a game that requires teamwork.All this being said there is some enjoyment to be had but at the price point I wouldn't recommend this game.,Not Recommended

PUBG used to be a good game I have a bit over 300 hours on it. However since the recent deal with Tencent this game has become so overrun with hackers it is not even playable. I regularly get games where my squads death cams show some hacker standing in the middle of the map hip firing an AK through hills and buildings getting nothing but headshots on targets (often over a kilometer away) as they wipe out everyone single player over the course of a couple minutes.Only about a quarter of pickup squad matches have english speaking players so if you want to play with a squad that can communicate make sure you have friends to queue with.

The result fast paced disorganized chaos of mismanaged gameplay horrible inventory mechanics terrible movement control sluggish shooting and aiming low tick rates and a toxic player base of tryhards going toto be the next Shroud. You'd have to no life this trash to play it long enough to forget how great other games actually are to stomach PUBG truly. 0/10 uninstalled and hidden from my Library. Only wish the remaining people wasting their time in this crap would do the same so the industry would get the hint and move on.,Not Recommended

"There was a time I would have given this game a great review even with the terrible performance and plentiful bugs. That time passed when they ""released"" the game with about 1/3 the content that makes up a game including some locked to being a content creator / pubg partner which is asinine. Now though they've gone full t and replaced most of the cases you can get with locked ones that cost money to buy (this is a full price game not free to play or even cheap) added some t ""event"" that's locked behind a $10 fee and is basically just what you'd expect from a shooter 15 years ago while they're talking about making custom games available to everyone but of course behind a paywall too.This company is awful and no one should give them money.

"Broken game dev's don't care about fixing it. Worthless loot crates ""patches"" only break the game and make it worse.

I really want to like this game but I just cannot support the Developers and their horrible marketing practices. The devs showed their true face early on when they promised not to include loot boxes until it was out of early access and then procceded to add loot boxes before it left early access. This has only further been reinforced be the inflated steam market prices for certain items and the Event pass (which is strangely similar to the battle pass in fortnite). The devs show no interest in fixing the bugs increasingly bad opimization issues random crashes and the increasing number of hackers and would rather sue other companys trying to jump in on the battle royale train.,Not Recommended

I had hoped that upon its release the game will be at least half decent and polished but no every time something gets fixed something entirely else is broken. These days I cant even join the game all I get is an endless loading screen. And when I terminate the game to try to reconnect it happens again. I somehow managed to get over the fact that devs just dont give a and they are taking all the time in the world to fix these things giving us the excuse ""Oh but people dont understand how difficult to fix this or that is these things take time blahblahblah...."".

People either camp like hell until they can ambush someone hack so they can run around killing people from a mile away or scream into their mics nonstop.

Pros+Giant map +Easy to learn +Easy to pick up a quick game and put down+Shutting down a 12yr old screaming the N word coming at you.Cons 100 people in a lobby means 10 15 people screaming into their mics.

This is a really great game when it works. Meaning when it doesnt glitch when you can get into the main menu without having to reset the UI ten times and when you dont get killed by someone using ESP or aimbot hacks. Also whats the point of chosing what region on earth you want to play in when every squad I've ever been a part of involves a bunch of people I cant understand? There needs to be a language lock in the game or something that verifies your IP or where you are from.

So I gave this game alot of time to play and heres what I have to say. First time playing I sucked so bad and had to get used to the gun recoil and placement on close games. I won a few lost a lot but that didn't bother me it was still fun. Now I am writing the review that the devs are lazy barely any new content comes out and the worst part of this game is the chinese hacking community everytime I get killed now in a bizarre fashion its a chinese player. I did a test and this was the results. So I played on the AS servers and NA servers. Latency was not an issue I had more kills and wins on the AS servers because they are literally playing the game as default but when I play on NA servers the kills are so conned that I see what is happening. NA and I am guessing EU which I did not test are flooded by chinese players who want to cheat on other peoples servers. So here is my synopsis if you played at the very beginning you got your moneys worth but if you are playing now or plan on playing it I recommend buying cheats as sad as that is you will be part of the majority as it seems to be mandatory. I never use cheats and if I could I would get my money back now do to the lazyness of devs not attacking hacking sites and protecting there own services.,Not Recommended
Product received for free. Disclaimer I got the game as a birthday gift but was planning on buying it anyway. I absolutely love the game and have played over 100 hours with my friends. The reason for the negative review will be explained below.The game is great no doubt about it. Frequent updates that are actually pretty good for the most part. The developers are doing an amazing job in EA and it is extremely commendable. I cannot however recommend that anyone buy this game. Recently the community managers have been completely unreasonable after some in my opinion bad decisions were made. More information on this can be found on reddit. On top of this there has been a problem recently associated with stream sniping and how it is a BANNABLE offense. Not only should this NOT be a bannable offense it is almost impossible to prove if someone is actually stream sniping. Bluehole's decision to coddle their free advertising (streamers) over the integrity of the community is why I decided that I cannot in good conscience recommend anyone purchase the game. I do not agree with a lot of their official stances on the decisions that they make however if you do then feel free to purchase the game. If your views align with mine do yourself a favor and don't purchase the game.,Not Recommended
"Ive bought this while it was in ""early acces"" had my fun with it... it was best battle royale at the time.It had its problems but it was understandable since it was early acces aid i bought it with that in mind there were weekly small updates and one big monthly update so it was lookin great.Then god knows why they decided to release it out of early acces (but it was probably for marketing and money) and it made the game more broken than before. No more weekly/bi weekly patches not even monthly ones. Now they focus more on adding crates instead of fixing their broken released game. Patches now add nothing just cosmetic changes and most of the time break the game even more. Netcode is bad really bad... to be exact the very worst of all the ""big games"" and fact that asian players play on all other servers but asian just lags the game and servers even more.To sum things up it was good in early acces if you wanted to support it and seen potential but now I wouldnt buy it when I see where its development is going.. just play Fortnite until they make this playable you may even have no need to go to PUBG after that.Pros +one of the better battle royales+fun with friends+big mapsCons broken really bad netcode really bad desync hungry for your money slow development no motivation to win (after you've played it for some time)",Not Recommended

I don't recommend this game until they do something about the hackers. Region lock China. 46% of the player base comes from China yet 99% of the cheaters come from China.

"I have a lot to say about this game. But I'll only say what matters.This game had so much potential to begin with bluehole created a battle royale game with amazing features and unique ideas sparking a whole new generation of gaming being BR games. Over time the community was angered by the game's unoptimisation and premature release which lead to the down fall of the game reinforced by their fierce competition Epic Games' Fortnite. Instead of learning from their mistakes bluehole made some Valve like greedy actions to milk as much $$$ as possible from a game that could revolutionise Battle Royale. Poor optimisation level design gambling and in game purchases completely destroyed this game the way a BBC destroys a white girl. To make matters worse the recent update release was an absolute pi$$take pun intended the event pass priced at 7.49 on top of a sky high overwhelming price of 26.99 is merely a copy of Fortnite's ""Challenge/Reward"" system. On top of this it is a broken mess that doesn't work half the time it costs almost 10 for a 'Season Pass' that lasts 30 days. TLDR Bluehole is greedy don't buy the game not even on sale.",Not Recommended
They released a 10GB update (!!) to improve the health of the game (not adding anything new). The game still lags there is shuttering fps drops and the game almost freezes when entering a new area. This game is great but needs fixing those problems appear even on high end PCs. Cannot recommend it as it is out of early access and it is still such in bad state. You will get tired of those problems after some time playing this game.,Not Recommended
Loved this game. Then people starting shooting me through walls and mountains (wallhecks). Yes mountains. As in the new desert map mountains. Not one of those mountains that you can third person peek over a mountain probably bigger than the state of Texas. I am getting tired of a dude on the back of a dune buggy driving around holding the trigger on a UMP (insult to injury) and the bullets travel through the mountain and nail me in the head. I wasn't even on his mini map for pete's sake. Unless this gets fixed I highly recommend NOT playing this game because it completely ruined game night with my friends and I rarely get the chance to play with mine due to our schedules. I'd tell you not to buy it but at this point you probably already have back when the hype was real. Please fix this developers! I've dumped to much of my life into this game and I get massacred by someone who clearly isn't even North American (with the open mic he runs around with and spews gibberish).

Product received for free. So what a Steam doesn't like bad words game. FPS is bad (had to run the game on very low and barely got 60 fps and I have a 1050ti). It feels heavy to control (I am nit picking this one some people might like it). Too many glitches. Bad servers too many chinese hackers (half joking). I don't recommend buying this game it is way to expensive for what it is. It is like buying a mediocre steak for about R300 (21 dollars). I recommend installing Fortnite. Although its community is cancer it runs much better than this and it is free to play. Fortnite also is a enjoyable game unlike PUGB and the controls are smoother.BUT I do find myself always coming back to this game eventually it is funny and the random encounters with other players is memorable but that doesn't save the game from being trash. I am always up to suggestions and corrections so if you think otherwise please comment and share your opinions.I give PUBG a 2/10,Not Recommended

Then all of a sudden the Asians started invading the servers around mid August in which the game became literally unplayable. Everyone was lagging the servers were not connecting and if you could connect it would disconnect you after 10 15 minutes.

Been playing on and off and can say the game is getting worse.Cheaters are abound I mean people flying up to 5th story roofs report cheater and two games later same person same ending.Getting hit with lag during combat and only combat seem strange since I have have excellennt upload and download speeds and no other issues with high player count gamesBluehole says they care but since they have pocketed so much cash it is becoming obivious that they have forgotton the people who have bought their game.Still waiting for the second map damn should have 3 maps by now and don't say it is in testing etc. This is a Alpha Build we are the testers.People save your money until Bluehole starts producing again which I doubt why should they they are multi millionaires and its time for a vacation in the Swiss Alps.UPDATE Now they are more concern about leaderboards and advertisinfg than fixing the issues. Please think twice before purchasing. Cheaters are now rampant. Since their are no Chinese servers they play on the others causing issues. Today I had a floating player who was getting headshot after headshot with a pistol.At least I purchased early enough to have some fun but now it is cheat fest server lag advertising fiasco.,Not Recommended

Early Access at time of writing.It's OK. It's a DayZ/Arma clone. Doesn't have as many bugs as Dayz. The airdrop start and diminishing game area is a good idea. I mostly play with friends in duo/team matches that's where it gets good it's a bit dull solo and mostly comes down to RNG luck and whether you happen to see someone before they see you.Player movement inventory management and shooting feel quite raw it's clearly EA and feels like it. Fingers crossed all that will get sorted before they start adding more guns because this game doesn't lack guns.IMO currently not at all worth 20+ purchase price. It's a 10 game at best it feels a lot like a mod. I'm not sure it'll ever really be worth more than 10 unless they introduce a significant amount of content in terms of maps vehicles game modes etc. I believe they are planning to do this but obviously it's a gamble. The current game mechanics favour scopes if you're lucky enough to find one you will do much better. It's because the map is very open and there's a lot of time spent running through fields and things with little cover. It's not a bad thing but it can be frustrating if you aren't favcoured by the RNG gods.,Not Recommended
Gameplay wise battlegrounds is an amazing game however the devs have recently went back on what they told the community in the early development stages of the game.They stated that the in game crates/cosmetics will be free and can be earned with the ingame curreny that you aquire from playing the game.This past week bluehole did a complete 180 and announced that the new cosmetics can be obtained by a new type of crate they are intruducing that can be purchased for $2.50 each.This shows that the devs have little respect for the the community and are cashing out.on top of all this their PR is a nightmare and this terrible gambleing style cash grab needs to come to a stop.If you want this game to head in the right direction vote with your wallet and do not purchase the game and if you do.Please do not contribute to the problem do not buy any of these crates.,Not Recommended

"Right now the game is plagued with cheaters 80% of the times I get killed in endgames it's Chinese people with random numerical names that shoot in third person and track you behind cover. The game itself is based almost exclusively on luck the path the plane takes is luck the amount of people you'll encounter when dropping is luck the loot is luck the vehicle spawns is luck the circles... the only thing certain is the fact you'll encounter a cheater in the endgame more than half of the time. When down to 10 players the place the circle randomly decides to close on will almost exclusively determine who wins. And if it closes on you you'll have to pray a Chinese guy with 1000 ping doesn't 1 shot kill you behind cover with a Kar98 on a lvl. 2 helmet you got after looting 20 houses and traversing half the map.The performance is atrocious on a GTX 1060 and a i5 7600 I get constant frame drops and the houses for some reason take a while to load their walls sometimes.You can ""do well"" without doing anything just hiding or you can be experienced with the mechanics of the game and die by a fragger who happened to get a shotgun before you in your same house in the first 2 minutes of a game. You can get to top 1000 of the leaderboards by being awful at the game. But the top 10 is reserved to obviously legit people with 30 games and 300 kills.When you eventually win in your 100th game you'll have a feeling of getting blessed by the gods of randomness as you'll realize half the reason you won is because nobody happened to see your car as you approached the final zone people around you killed between each otherand you happened to see the final enemy in third person while the circle always closed on or near you AND while you happened to have cover.The fact this is the most played game on Steam is baffling. Skill and strategy is left aside in place of chance and randomness. While cheaters continue to profit from selling crates they get from killing 20 people per game.",Not Recommended

Everyone has heard of Fortnite and Call of Duty has a Battle Royale mode now. I can only imagine someone prefering this game because they feel psychologically bound to the skins they spent so much time unlocking for their bad broken game while waiting for better BR games to come out.

I bought this game a month after it was released in Early Access. I came from H1Z1 which I finally abandoned after so many broken promises from a developer (Daybreak) that was clearly incapable of delivering a solid product. I was excited for PUBG the developers promised a clear roadmap with frequently published dev letters (which they did for 2 updates) no monetization until they were out of EA plenty of content updates (again when they were out of EA) focusing on core gameplay fixing bugs improving performance. As I mentioned earlier the detailed dev update letter went away after 2 updates. A few updates later and instead of focusing on performance improvements and bug fixing resources went to add in vaulting. A month later and the first monetization scheme was added in. There were excuses given with every change and many assurances that the performance issues rampant hackers and innumerable bugs were going to be addressed.Well it's July 2018 and these things have all only gotten worse. Server performance is absolutely terrible (it's great for a few days after every new update only to degrade heavily shortly thereafter) hackers are still rampant and stay on the leaderboards for months people from halfway around the globe can connect to local servers in your area and because of the terrible lag compensation and client side hit detection actually have an ADVANTAGE it's pointless using in game money to get crates because most of them require a $2.50 key to unlock and you have no way to choose which one you get the event modes are frustratingly imbalanced and not fun and the list goes on. Bluehole has promised every step of the way to fix the problems but at every juncture they instead implement new ways to take your money. Instead of stable servers we have an event pass that costs $10 set up in such a way that you're almost guaranteed to have to buy level advancements at $5 each to complete all the missions etc.Short version this game is a dumpster fire. Like a dumpster fire it's probably fun watching from a distance but get up close and you're going to have a bad time. This is the second battle royale game Brendan Greene has been creative director of and they both ended up the same way which makes me think this is a feature and not a bug of his games. If you buy this game you might have fun on occasion but the rest of the time you will be frustrated and annoyed. If you like dumping money into a black hole for a few cool skins you'll love it but don't expect it to be anything more than what it is right now Bluehole has made tons of money and they aren't going to change the way they do business. At this point I'm biding my time until a competent and less scummy developer comes out with a battle royale game that's similar enough I can drop this game into the dustbin of history and never look back. I think most others will do the same.,Not Recommended

Over having 300 hours gametime i would give it a positive review because when a game has no hackers its one of the best battle royale game out there.

This game seems pretty fun but i just wish the graphics were not so intensive. Right now I have a mid range gaming laptop with 2 GB nvidia graphics 8gb ram and an i7 processor but I still can barely run this game at its minimum.If you have a beefy computer though you probably will be able to run it and have some fun.That said the map is so large that getting into gunfights is seldom. I have consistently gotten to the top 10 only encountering 1 player. I can never actually get good at the gunfighting portion of the game because I never get into gunfights!! Also gameplay gets repetitve after awhile which is expected its a battle royale type game. Playing with friends however makes up for its repetitveness I racked up a day's worth of play time because I really only played with some friends a few dorms down. It was lots of fun working as a team in that kind of setting but if you're playing alone its not really that fun. I dont really want to like or dislike because it is right in the middle its ok. I bought it for full price as an impulse buy then realized that when I am alone its not really worth it. The summer sale prices the game at 19.99 which is a significantly better price for what you get.,Not Recommended
If you're thinking to buy this I would like to tell you first you should check the specification of your desktop as you need 60 fps at least.

"Game is a month away from release and it's the most broken it's ever been.The optimization is terrible since the game runs like even on good PCs.Servers have been for the past month randomly disconnecting people during games and being laggy as hell you often find people rubberbanding all over the place making it impossible to hit them.The combat is inconsistent as hell especially in close quarters the movement is clunky and so is aiming in general sometimes it feels like I'm controlling a crane rather than a character.Some aspects of the game are completely unbalanced someone that ends up on a favorable position and with a lot of healing items is virtually immortal if he doesn't take risks he can just pop out get hit 2 or 3 times retreat to heal up and do it over and over again. Most of the time it just becomes a game of who has the most First aid kits unless someone gets a headshot with a sniper rifle fights can go on for AGES combine this with the random combat and you get a glorified version of rock paper scissors.I have to admit that when the game decides to work it's actually pretty good especially with friends and as far as ""battle royale"" games go this is still the best one hands down just don't go in expecting a balanced or skill based experience the game is mostly based on luck so it can sometimes be very frustrating.All in all this early access experience it's been mostly negative I've been playing for a few months now and it really feels like the devs haven't made any real progress on a lot of aspect they promised they would have improved over time the game still runs like the game is still infested with bugs and glitches the servers are still laggy as hell and cheating is becoming a huge problem. Patches get released very rarely lately they used to be almost on a weekly basis and they actually tried to address some of the problems the game had but now they get released maybe once a month and they fix some very minor PUBG is a game I really enjoy playing I also think that it has a lot of potential to become a GOOD game right now it might even be the most played on steam but it's still pretty bad devs said they were focusing on fixing the game rather than adding content but right now we have neither I seriously hope that 1.0 is actually a playable game but I wouldn't keep my hopes up.",Not Recommended

Giving a thumbs down until the hacking issue is fixed. I dearly love this game but I am sick of encountering a hacker in almost every lobby I go into. Whether its getting shot through walls or being seen through walls im sick of it. Devs please get your together id rather have a playable game that I dearly love then a new map and new vehicles.Edit I find it kind of sad how the beta had less bugs than pc launch 1.0. Whether its connection issues constant resets of lobbies or the fact that the game seems to constantly be bugging in one way or another its just sad. I do love this game as i find it uniqque in a very good way I just wish the devs would make the game work better instead of releasing new content when there are more important issues at hand regarding the games welfare.,Not Recommended

"a flawed game. its 2 biggest problems Horribly optimized unless you have monster PC you won't have a smooth experience. Number 2 its filled with cheaters. Sometimes its obvious but other times you'll be wondering ""was that guy cheating maybe?"". The core gameplay is subjective. If you like Last Man Standing kind of games you wont hate it but the game has this initial investment period of every match. You drop in and spend 5 15 minutes looking for decent loot. Its mundane and repetitive and since gear isnt persistent you must do it every time. So once you've found some decent gear you're ready to actually play the game. In most cases you'll die so fast that all your cool gear won't matter and will just get looted by another player. Then you start all over again. minor problems directional audio needs work. You'll have difficulty knowing where shots are coming from. no directional hit locators. as above you'll struggle to figure out where shots are coming from. You'll die often as a result never knowing or seeing who got you. git gud f ggit. Lobby has many bugs. freezing not showing correct status of teammates etc. game is already selling out to in game ads. You'll see them on buildings. an early access game with microtransactions in game ads and a $30 price tag on top. neat huh?

I have spent more then 500 hours in this game i bought it almost immediatelly after it has gone out so it means in early access and all i can say is that this game has so many irregularities that should not have been here after so much cash that they earned. I decided to wait and wait and wait but all they can fix i guess is ing breathing animation and I am sick of this. I really like the concept of this game and practically new genre that this game created but i feel like developers are not working as hard as they should. first of all so many bugs and second I feel like weapons and hit points they take and how they react on armor and helmet are a total t on paper everything looks fine but in game everything is mixed and the only thing that you can be sure is that you will not die if you don't get hit by anything and that is a damn shame. So if you want to rage from time time this is the game you WANT to buy. And after so much time i still want this game to succeed and fix so many of the big bugs and things that needs to be fixed so that we can all enjoy game that we payed for but... This will probably not happen. They are not listening for community and it will be their end. It is probably another case that we saw where some game company pulled big money on it and bailed after some time.I will continue playing this game probably and still hope for the best beacuse this game has great potential but i need a longer pause starting today.Ty for reading and hope that you see my words are true after you spend some time in this game,Not Recommended
Where to start with what's wrong with this game is the real question. They pushed for a christmas release and really this game is still in beta as far as I'm concerned. My number 1 issue with the game above is actual simple playability. Look at this forum and videos attached for what I'm about to describe https //forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/42649 being shot freezes game/No matter what your hardware is no matter what settings you play on THIS WILL happen to you. You will get a screen freeze every time you are shot at or begin shooting at someone in close quarters. Sniper rounds seem to not affect this but this alone is gamebreaking. I run a i7 980GTX TI in SLI setup with 32gb of ram and play the game on the lowest settings across the board and still get this screen freeze issue. This is the number 1 complained about issue currently maybe next to the zenophobia that seems to plague american's complaining about people speaking another language in their games.Onto issue 2 It's a world based game where we can play with anyone in the world and they can play with us. American's don't seem to get into games like this that often and it's honestly ridiculous how much I have to listen to 'explitive explitive explitive china explitive' in literally every single game queue without fail. In reality the chinese player base is very friendly even the cheaters are pretty cool guys it's super rare to run into a toxic chinese player yet you're not ever gonna find a PUBG lobby that doesn't have some american yelling to region lock china and send them back where they belong which is bs.Issue 3 The cheating in this game is absolutely abhorrent and going unchecked.https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 3hMi8thYaj0https //www.giantbomb.com/forums/playerunknowns battlegrounds 729798/pubg cheating is out of control 1817982/Multiple examples here in the above mentioned links and this is in every game. It's not 'rare' at all it's such a commonplace practice at this point that even MMOwnedCore has links for free aimbots to xray mods. The just of it all is that aimbots are everywhere less common is the xray hack which allows people to see an outline of you through buildings wherever you are at all times so they can always know what you're doing/where you're going etc. There's wall hacking mods where people can jump/run/shoot through walls without issue my favorite I've ever seen though is a mod where it turned player models into skyscrapers. Literal skyscrapers. Imagine 100 skyscrapers just running around a huge open map. You shoot at the top of the building and it counts as a headshot no matter where the player was on the map absolutely insane. Bluehole keeps saying they're combatting hacking/cheating/banning people but imo they're really not. We saw a January release of them attacking hackers the community now believes it was nothing but a large scale banwave as people went to test old mods and they still work without issue ownedcore and reddit have confirmed a very large list of mods/hacks after the january 'patch' that haven't been affected in the slightest.Issue 3 Great game design. Horrible community by and large. Horrendous publishing company that already had a bad rap from Tera the MMO. The worst thing that they're doing and it is widely accepted to be true at the moment is datamining/bitcoing mining off your machine from the login screen. Watch your afterburner when you're at the launch screen for PUBG and you will see 90 99% GPU usage no matter what your setup is. You get in game and like me with my GTX 980 TI everything at low settings it instantly drops to 30% or lower. It's a disgusting practice don't take my word for it though there's a plethora of complaints about it online across multiple forums. The worst part however is they're using something called XIGNCODE which looks at all files you've accessed in the last 48 hours and scans keylogs. It's an atrociously invasive game that goes beyond even Facebook's data mining practices.https //forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/104174 sitting in main menu pubg is eating 99 of my gpu 970/In conclusion. Please do not hand this publisher anymore money. Please do not play this game as it's got a fun value that lasts about 40 60 hours after you're 'used' to the game mechanics and you start making it into the final 10 20 consistently only to realize you're not cheating so the chances of you winning are already slimmer than they should be.,Not Recommended

PUBG is one of my favourite games of all time for about 10 months it was an absolute blast to play.But unfortunately the developers are probably the most incompetant I've ever encountered in 20+ years of gaming and this is saying a lot in a world with Activision Blizzard and EA.No OCE (AU/NZ) support at all for the last 8 months is incredibly disappointing and there is no sign of it improving at all.,Not Recommended

Do not buy this game if you want to win or have a competitive experience. The Oceanic servers are riddled with hackers from Asia (mostly) and the game is still buggy and needs improvement. It can however be an enjoyable experience if played with friends and doing fun challenges like pistols only etc. The loot system is also an incredibly irritating part of the game at times and if you do not like games that require luck then this game is not for you. You may drop in a city and loot 5+ houses and get nothing but a pistol whereas your opponents may visit 1 2 houses and get an AKM + armour and instantly destroy you.Overall the game needs a massive improvement and focus needs to be put into the game's inadequate servers optimisation and cheaters.

Just for visualization You could afford 11 fkin falcon 9 rockets with that money and still would have 10 mil left for I dont know icecream. Now keep visualizing this 11 falcon 9 rockets. How in Elon Musks name can it be that almost a year after release of the game still the same bugs do occur as in early Beta? I give you some examples You stand there open handed because your weapon just vaporized you are inbetween a houseroof (yes this is somehow possible) the lobby wont load you are not able to join the game even though your buddies already are midflight and of course the holy grail of all bugs the random shutdowns of PUBG (yes they occur about every third to fourth game or so sometimes rarer sometimes more often).But hey I totally understand the priority list of the developpers. I mean like how could a kid play this game without the ability to spend his fathers/mothers hard earned money for a fkin pink Mp9.... Of course Bluehole is like that one fat kid that demands double the food because the other guy that doesnt get food at home gets an extra apple from the cafeteria lady out of mercy Fortnite is free to play what is your excuse PUBG?The genre has great potential but you know what hurts me the most is not that i dont ennjoy the game as much as I wished but that I had great hopes in the future PUBG from early Beta on but this wishes never got fulfilled and therefore the game at its state now is a dissappointment and I dont expect it to get better.Peace out kiss on the glans and cheerioyour slightly angry former PUBG player,Not Recommended

So..When it released I couldn't play this game stably. Running at around 20 frames constantly and in most cases I couldn't even boot up the game in the first place. Now? It actually runs pretty well on my computer. I'm glad a game like PUBG has actually taken its time to update their game because quite a lot of studios I find don't update anything for their games. Although I have tried it out again and to be completely honest it's fun with friends but only with friends.Then again I'm the type of person that just does not like battle royal games. I bought this game initially because I was interested in the play and since my friends were wanting to get into it that I may as well give it a go. Although when I did infact buy it I met with problems prior to (around) its release and I couldn't redeem a refund. That's why I still have the game and the hours.Do I recommend it for its price?

I ve had so much fun on this game until...So I decided to play in Asian servers since the American ones were down until further notice. I played a couple rounds no hassle until my game crashed. I reopened it and there were two unclose able ads on the lobby page making the game unplayable. I couldn t click on anything. I uninstalled and reinstalled to find it still there and nothing I ve tried has gotten the ads away. I haven t played pubg in 2 weeks due to this and it better get fixed soon.,Not Recommended

A friend of mine offered me this game and tbh this looks like battlefront II you find someone you shoot and thats it youre dead simple as that. People said that this is somewhat a skilled based game me and some of my friends beg the differ. This game can be very frustrating most of the times you land you try to get some weapon and the game just lags no its not my IP service these servers are just damn awfull tbh honest I dont recomend this game if you plan to go solo all the way if you can bring some good friends and create a squad I would say a very harsh perhaps. Play this at your own patience and risk.,Not Recommended

"The concept is good. The execution is absolutely dreadful.So by now I'm sure you've read a lot of reviews on the optimization hackers crashing etc. Well I'm going to go a little more in depth than surface issues like that. The things I will bring up certainly will fall within one of those categories but will be in an attempt to highlight a much larger issue.#1 HackersThe thing that frustrates me the most in this game is that the players at the end are always blatant hackers. Now digging a bit deeper the larger issue here is Bluehole's complete and utter apathy toward the situation. In fact there's a lot of speculation in the community that they are purposely not banning extremely obvious hackers due to the fact that it is actually an integral part of certain Asian economies. Yes hackers are encouraged by the developers because by the time they get banned they've often sold cosmetics for $700+. A ban means nothing to them. The developers will literally let people with a 90% win rate 100% top 10 rate and 50 1 KDA sit at the top of the leaderboard all season. That's how blatantly obvious it is. This is not hyperbole what I'm saying is a literal scenario from last season.To put this into perspective these buffoons don't even encrypt their packets. This allows script kiddies to hack undetected with ease running a program on another computer.#2 DesyncComing in second (it was close) is certainly the desynchronization (desync) issue. Hit detection is client side. Most things in this god awful game are client side. Therefor it's EXTREMELY common for someone to use a lag switch switch it on before popping out from cover light up their enemy then switch it back off. Bingo insta kill to the innocent person who's waiting for the person to peak from around corners yet never does. They only end up dying never seeing the person peek yet on the death cam it shows them carefully slowly peak around and take their time firing. Sure I know what you may be thinking ""I'm sure not everyone uses lag switches"". You're right and in fact that was my initial thought on the desync issue. HOWEVER and this is the main point here Asians hop over to the NA servers because they know their ping will be higher (which is a HUGE advantage with client side hit detection) and people with normally decent connections will start massive downloads before starting their PUBG match. This allows them to have a 1+ second advantage on everyone else. This is so incredibly common that I dare wager around 40% of the people I come across are desync'd. It's blatantly obvious when you pepper someone see blood poof 5 8 times and on the death cam you never even hit them once.#3 Physics and Physics Related GlitchesThird is the infuriatingly horrendous physics and the bugs caused by them. Want an example? Sure go to YouTube and search for ""PUBG Glitch"". There you go. Motorcycles bumping into cars cause the cars to fling into outer space at a few million miles per hour while flipping at an equally absurd rate. Tiny pebbles cause vehicles in general to either completely stop (and damage the hell out of you) or react in some absolutely ridiculous way. Now I again have a feeling I might know what you're thinking. I used to think ""well that's not too bad everyone puts up with it and it's a bit funny"". Sure you're right if you're thinking that. Here's my gripe however. Whether you're getting down to the top 10 to die to a vehicle malfunction or dying within the first 30 seconds of landing (yeah sometimes when dropping you take random amounts of damage for literally no reason at all sometimes it's 90% of your health and one punch will finish you off) it eventually gets absolutely infuriating. Having it happen the first 100 times is admittedly fairly funny. However beyond that it gets incredibly old to be so powerless over your fate. We're playing a competitive video game clearly it's not unreasonable to assume that someone playing this game would want to die to someone else's skill someone else's luck or their own shortcomings. Dying to poorly programmed BS is not fun.#3.5 Physics and Teamkilling Your FriendsPart three and a half still falls into the physics but it's a bit different. You will team kill your friends all the damn time with vehicles it's just the way this stupid game wants things to happen. I had a buddy jump onto my jet ski and insta die. No I was not moving. I couldn't even revive him because it literally insta killed him (not a down). You learn to adapt to these kinds of things and make sure you're playing EXTREMELY carefully in regards to vehicles but imagine that during a firefight. If you're more concerned by the vehicle accidentally TAPPING (and insta killing) your team mates than you are the 4 enemies firing at you there's a MAJOR flaw in the game. You are playing against the poor programming 95% of the time in this game and playing against other players about 5% of the time. That's the TRUE experience of this game fighting flaws in an attempt to actually eventually fight players.#4 LootFourth is most definitely the loot system. My god RNG is just the stupidest thing (and laziest) that developers could possibly do. Yes it works for dungeon crawlers. No it doesn't work for an FPS be it Battle Royale or otherwise. When will developers finally learn this? The fact that you can drop down and search through 5+ buildings and still not have a weapon is just pathetic. Yes that happens. I mean there are videos of streamers all over the place showcasing exactly that running from building to building not finding anything worthwhile. Meanwhile some lucky punk picks up a shotty and kills you. Sure having that happen now and then is not terrible and is part of the game. However when there are so many hackers who literally have a weapon before you gain control of your character (when dropping some people make it to the ground 100x faster than you do somehow and also never have the 2 3 second period where you're ""getting up"" after landing and unable to control your character) you are powerless. You can do nothing but watch as they aim on your head before you've even seen a single weapon. This happens every game. Every. Single. Game. The hackers know exactly where to go to get the weapons you will never beat them to a good weapon while playing honestly. All you can do is go to sub par areas and cross your fingers for loot.The Real Issue The DevelopersI'm sure by now you've noticed a trend. Pretty much everything I've mentioned here is essentially a gripe that the developers are well terrible. They are. I firmly believe that Bluehole consists of monkeys which they give different psychoactive drugs and put a keyboard in front of them. At least that's the quality of the product they produce. They're rookies without a clue and their interactions with their customers make it blatantly obvious that they're also condescending self righteous hats with a chip on their shoulder. I'm fine supporting a rookie company who treats their fans well. However supporting a pile of garbage with pompous jackasses behind it is asinine and unreasonable. I'd never recommend this game to anyone. Dr. Disrespect sums it up all the time with his many many rants. The developers are trash. The game is trash. It never gets better. To top it off they're more concerned with cosmetics and offering up rewards to the hackers than fixing any sort of legitimate bugs.Steer clear. Seriously. You will regret putting any time at all into this game.P.S. I made it to top 200 in NA my first season playing if that tells you anything about my level of familiarity with FPSes and my skill. None of my rant is based on getting roflstomped and simply assuming I'm being killed by script kiddies.",Not Recommended

The game is 100% ruined by hackers for the time being and also by the developers unwillingness to do anything that would actually prevent cheating. PUBG has become near unplayable due to 90% of games ending with chinese hackers instantly killing half of the server or using a drop kick hack to kick everyone out of the game making player count go from 100 to 30 within 3 minutes of the game starting by killing them while they are disconnected. If you are lucky enough to land far away from a hacker it just means you will loot for 15 20 minutes until your whole squad dies instantly without any chance to fire a shot making every match tedious at best.With the developers refusing to ban more often cheaters are actually making money by killing mass amounts of players for points and using them to get crates and then selling those crates offloading money onto different steam accounts before the next banwaves.,Not Recommended
"Product received for free. A friend gifted me the game and I tried to play it but kept getting an initialization error with Steam. Interesting thing is my friend had the same issues too but they got miraculously resolved (like everyone else that's been asking for help on forums). After having this game installed for over an hour and accumulating 15 minutes in the game JUST by sitting at the loading/error screen I've decided it's really not worth trying to play. The even better part is that half the users that ask for the solution to this problem never get it fixed but if they do they just restarted Steam and BAM! It's working! By the way the other half that were listening and trying to come up with solutions still didn't find a fix. Not even the big yellow ""Cancel"" button at the error screen does anything.I've accumulated 15 minutes in the game by spending almost an hour doing the following Restarting the game and Steam testing the same 5 solutions repeated all over Reddit and Steam even re installing and trying to play on the test server sharing with a different account and using it from there disabling my antivirus disabling my firewall using a VPN running Steam in admin mode running the game in admin mode without steam restarting my PC and verifying the game files.Too long didn't read The game is so buggy that only half the users who have the same issue as me get it fixed and it happens magically out of nowhere. I've tried most everything there is to try and that didn't work.ICING ON THE CAKEI went to submit a report ticket because I should probably be nicer and tap the devs on the shoulder by saying that the game is broken for half of their users and it tells me to register an account. Fine. I try to register and I get a server error. I literally couldn't fix the original issue find a fix that was working for more than half the victims of it or send a report ticket about the issue.My official rating 1.3/6 because I can only judge the game by what I've heard and what I've heard is fairly bad optimization for the majority of high end users and (from personal experience) bugs that literally prevent you from reaching the main menu of the game.",Not Recommended

I killed a lot of people from back while they were sniping other people I even trolled them a lot in the game stayed behind them waited so that they see me and boom! a kar98 shot from 2 meterwhat do I mean by this? we have plenty of good shooters and survival games that you can play battleroyale is just a marketing game. right now game industry is trying to earn more money from the online and competitive games and that changes the shape of video games ( i don't say we don't have good single players no . I'm saying that tables have been turned ). TL DR game optimization have problems devs are fixing alot but the game core is a problem ( they gave updates 15 times more than the games original size ) gameplay has flaws so much randomness that it can't even give a good experience there are a lot of better games out there its a big marketing trick the breeding between genres just doesn't go well their genes just don't match no point at the end brings addiction",Not Recommended

Do not play this game. They have made it to make money disrequarding quality.Fps used to be about skill and gaming with your friends. Pub has on that allowing cheaters to infest every single game on your map you spawn on.Would you like to play against someone from asia and have your bullet not count because their ping is such that you get shot in your head after three of your rounds did not count? play PUBGThe maps are horrible. The loot system is horrible. They are the pioneer of the iest game I have ever played.DoctorDisrespect should get all of the money for pub because he made that game what it is even though he complained constantly about their lack of ability to make a game.Pub g has the worst people behind this game... they made this and then once they started making money they cut the out of the office and banged some man boys and did cocaine untill their little mushrooms swelled up like new sponge in water.I bet you 5 bucks my review will be removed by steam because they are a bunch of cash grabbing suckers just like blue hole.My freedom of speach doesn't count in this t forum of sucker game developers who dont even need to finish a game combined with a group of hippie coffee sipping little es from steam who pay people to double check bad review of their ass titles they ride the wave on.they are the new EAEa sucks like you would not believe and so does steam and the reason for this is us.we are to blame for these games.why do we open crates for some t chothes that people would only wear in japan?you wear a leather hoodie in America guess what happens moron.do not play this game it is the worst game ever. the whole model is based on making money and it has failed.I can not stress this enough do not download this game I have deleted it and I am never coming back.FYI I have been gaming before steam existed so let me drop my nuttz right on blueholes chin and steam can suck my taint,Not Recommended

"Any positive summary of this game is entirely offset by the overwhelming number of cheaters.To date I've logged approximately 800 hours between the live and test servers. Cheating has never been as rampant as it has been since the weeks shortly before PC launch and every day since. It's clear that BattlEye is not the answer yet Bluehole refuses to acknowledge as much and instead demands that the community police itself by submitting reports to what is undoubtedly a severely backlogged tracker.BattlEye reported 50k accounts were banned for cheating in August 2017. That number increased by 500% to 300k in October. A mere month later that number more than doubled to 700k. As of December 2017 1.5 MILLION accounts have been banned for cheating. At the current rate we can expect BattlEye to report 3.5 million or more bans by the end of January 2018.I'm not going to mince words China is a huge part of this issue. Bluehole has taken the politically correct approach to combating the cheating and their ""creative director"" Brendan Greene has gone so far as to call out the PUBG community for demanding better results namely by way of a region lock. Given that Chinese players comprise an estimated 60 65% of the PUBG community it's no surprise that Greene and Bluehole are ignoring public outcry about the cheating in an effort to protect the player totals they so frequently enjoy boasting about on social media. Despite the rapidly declining quality of this product their interest remains with numbers and sales.Make no mistake PUBG is a fascinating game and wildly addicting. My squad and I have persevered and continue playing but the reality is tolerating the ever increasing cheaters is draining both mentally and physically. I can't speak to what the future holds for PUBG but I can say with absolute certainty that much like thousands if not millions of other players we too are contemplating calling it a career on PUBG.Greene is a fool and Bluehole is in way over their heads that's the harsh reality. Until this community becomes more vocal with their discontent beyond what you see on /r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS where moderators censor most of the unrest this game will trudge along and become a revolving door of players until ultimately it's a Chinese only product.It's really quite unfortunate because as I opened with there are a lot of good things about this game but ineffective anti cheat naive developers a pandering ""creative director"" and China entirely overshadow those positives. In good conscience I cannot recommend this game to anyone who has an interest in investing a significant amount of time into this game certainly not for a $30 USD price tag.",Not Recommended
Terrible game unless you like hacking bugs and a developer who wants to fist its player base with crates instead of fixing the game.,Not Recommended
I love this game and it's very addictive I agree that PUBG is one of the best FPS game and would strongly recommend people to buy the game but due to hackers and the lack of effective solution from developers I'm very disappointed. Developers said they had put in the work to prevent hackers but I havn't see things change. The numbers of hacker just increases and when we report we don't even get feedback on that player what so ever. As now I don't think money is the problem for them I just want to ask them did they tried their best to prevent hacking? Or they just want to get more money? I don't know the answer and I wouldn't know at the end of the day but I don't want this game to die just because developers don't get their hands on the hackers. I love the idea and perspective of the game but the hacking thing must change!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO SOMETHING PLEASE !! DO SOMETHING PLEASE !! DO SOMETHING PLEASE !! DO SOMETHING PLEASE !!

PUBG is a battle royale shooter. That's what it is nothing more nothing less.It can be fun but what makes me not like it is a couple of things just from a starting standpoint. High Latency the ping problem in this game is horrible. Every game i've entered my ping was always over 100ms never really stabilizing my internet was absolutely fine at this time. Unoptimization There are times where the game decides to dip below 50 on lowest settings on my GTX 1060 and i7 6700k and the game consistently appears choppy making the all around experience of PUBGs nitty gritty atnosphere unejoyable to say the least. PUBGs Difficulty for some people this could definitely be a plus but in my eyes i don't see it as much as a 'fun' difficult like CSGO where learning it is fun and rewarding PUBG from the get go is very hard having you measure and calculate bullet drop based on meter distance with your map difficult to learn gunplay. Compared to it's competitors (Fortnite Blackout ROE) PUBG was just very hard to pick up and get used to for me but like i said before this isn't exactly a negative this is just a warning to people not into games with immense learning curves.,Not Recommended

I honestly am surprised that this game had so much time in alpha and beta and still is a huge dumpster fire. Cheaters are not as big of an issue as I was expecting from the gameplay and reviews I had previously watched and read so good job on fixing that. Physics on vehicles that magically hit something when there is NOTHING THERE is just plain sad. Climbing over ledges railings etc. is hit or miss at the most inconveniant of times. Hit detection is abysmal. Having controller compatability but not allowing players using a controller to view death cams or report cheaters is yet another issue that shouldn't exist with how much time this game was in alpha/beta what did you just never have anyone test what happened after you die on controller? Last but not least... loot boxes (Player Unknown's casino) so you can get loot boxes for free but you get throttled through the week with having each loot box cost twice as much each time you get a random loot box and of those random loot boxes you can get ones that require keys to open (which cost money) good job forcing some players to pay for items that we all will admit look like crap unless you have God (or whatever deity you believe in) on your side giving you a cosmetic that you can sell for almost a grand (but loot boxes aren't gambling just like pacheenko parlors(sarcasm)).

"To be honest this game started out fun and a great game to come home and play with friends on. This game partially made my summertime extremely fun and gave me and my friends a game to play. However after playing the game for hours on end each night you begin to realize how deep down this game is torn unstable and downright deteriorated on the inside. It's like that one fellow in your class who sits in class with a great gaping smile but deep down is filled with hurt and pain that is gasping to come out. Many of the issues I can describe are what many others have already stated terrible optimization (which they've been working on well done) client side kills issues with cheaters et cetera. However I believe this game outlines a greater problem I see with many newer early access titles today sure you purchased this game in ""early access"" and I know there will be that one guy who states""oh you dont know what early access means do you..."" but you see that's the whole issue allowing games to be broken to the point of frustration and unplayability but just brushing that to the side because it's ""in early access."" This similarly happened to Ark Survival Evolved as well where it was insanely fun to play with friends when it came out first in early access. However allowing your games to be this terrible just because it's an early access title completely spoils what could have been potentially an extremely fun game in the long run. It's like cooking someone a gourmet dish that all of the critics rave about but instead of giving you the final completed meal they give you 6 servings of the dish that were over cooked over seasoned dropped on the floor and accidently cooked with tainted meat. Sure the final dish is phenomenal but because you gave them a bad taste in their mouth of what this ""dish"" could have been they don't want to stay to eat the finished meal. They probably would have stormed out of the restaurant and filed a complaint with the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service. The point is I'm sure this game can go far in terms of replayability graphics and overall fun factor. But the fact that all of the fun that my friends and I have had was soiled with many of the ""early access"" issues is just upsetting especially seeing how much the game has changed. To be honest I'd rather would have waited for a few years and gotten the game in early access when these issues werent present at all then to have bought the game now and not be able to complain how terrible the game is because it's in ""early access."" If you haven't bought this game buy at your own risk. Fortnite is free runs better is more vibrant in terms of colors and is quite a fun game in my opinion I recommend checking that out. Also I do not have anything against the company and this review isn't to spread general hate and is simply outlining not only my honest opinion on the game but also what I think is to be a severe issue with the early access program.TL DR? The game was fun but the issues made it not fun. I don't want to hear a ""it's in early access don't complain"" because that arguement proves nothing. Early access has become a place of ""here's a terribly constructed game play it if you have any issues... it's in early access )"" If you take this review to heart my apologies but someone's gotta say it.",Not Recommended

Product received for free. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this game intitally but it just gets so repetitive and stale. The first 20 matches or so are so exhilerating and action packed that they feel like you've been brought right into the game. But eventually the same thing happens every match. Unless you intentionally do stupid and unique stuff the matches essentially boil down into win or die trying. The graphics are quite nice and pleasing to the eye. The game honestly has little content and you can get very bored if you don't like repetition. So if you love shooters and general predictable gameplay this game is for you.

A game with amazing potential ruined by the most mediocre and money hungry dev team in the industry....The community has been asking for optimization improved anti cheat system better servers desync hitreg fix since day one while what we get with every update is worse optimization more hackers crates skins useless in game features etc...No wonder they have already lost 2/3rd of their playerbase..And the remaining players will ditch the game soon as there is a better BR game made by a professional dev team who can actually fulfill their players demands for the money and support they get...Eagerly waiting for that day to come.,Not Recommended

This game is so boring that it is actually painful land in one spot that actually has decent loot loot for 10 min walk around for 20 min until you see any enemy get killed by some t.I hate this game because to me atleast it just isnt fun to get a kill in the game in most battle royale games I feel accomplished when I actually kill someone but when I do it in this game it doesnt feel the same. Also the game feels horribly clunky like it was made in 2005 it is horribly optimized and it is filled with glitches,Not Recommended

The game is fun for a bit but the moment you get past the initial tier of noobs and just bad players you can expect some death cams that leave you scratching your head. People who seem to just snap to your head or track you through solid objects. On top of that the dev refuses to adress the issue calling anyone who brings up the fact most of the cheaters and not to mention the horrible ping abusers come from china he writes of the detractors as xenophobes all the while throwing in new lootboxes that require paid keys. Outside the game player unknown has his head so far up his own that hes suing games for being in the same genra as PUBG. Lets hope the studio finally sobers up from sniffing its own farts and gets its $it together or this game is going to be dead soon. This dev has zero respect for the community that brought their game up and only contempt for any other devs in a genra that pubg riped off and popularized. Stay Clear.Update 11/19/2018 Still a broken mess with even more monitization stay away.,Not Recommended
So first of all i bought this game because i tought it would grow and become something better but it seems i wasted my money because the cheaters are still there the bugs are still there. So im putting up with this game because this is what it is plus that its 60 if you dont get it on a discount and all of the sudden i get banned like wtf the cheaters dont get banned and A LOT of honest players do. Im giving up sorry i dont think im gonna play this game again im my life.

In my 42 hours of this game I haven't been able to figure out if I liked it or not. I haven't had any server problems as most people in the reviews. However I personally think that the game is too unfinished to enjoy as of now. It's not even in early access anymore but there is a MINIMUM of visible changes from early access to full release. I'm surprised they call this game a full release. It has lots and lots of potential. It really does. But it's just still not nearly finished to enjoy fully. I truly do hope it gets better in the following years.,Not Recommended

Great Game with Great Issues I greatly enjoy this game I have invested nearly a hundred hours into the game doing either solo or squad with firends and streamers. I enjoy the level of competative edge you need to win the game and the tacitcal prowess that is needed for higher levels of play. But sadly the issues in the game are beginning to out weigh the positives. What I have noticed is that people are making excuses for PBUG due to it being an early access game which has some logic and reasoning behind it. Yet those excuses are starting to seem less and less creditable as the game ages. I have never encountered any obvious hackers but I have noticed that they have become and issue just like in any other game. Be that as it may BlueHole has hessitated in taking any action to stop the hackers or made any public statements that can reassure the community as far as I am concerned. But my biggest issue is with the lack of optimization. Again the game is early access but that is not an excuse for a game that has grown in popularity like PUBG has. I believe that BlueHole needs to take the steps to better optimize their game so that for us who do not have water cooled CPUs can have a chance at playing. But the other big issue that I have encountered is the inconsistency in the geometry. We have all seen streamers use the geometry to leap out of windows and into windows we have also seen players get their vehicles stuck and explode. Last night the night before I wrote this I was playing and found myself stuck on a fence. The fences that are open about a quarter of the way in places like the military base and around power lines in the game. I was stuck there and died outside of the playzone. Those are the inconsistencies that need to be fixed. Just to touch on the subject of getting hit by your moving car if you jump out I somewhat like that feature it could be changed a little to either damage you not kill you or kill you if you jump out wrong. All in all the consept of the game is nice and the gameplay is fun aside from what is above and the joy of winning has yet to get stale. The review is negative due to the issues and BlueHole not taking affermative action on these issues. Yet I will continue to play the game from time to time perhaps just not as religiously as I once did.Thank you. UPDATE The lastest patch did some very nice opitmization to the game.,Not Recommended

Save your money if you're thinking about buying this. There's no fixing the issues this game is facing. They're to big and to wide spread. The hacking is so bad it makes the game unplayable. The net code issues is just as bad. When you play 10 games and 8 of them are ruined by one of these 2 issues you konw it's time to move on and find something else to play. I have a lot of hours in this game toughed out a lot of stuff because I believed stuff would be fixed after 500 hours and not one thing has been fixed and the problems getting progressivly worse by the day im done. Save your money pick up fortnite or wait for the first triple A studio to come out with something like this. This team either doesn't care anymore or is just lazy and both aren't acceptable..

Played this game since a few weeks into the Early Access on Steam last year. It was buggy then improved then buggy then better then buggy better etc etc etcShould have stayed Early Access instead of rushing to meet 2017 release goal. It's not done as far as Anti cheat and Ping lock tech is concerned. If I can't play with my buddies and I want some Squads I have the delight of playing with 3 Cantoneese speakers. I always wonder after my first game if I forgot to set my server to NA but sadly I didn't. PROS If they lock down cheating then you'll be a grizzled vet playing an actual fair game You could get the motivation to learn a foreign language if you get the fantasy of playing on online multiplayer game in which you can interact with others.

pubg has an identity crisis. it's in uncanny valley. the realism is a joke and only hinders the game. this is why fortnite sees a large success. the arcade aspects suck because the mechanics aren't tight and the hit boxes are trash. if counterstrike couldn't fix their hit detection issues with HITSCAN weapons in a 5v5 to 10v10 matches then why on earth do you think some nobodies would be able to do it with 100 players in a single match?,Not Recommended

I have a ton of time on this game and honestly it seems to only get worse as time goes on. The ping is awful the lag is awful and the mechanics are unique but somehow still . The inconsistency is unbearable. It seems as if one needs FAR above average skill to compensate for the iness of this game and after probably close to 1000 hours I'm done. Not because I want to play a new game or am choosing to move on but simply because the game is forcing me to. No other game that I've put this much time into has left me feeling as let down as bad as Pubg has. I thought it would get better with time. I was wrong. IMO they should have sold off the game to a AAA company for 200m and called it a day. Instead they're trying to milk as much money out of this laggy POS game as possible. Its just sad.,Not Recommended

Loved this game since Early Access however I can't implore you enough. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU LIVE IN OCEANIA30 minute+ wait time for matches for many matchmaking queues some are shorter but still 10 15 minutes.

"Would not recommend this game. After playing this game for many hours since its release I can honestly say there are more negatives than positives to this game. To start the game mechanics have been broken and not improved on almost EVER. The vehicle mechanics are horrible nothing worse on this game than being fully geared moving through a field on a bike just to have it tip forward and kill both the driver and passenger. Wait times have gone up lately when joining games and sometimes you cannot even launch the game because ""Servers are too busy"". There are some good features of this game playing with friends is enjoyable for about 3 games then you just want to uninstall and refund. Many custom modes like Zombies War etc are not able to be played unless you get lucky when a lobby is not full but even once it is full good luck joining it as it never starts. Overall the game is something you may have fun with once you start but do not expect to be putting a thousand hours into this as playing it for more than an hour a day will result in some broken screens. Steer from this game and head to fornite I know the graphics and game style is worse with Fornite but consideirng this game charges 40$ and is worse than some free games it shows.",Not Recommended

I would recommend this game but after some extensive play it is just getting way too repetitive. There is absolutley no objective to this game what so ever and the only thing it really has going for it is that its better than H1Z1. Yes the graphics are good and it can be fun at times but over the course of time youll just realize how buggy it is because its still early access and after wasting a good 30 minutes per match for no point youll soon realize that there truly is no point to this game than to come in first no ranks or unlockables besides some rewards packs. Maybe when they fix certain aspects of the game such as loot and server lag then I will most likely recommend the game. But until then I just cannot bring myself to play this game on a daily basis.UPDATE STILL F*****G TRASH! HOW IS IT THAT YOU SELL OVER 4 MILLION COPIES OF A GAME AND STILL CANT EVEN FIX THE SIMPLEST THINGS IN THE GAME SUCH AS HITBOXES. YOU CANT EVEN SHOOT PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE SWIMMING IN SHALLOW WATER FOR F***S SAKE! NOBODY WANTS F*****G TWITCH PRIME CLOTHES OR NEW GOD DAMN WEAPONS. WE WANT A GAME THAT IS ACTUALLY PLAYABLE! BUT DONT WORRY THE DEVS WILL NOT EVEN LISTEN TO ANY COMPLAINTS YOU HAVE SO HAVE FUN WITH THIS HORRENDOUS GAME GUYS )UPDATE TO MY OTHER UPDATE Eh at this point you will merely play this game because your friends have it and after a certain point you will actually not care how bad the game is due to the fact that if you let everything bad about this game get to you then you will be depressed on a daily basis. So basically at this point I dont have any hope that this game will be completely fixed but what can we do? The devs are doing their own thing ) *Sigh*,Not Recommended

Banning Users They are banning users for team killing even if they are for legitimate reasons and if not and your teammate is being a jerk oh well its part of the game but nope ban. If you are imagined to kill a streamer ban! Like really? This Studio is a joke by far the rudest and most incosiderate studio I have bought a game from. 2. As many others are stating they are trying to cash in and start charging for products while the game has only been out a few months and isn't even finished.This company has released one of the most popular steam games in a while and at this rate bad management and bad policies are going to have users leaving.,Not Recommended
The game only got buggier during the 3 months I've played it.But the developers do no care about that instead of fixing horrifying bugs or the game's net code they spend their working time creating new costumes to sell for real money.Don't buy this game.

I cannot recommend this game because the developers and the creator of the project said that they would not implement microtransactions until the game was finished which they then reneged on. Some of these paid crates added skins with such a low drop rate that said skins skirts short pants long jackets now sell for hundreds of dollars on the Steam market. Yeah no thanks. Tell me why we are testing the loot crate system before you've even finished the bug passes or optimization work?Bluehole and PlayerUnknown have revealed themselves to be dishonest and greedy I know you want money guys everyone does but have some morals. Don't lie. Especially not as a company to your customers. It's repulsive.I wish this game wasn't a fad so that the developers couldn't ride out the bad publicity of such blatantly nasty pratices.,Not Recommended

"In the game could be played until 08.03.18. Today there is a massive update it includes ""performance improvement"" but productivity of 20 fps.

I do not advise buying very damp and not optimized engine.10.03.18 Let's skip the supposedly ""Increase productivity"" theme and go straight to the point. I have 1060 and 8gb. The day before yesterday I bought PUBG. Today I noticed that my feet are growing colder and the room is generally hot. I decided to run SpeedFan and GPU Z to see the temperature and there the video card is sparred by 100% and the temperature is 75gr. this is in the lobby. In the game itself 78 max.

Do not buy this game. It is obvious at this point that PUBG Corp are just trying to milk their playerbase before it completely loses interest.What they are doing is just despicable (within the world of game development of course). Close to nothing seems to be done to address the issues that the players have been enduring for over 6 months. Instead they just seem to remove features in hopes that it will run a bit better while just adding more lootboxes (none of which can be opened without using actual money).I had hopes for this game but knew something was way wrong when they released while it was not even close to finished. The creator (Brendan Greene) is even on record saying that they are aware of some core issues in their engine and that time is the issue not finance (H3 Podcast #44). This is what early access is for You keep the game in that state and work those things out. You don't just release a game with the promise of it being fixed at some point! THOSE ARE THE EXACT PROMISES YOU MAKE WHILE IT IS IN EARLY ACCESS!The fact that they did release it anyway says it all. The ability to add in game purchases and being able to host competitions and championships (just think of the sponsors!) seem to take precedence over actually developing the game.The game can be fun on occassion and I will still be playing now and again but I would not encourage anyone to opt in to this scam.

Game 'released' from early access. Plauged by more lag issues than before particlarly on the new Miramar map. Which is made even more annoying by being thrown into games on the new map 5x more often than the old map. Great game to play if you can actually play it but server connection issues are abhorrent. Also the new fancy party screen takes 3x longer to load into than the previous one after exiting a game. The grass and car are pretty but I dont want to spend a minute staring at it before the game connects to the server.Calling this anything but early access is a sham.

Decent game but overrated,Not Recommended
,Not Recommended
If you want a proper idea of the game I really recommend you check out gameplay videos on youtube. A picture is worth a thousand words. That said Performance You need a fairly decent machine to run this game smoothly at full view distance and high distant detail LOD (screen scale). If you have a potato for a machine you might want to wait on this one.REASON FOR NEGATIVE REVIEW An epidemic of CHEATERS. The game is badly infested with cheaters in all game modes and also lots of griefers teamkilling in random duo and squad matches. The anticheat and devs have been catching and banning as many as 20 000 players a day for using cheats and it is still infested. Every second match has either a speed hacker running faster that cars or invisible players punching people long distance aimbots wall hacks no recoil etc etc. Plenty of video examples on Youtube. Literally thousands of them. The game is nearly unplayable its so bad. The steam forums have cheat distributors openly spamming ads for cheats. So many the mods cant keep up deleting them..For that reason I cannot recommend this game atleast not without this warning. Hopefully they get a handle on the cheating and griefing problem.. I will consider changing my review at that point if they do. Although Im not very happy with the developer for allowing people to grief other regions on this scale of abuse. So there's a good chance my review will remain negative whether they fix these problems or not. Even without the cheatng and griefing half the server filled with 400+ ping players makes the game a serious lag fest. With players teleporting like they are using a lag switch or something.tl dr buy at your own peril CHEATERS GALORE!!!,Not Recommended

"Its an overall pretty bad game due to the fact that its poorly optimized buggy and last but not least very far behind all the other ""battle royale"" games.Long story short good idea bad realization.Obviously there are things that make this game unique and still viable but buying this game right now it's just not worth it.Pros 1) PUBG is by far the most realistic of its kind and can be pretty fun sometimes.That's pretty much it...Cons 1) In 8 games out of 10 you get killed by some lucky guy that drops on a shotgun while you have to run for 3 minutes to find a revolver and you get killed while reloading 2) It takes forever to load a game and thats a big problem especially if you die the first 5 seconds. When you play a lot this gets frustrating very quickly because it takes you more than 1 minute to load (if you dont have an SSD) and the same time to drop from the plane and land 3) The physics in this game are simply broken you can't understand if you dont try it 4) Cheaters A LOT of cheaters 5) ä¸­å›½å¤ä»£ç§˜å¯† 6) The feeling that there's something slightly off that you have in every game.7) Emotes The list will update every time devs will drop an update from their a s s.22 feb 2018New patch made the game unplayable for days UNLESS you deactivate replays and death cam.

"Update It's gotten so much worse! That's really all that needs to be said. Previous review This game is falling further and further into the blue hole. In spite of ""constantly focusing on gameplay and connection quality"" things are fixed for a maximum of one week before they go back to the same garbage again. Keybinds work temporarily then the game forgets the input randomly in a match the plane randomly drops all players still graphical texture related issues still occur regularly matches crash for all players simultaneously lock players on the plane flip and stop vehicles on a flat paved road destroy vehicles randomly without impact get fps drops from 120 0 as soon as a player shoots at you at close range you still get shot after youve long since run behind cover (Talking and unquestionable 1 2 seconds later) even with a ping of 20 30. I love this game but unfortunately it's extremely limited to it's lack of preparation for popular demand and even though it's been basquing in that glory for a year it still for some reason can't find the monetary foothold it needs to get better servers and netcoding. I don't blame the game really but Blue Hole a successful heap of mobile phone app pushing nobodies riding on the back of the first proper PC success they've ever managed. Riding it right off a cliff. BAIL on you publisher split the money you're lining your pockets with and continue to see growth and sales on some other likely brighter horizon.

Pros Thrilling concept easy to learn hard to master. Will make you want to pee your pants.Cons The controls are extremely slow compared to regular shooters it feels as if your character is crawling through treacle. Doors take years to open weapons take eons to equip. I know it's a inheritance of Arma but I still can't get used to it. Shooters are supposed to you feel like an extension of yourself not trapped in a virtual geriatric's body. Poorly optimised uninsipiring graphics. Menu error present from the first time I played until now means I can't quit the game after a match but have to logout of Windows instead.,Not Recommended

PUBG Devs seems like they dont care at all about there true fans/player base since there game is filled with hackers they seem too care more about rolling in more cash from the hacker becasue they keep on rebuying the game over and over give it a year and its probably a dead game. I really like this game but seems like its going to die out because of all the hackers ill change my review when the game get back on its feet since it has taken a big fall because of hackers. The game has alot of potential and will be a great game when its fixed but of right now its in a dark pit of hackers Update 1.0 there is still hackersUpdate the games still sucks the latency where you run behind a wall then die is Asians have infested all the server and are now running the game. This is there home nowUpdate i play this game on weekends with my friend both FPP and TPP and they are both laggy slow and buggy. Feel like this game gets worse and worse with every update. I played this in beta it was beta so dident expect it to run good but i feel like it ran better back then and on release then i does now on final release after early access.

Alright this is probably the most difficult review I've ever had to do.First of all This IS a good game and NOBODY can disagree with that.The main problem with PUBG is the kind of people who play this game they make this game get frustating and boring because you never get to win this ing I've played almost 40 hrs of this game with my friends and I have never won a single ing match because there's always a ing chinese hacker or a ing sniper on a ing bush (fanboys will say I suck at this game but I don't when I play this alone I alway get to be top 20 and with friends top 10)I can't even say that if you like FPS's like CoD or BF you'll like this game for sure because on those games at least you get the pleasure of winning at least sometimes which doesn't happen with PUBG (unless you're a ing 1 ton fat nerd who doesn't have social life and play at least 8 hrs of this ing game everyday) So for all the matter I give a final review of ing 5 5/10 on this piece of (I said the game is good and it is but the ing players make it become a ing piece of And just one more thing about this ing piece of HACKERS!!!!!!!

I really did like this game a lot. Now I can't even play because the servers suck so bad. But oooohhhhhh boy look at all the different crates you can get.... now give the devs more money to be allowed to unlock them. Honestly I'm disgusted by how much they care about cosmetic crap while barely any of the fundamental issues in the game have been fixed. It's obvious that the devs only care about making money and are not committed to improving their game.Loot crates matter more than quality servers the the devs. Don't buy until they fix their broken game and resolve the MASSIVE issues with their servers.,Not Recommended

Ok from my experience there is a lot to say about this game.... Negative.I bought it when this game was 3.6v and now i wish i had ''refund button''.I believed in game and i was hoping it is gonna have some BIG Upgrades &amp Updates but story is completely different. The servers became laggy and i mean really laggy. Tickrate is so u see u took the shoot but other player says and sees different. Hitbox is Hitting a player and seeing the blood effect but player is still alive even tho' the replay recorded his blood effect and he is still 100HP when u watch it on replay ). players swallowing bullets. Updates.Cases a lot of cases. Optimization.They say the game is getting more optimized but trust me its not.The first 100 200hrs of game we're let's just say more optimized.I could go on and on with this so im just gonna write it like this U playing normally with some lag and out of nowhere u see Chinese s flying and coming out of the mountain for some reason and saying ''CHINAAAAAAA NUMBA 1''. REGION LOCK would save every ing server but nooo let Chinese inside EU servers bcz Chinese for life. One match your buildings can load other match its just like puke even tho ure standing next to it. Cheaters everywhere and these guys doesnt know how to make proper anticheat that will prevent them from flying and shooting through walls ). People killing you even tho you went behind the wall trust me guys its not tickrate. He has ing steering wheel attached to his bullets so he just turns them around the wall to kill you. Optimization is so good that these days u cant even load into match u hear people around u but ure still on loading screen and I personally love that &lt 3 . Jumping from a building will kill you but jumping from a ledge that is as twice as big as a building will give you 30 dmg. Don't buy it even if u have friends that will play with you because it will not become as fun like it was before.Die in horrible pain developers )lel,Not Recommended

Dodged the game for a long time but so many people told me to get it and how fun it is.I had some fun in the first 10 hours but now I'm fed up with it for the following reasons I don't play online Multiplayer games to play alone that's my personal preference and the Duo/Squad fight system is just atrocious in my opinion. Headshots do not kill they'll most likely just knock the player out and that can become really ridiculous. When I was playing a Duo with a friend we got into a fight in a bad spott (we were in a valley and out opponents were holding a hill crest) I downed one of them twice and the other one once but they always got each other up again and I didn't even had the chance to finish them since they were always behind the crest as soon as they got downed since they permanently only peaked out with their heads. Yes this is basically an ArmA mod and positioning is quite important I understand that but if I turn out as the better player I still have no chance to make any use of it. When you play with 1 2 or 3 friends you have the choice to drop far away and just loot for the first 10 20 minutes or you drop in a hotzone and most likely lose atleast 1 in the beginning and have him wait for the rest of the round. So you try yourself Solo get a few kills and end up being killed over 200m with Ironsights and a 100% accuracy straight through a bunch of treetops and you aren't even able to see yourself in the deathcam.So if you're lookin for a fun game to play with your friends I wouldn't recommend PubG but if you're lookin for something to play alone from time to time and can accept the fact that you'll stumble across a hacker a but more often than in other games go ahead I guess you can have a great time. PS. I run the game on latest mid range hardware and the performance is good but every 4th 5th game I get stuck in the loading screen which is quite frustrating if you play with friends and want to drop together and people told me that the server tickrates are terrible but I cant confirm this from my own experience.,Not Recommended

PUBG The times where stuff is happening (firefights car chases etc.) PUBG is extremely intense and adrenaline pumping.The times where stuff is not happening (80% 90% of the match) It's monotonous and ing boring.As well as most the matches being painful uneventful slogs the game is also very unpolished. At least once a game some sort of problem will arise sometimes costing me the chicken dinner. I'd have to say the worst part of the whole match is the drop phase (In which you skydive from a plane and then parachute to the ground) I GARENTIE YOU that 7 times out of 10 you won't drop where you think your going to. Players that are good at dropping are really just compensating for the t. It's also telling that the mobile version runs better than both the Pc and Xbox One versions.The gunplay is actually pretty good with a verity of firearms and attachments (compounded with the rarity of the actual gunfights them self) each one is pretty unique and rewarding in there own way.The graphics are murky and ugly as all (on low) and even if you do have 2 Titan X's to run this game at ultra (This is pretty much the new Crisis in those regarded) they still don't really look appealing (you play this game for the gameplay and only the gameplay by the way).The last thing I want to talk about is the developers. In terms of updates to PUBG the devs have only made very minor performance improvements to performance and almost nothing else (apart from that one time they added a map) then they add new skins and and expect the community to believe that there making huge progress with the game (there not). Each update only makes miniscule steps in the correct direction. They have a bunch of new stuff planned for 2018 but unless they fix the base game until until then I struggle to want to support PUBG.If you looking for short bursts of adrenalin buy it. If you don't stay far the away from this game. It's also overpriced for what it is (nearly 30). In high sight I'd buy it for 16 20 maximum. I'd say wait for a sale but it never goes on sale and never will.To fix this game all they need to do is Fix the performance Fix the Drop Phase Fix the servers Fix the graphics Fix the amount of content included Fix the Price TagAnd then and only then do you have a good video game.2/5,Not Recommended

In real life if I was screaming anti semitic chants can the enemy just mute me? No they ing cant. So how come in this ing game the people can just mute me and sound my footsteps and not my vocal steps.

Don't bother.I only have about 100 hours of the PUBG experience so grain of salt and that stuff. Before release I would have recommended PUBG to anyone who's a fan of FPS' but not so much after release and the failing patches that followed.The reason why I say this is the bad Netcode Desync and server issues that have not been resolved since beta nor mentioned by developers or Mr. Unknown himself. Brendan's opinion on PUBG being in permanent beta doesn't give confidence in either his capabilities or his team's to address the issues and/or request from their clients. Customisation is irrelevant. A couple of races a few skin colours some hair choices. At the end of the day you're going to look like everyone else.The lobby doesn't work. It hasn't worked since beta. Every time your friend logs on and you want to invite him Refresh. Can't matchmake Refresh. Text is broken and instead of sentences it's a jumble of matrix looking symbols across your screen Refresh.They had a poor example of rain and fog weather effects not long ago. Rain was terribly loud and in this constant loop. Fog was unrealistically constant and just a pain. After some data mining and realising a lot of their players were leaving matches when put into rain/fog they decided to fix it. By fix it they didn't add the option to have weather effects in the lobby they didn't fix their weather effects based on user feedback they simply removed it which has left a chunk of their community longing for that feature albeit broken.Jumping out of the plane was alright now it sucks. It used to be that you could easily land 3 4 km's radius from the plane's flight path. But I guess that made early game too loot friendly and as one does forced players to land in a much tighter space where 50 people will die in the first 5 minutes of the game.I think looting is one of the best features in the game. On my latest game I was killed by a guy with a suppressed AK with lvl 3 helmet and bag through an iron sight. So it just comes to show you don't always get the good loot but its great fun battling early game for better gear.Getting into a vehicle opening doors and vaulting in PUBG is a game in itself. You press F (interact) to get into a vehicle and nothing happens. You press F again and your character jumps in and out of the car.You stand by a door and press F nothing press F again the door opens and closes in your face like a rude poltergeist REALLY doesn't want you there. You stand in front of a window knowing you can vault through. 10 jumps later you assume that there must be an invisible wall only for your squad member to get through the window first try.When your opponent gets the better of you you'll notice in the death cam there's a 1 2 second delay. For example you're looting and suddenly you drop dead on the floor. Your first instinct is to watch the Death Cam only to notice your opponent has fired 5 shots before any of them registered. When their potat.. servers eventually caught up you died immediately.Concerning the Death Cam after being killed eventually you have to scrutinise every detail of that cam. Did your opponent's aim snap to you did your opponent have any or less recoil than they should after shooting did your opponent see/know/guessed where you were was your opponent's movement speed in any form higher than it should be etc. Seeing as PUBG's BattleEye anti cheat system is nothing but a CPU hog and doesn't seem to know the difference between a script and System32 files. Instead of improving on their anti cheat system as they probably found it fruitless they decided to find and charge the hackers directly. After 120 arrests and 30 cases and an average of 1.5 million players' monthly reports the game is still swamped with cheats.And my latest peeve in PUBG. Microtransactions! We all know what those are. After playing several matches in PUBG you earn Battle Points which is cumulative based on your skill. With these Battle Points (BP for short) you can either customise your character (irrelevant as mentioned above) or buy loot crates. Loot crates give strictly aesthetic items BUT NOW they give you a random loot crate one free to open or one key to open which cost a few dollars to get an item worth $0.64 in the steam market. You see the 404 logic not found error here? Why are loot crates and market purchases our only options? Why is there no PUBG store in the lobby to buy aesthetic items? Why does a virtual leather hoodie cost $1000 in the market? Why knowing that hackers are mainly hacking to win games and items to sell them on the market for ridiculous prices are you not seeing the flaw in this system?And my biggest problem with PUBG is that it feels like sniffing bad cocaine. You know it's very bad but you keep trying hoping the next time might be a little better.TL DR Wait for other Battle Royale titles to be released before purchasing PUBG. The competition might give them some sense to improve or at least fix their title to avoid other better titles to revert their current player base to an actual working title.PS It's been longer than a year after release and still the game is a complete buggy mess.

"This game is like an abusive relationship.Starts out well and you're having some good times yet after some time something changes (this game showing you it's awful technical side) and you start enjoying it less and less.You want to love it you really do and you get these moments where you think you do but actually you ing hate it and never want to have anything to do with it ever again. And yet after some time you end up booting it up again expecting some great times with your mates yet most of the time you just get angry dissapointed and very very salty.A big chunk of games you die as soon as you drop because someone else got a gun before you or leave because your mates died and you don't want them to afk for 30 min.Another big chunk of games you loot/loot+kill everyone at the drop point and then play running simulator until one of the later circles.And the whole time you're just waiting for that one game where everything aligns perfectly you loot well kill loads do some sicks moves and win.And that's fine and is how this game genre works (the rng in looting the midgame downtime) but the last thing you need (when you're already super easily frustrated) are technical issues and oh boy boy oh boy.. this game is riddled with these.The optimization and framerate while way better than prerelease seems to be getting worse with almost every update they put out. (don't forget that all of these updates are anywhere from 1.5 to 9 gigs big lol and are usually just backend changes).The loot lag at the start of the match at the point where the performance of the game is absolutely critical and every second matters is ridiculous and cuts short plenty of games. Same thing when it comes to weapons not loading in until you've went past them and you end up getting blasted by someone who came from the location you were just at a few seconds ago. The parachute feels and acts as if it's made out of bricks and sometimes while landing flings you across the map like a slingshot let's not even talk about the constant random fall damage that would get you anywhere from 95% to 10% hp before you even got to loot a single item. (thankfully they've seemed to fix that in one of the recent updates let's hope it stay's that way).The worst of them all has to be the abysmal hit detection in the early game you seeing blood splatter all across the screen checking the death cam and seeing the game not register the shots at all. (once again especially in the early game when it's absolutely critical that the game performs well)The cheating issues which loads of players have been talking about endlessly.The high latency players usually chinese ) because of whom like this happens). https //giant.gfycat.com/GenuineGleamingBufeo.webm (i don't know how effective this change actually was but atleast in one of the updates they've started grouping people into games by their latency).And these are just the biggest and most obvious issues over the 500 hours i've played i've seen way more problems which most of i can't even remember but here are some off the top of my head.Falling through the map randomly (usually after doing a jump with a vehicle) not being able to rotate camera the weapon scope having no indicators vehicles exploding just by touching certain objects slight contact of a vehicle and player resulting in the player being flung 5 meters and getting knocked teammates having no markers above them getting stuck in walls upon leaving vehicles climbing on top of a box in the water and dying...if i had the will to think about it some more i could come up with a dozen more issues which ruined a match or a few in one way or another.I mean this would've been somewhat fine if the game was still in early access but this game claims that it's fully released (and you'd expect that it would mean the game has a certain amount of polish to it) but i guess they just had to sell some extra copies on christmas. And i'm sure the developers are working hard at fixing these issues but we should be judging the game by what it is not what they're trying to make it be or the effort they put in it. As a cherry on top the game also had ""paid"" lootboxes since early access which...really...is unacceptable imo trying to get more money out of their customers while the game still isn't even finished for 1.0.And yet even after all these criticisms.... i believe new players wouldn't feel as if these issues make the game unplayable.(atleast for the first few hours or dozens of hours because they only stand out after they ruin your games a lot of times)So i'm a bit torn on this one honestly clearly i've played it a lot so there is some appeal to it. I can't say that the game doesn't have great moments especially (atleast in my case) when you play with friends and you fill the prematch and midgame downtime with some banter spend games driving over people chasing the box being a crossbow assassin and getting some chicken dinners every now and then. But really.. i don't think we should be supporting companies like this. Companies that put cosmetic lootboxes prerelease banning ""confirmed"" stream snipers releasing an unfinished product. ( or atleast stop supporting them considering how much money they've made already ) )Oh well while this game has executed this genre better than any game before it there's still a long way to go until we get a BR game done right. You can see that slowly but steadily this game is on decline both when it comes to streaming it and playing it players are sick of it and have moved to fortnite which clearly means that bluehole is doing something wrong. So if you ask me just wait for someone else to perfectly execute this genre or wait for bluehole to sort it's out and make this game great.",Not Recommended

I am amazed by how much I have tried to stick to this game.The game could have added very little and I would have stayed in it for thousands of hours but it felt like with every patch after 1.0 they added something I liked and messed up 30 systems within the game. It got to a point where there is no legitimate reason I can justify putting my limited gaming time into this game. Ridden with bugs updates that just destroy the game auto server assignment that puts you in a server with 200+ ping cheaters (even thoug I must admit this has gotten better since launch) RNG ridden mechanics unworthy high risk high reward situations a developer that honestly looks like it does not care about us about the people supporting their product.The map design is alright for Erangel and Sanghkok but on their Miramar map you pretty much see people for the first 5 minutes then walk around aimlessly for 30 minutes just to see the last 10 players standing the rythm on that map is straight up an insult to the players.The localization of the product is also a mess and I can t believe that it still looks like a rushed product. Thanks for inspiring better developers to get into this genre tho that actually might make me come back into the Genre even if you don t like Fortnite much (not a game for me) there are a lot of games adding the BR mod to their franchises and it surely will be better experience than this.,Not Recommended

This isn't gonna be a complete review about the game. Just my personal thoughts and experience with PUBG SOOO yeah bought the game around 2 months after its release i played it every day. It was such an addictive exercises but as the time went on people started to notice that this game had many problems with it (Many the Optimization and the cheaters that infested the game). I ignored all of it because i truly loved pubg and i never supported any other BR game. AND IT WAS LIKE THAT UNTIL TODAY. PUBG decided to ban my friend from the game. He tried to contact pubg support and basically they told him that they dont really know why he got banned. Its really sad that pubg treats their players this way and i simply can not support their t any longer. YOU PUBG,Not Recommended

"Not a bad game however apparently the mods hand out bans for ""stream sniping."" Using legally avaible information such as a publicly available stream to ""win"" a video game with no real life cosequences may be rude but it should not be a bannable offense. I base this opinion on a couple obvious problems with the ""banned for sniping"" argument. The first is the burden of proof how do you know they were sniping can you prove it? Players of a high skill level in games routinely get reported for cheating I believe there was even an example of this in the news around the launch of Overwatch where a particularly skilled player was called a cheater by other pros only to be vindicated in the end. The stark reality that humans are petty and the mentality of ""I is streamer therefore I best player so if I die that guy cheated! So i use community as weapon!"" is something that should not be encouraged. The second is that even if someone is sniping that is not a legitamite reason to ban them no one is forcing the streamer to do so they could use a delay to help alleviate the problem and furthermore the size of PUBG alone would seem to favor the streamer by making matching with them very unlikely. All in all the position taken by this game's management clearly states they care more about appeasing the top personalities who show interestest in the game rather than the vast majority of their playerbase and are willing to ban players to soothe the egos of said personalities.",Not Recommended
There is a chance that due to a memory leak issue the game can crash so hard that you are forced to totally power down your PC. This would be what we commonly call a 'critical issue'. This happened every time I played the game at some point or another I've never left the game by choice. Tried finding support through the forums no response.Tried reaching out to the PUBG_Help Twitter no response.If Bluehole are going to ignore this problem that could practically brick user's PCs I have no choice but to warn others to be very wary of this Early Access title. It could lock up your PC and unless you're an 'influencer' you're not likely to receive any support.,Not Recommended

This game was great at the beginning and the new patch fixed a lot but it's unplayable with the amount of hacking going on.

Basically it is a good game and way better than Fortnite (at least in my opinion). Still since the latest update the games keeps crashing almost every second game as soon as you're being shot. Therefore you don't really know whether it crashes 'cause you died or just because of any other reasons. Really frustrating! EDIT Well now it doesn't crash anymore but instead the servers are really laggy! Not only at the star of every round but also after playing 10 or 15 minutes. It really sucks if you try to sneak on an enemy and then everything freezes for 15 seconds and afterwards you're dead. Really great ... Dunno if it is because the servers are anywhere in the world?

Many have been the time that some of my most considerate teamates have been chinese (granted not being able to speak chinese in a team game with all chinese players can be its own hell). What im saying is EVERY time im killed via hack its a chinese player doing it. Every...single...time.... ive never seen anything like it. This company's ""outrage"" over ""racist"" players coming down on the poor chinese players (granted some of the rants ARE super racist) is just a B.S. excuse to not limit the cash cow that is the chinese market.*update* 2/17/18 So after the million (chinese) man ban the game was playable for a week. The cheaters have realized that with no REAL investment in anti cheating by Bluehole its safe to make new accounts and resume making the game unplayable. Bluehole seems to not mind since its just another revenue stream for them. Probably why they ban in nice spaced out waves to make it worth it for cheaters to get their new cheat account on for a decent interval.

A lot has been coming to the surface about these shady developers recently. Mainly the fact that the developers have implemented a gambling box economy with microtransactions and that players are being banned for 1 of 2 reasons which are insane. (1) incountering the very common no load bug and (2) killing a player who is live streaming the game.(1)Instead of fixing the game bugs the deveoplers are choosing to ban players whom it occurs to hiding behind a motif that those players are abusing the game. It's early acess arn't bugs suppose to be a prevelant issue needing to get fixed? Instead the developers ban people who encounter them (even several people who took video footage of bugs and reported them got banned)!Furthermore the majority of the threads reporting bugs consist of fan boys telling the person who has the bug that IT IS THIER FAULT &amp NOT THE DEVS. The most common of which appears to be shifitng the blame from the dev to the player via they need a ssd or that they need more ram (when the OP of all these threads the majority of time met or exceed the listed min. system req.).(2)Next you have ridiculous live stream bans (esp the ones involving cars). This isn't a fault on the player but has to do within the streaming platform were the strongest influence is money &amp user growth.For starters there are the obvious issues TONS of he said she said finger pointing (I watched one of the streamers who was Called out by someone who got banned and EVERYTIME they got killed or shot at they were calling stream sniper this and that).People are essentially being penalized for nothing and the TOS needs to be changed to include a statement where streamers who are live do so at thier own risk and that any streamer before even being allowed to file a complaint must show that they wern't live but instead had a delay in thier broadcast by X amount of time (like how any MOBA does).But instead of using the supplied data for the use of modifying thisgame into something better like most things these days the devs instead seek to shut down any change in favor of $$$.Speaking of money this game includes gambling (loot) boxes that charge you real money as if you were playing a F2P game. $$$(Also the optimization and bug fixing has still yet to show themselves but you can rest in peace knowing that new gambling boxes are on thier way out towards you!)DO YOURSELF A BIG FAVOUR SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO PLAY FORTNITE,Not Recommended

Don't support PUBG Corp they are shady and focus more on their budding esport than improving the game despite the millions upon millions of dollars they've made off of both the upfront price of PUBG and the on going micro transactions in loot crates weapon skins and more recently the battle pass system which has grown popular from Fortnite. The game itself can be fun but depending on your viewpoint the bugs can either ruin your experience or enhance them depending on if you're tryharding for wins or if you're just trying to have fun with a squad of friends. The biggest issue is the ability to play the game from Oceania as the OC server itself is a baron wasteland for solo/duo players who are then forced to play in the Asia/SEA servers which have a massive number of cheaters/hackers that go unpunished and if they are punished there's no way you can tell if you report them.Edit So PUBG Corp have made changes that tell you if a player you reported is banned which is nice. A new issue that's arisen is the inability to choose which server to play on. You now play on a pre determined server and as someone in Oceania that 100% means I get put in a game with exclusively SEA/AS players and there's nothing I can do about it. Absolutely horrible.Overall only play this game if you got it as a gift and don't spend a dime on it at all. PUBG Corp do not deserve any of your cents until they start making progressive changes in improving the game's functionality gameplay and hackers.,Not Recommended

"It seems to be buying a game in the genre of"" battle Royale"" and got some horror with elements of science fiction. You can go to the thing and try to take it but it will just stay in place or just disappear. And maybe youll have it in 5 seconds. It is possible that in this game items have their own mind.Your opponents can sometimes move leaps and bounds. I dont know if its due to the Chrono shift or if the enemies cant sync up in our reality but its going to be hard to damage them. With you incidentally this too can will happen.Transport in the game also has its own mind. If you Park next to any object (fence barrel wall etc.) then the car will not like it and it will start to rage attack the offender or just roar. Also game have anomaly ""Springboard"" like in S.T.A.L.K.E.R and if during the trip you missed it you can fly up a few meters even if you were driving on a flat road. Do not believe that all people in the game. In fact there are creatures from the other world which only represent the model of human behavior. But when theyre in danger they use their powers. Here is an incomplete list immortality self guided bullets vision through the walls teleporting to any point at the request of the owner the transformation of any land transport in the flying fast movement (Sonic mode). Also these creatures though deprived of reason but has a sense of purpose evolution and rapid reproduction that even developers can not cope with them. What would you not think that you can easily win just by developing strategies for survival and knowing the subtleties the game pumps you a special poison. This poison can distort your perception of the world due to what will seem that the picture slows down or there is an effect of framing leads one to suspect the Bush gave the enemy makes you think you're safe lying in the grass however actually lie in an empty field. Also this poison is able to give you a false trajectory for grenades and you throw it out the window and into the wall false hope of causing damage to the enemy although you do not get on it or just do not shoot (hallucination) periodically you will have the feeling that the game is physics.Like a cherry on a cake the game has its own screamer. His name is ""Bad Module"" and he can arise at any time (he does not mean himself a quiet frightening music). Although it is difficult to call it a screamer since for the most part it makes you angry.The game has some more ""strange"" things but I wrote about the ones I encounter more often.",Not Recommended

Bought this game a week ago it is a great concept. However I am constantly being put into the Asian server with 230 ping (or above) and seems to be unplayable with this high ping. I usually can just try and leave the match and hope to connect to the Australian server which has 70 ping for me. Today I was connected to the Asian server 20 times in a row and finally gave up and quit the game Also many matches on the Asian server I have been blasted with audio of some sort of advertisment in Chinese that is really loud. Also feels like I am playing against pro players as soon as I started playing which is a bad experience for a new player. Feeling ripped off...,Not Recommended

The learnning curve is too harsh. would be fun if either the players had more health or spawned with armor but at this point at time you die with 1 bullet before you even pick up a gun. To then wait another 3 minutes in matchmaking lobby and server. I understand it supposed to be realistic but it is so realistic the game becomes a chore to play. It can be fun if you get to the less then 30 player point but overall this game is more luck then skill in first 3 minutes in game. So close to being good its annoyingwould play again if it had more health or grace period of at least 45 seconds implemented,Not Recommended

I had an old positive review before this game came out because I was looking forward to how the game would eventually turn out. I thought Y'know this game may have it's bugs but it's super fun to play with friends and suspenseful to play solo. 1.0 rolls around and people are dropping the game or keep playing i kept playing thinking eh 1.0 rolled out with a new map some new balances and some fixes i'm sure there's still stuff they're working on...that's a good one. The last few good things they've done was balance weapons and add map selection (since Miramar blows). Welp these GENIUSES decide to get rid of map selection and then they sue Epic because they've shot themselves in the foot so much they ran out of ammo. If the next update fixes the netcode hitreg and other major bugs i'll keep playing but why do that when you can add a new crate.,Not Recommended
Firstly I still play this from time to time. The game itself is fine but the terrible optimization and the laggy servers are just breaking. I don't even care that much that the developers are whoring their game baby out through transactions and useless cosmetics. But I am most certainly against gambling and straigh up abuse of weak minded kids (i.e. the gambling with locked chests). It's fun enough if you don't take it seriously accept the terrible aspects of the game and imagine it is in beta and you play with friends. Any other approach will leave you wanting that 30euros back. I would not recommend this to anyone.,Not Recommended

Tl dr CHEATERS!!!I bought this game when it was in early access and the cheater problem became more appear after PC V1.0 update. The thing that made me buy this game was streamers. I enjoyed the game up to now. Even though I lost every match I played it was fun to play this game. I am not a guy who downvotes every video game etc. This game is the thing I downvote.The main problem of this game is CHEATERS!!! Also there are other reasons why you can't enjoy this game. You can't play because someone has written some code to make auto aim or hit players behind obstacles ( I see those cheaters every game I play especially in TPP Squad Mode in Erangel map). You have option to report players who cheat but you can't see the result of your report. Even in ETS2 Multiplayer (which is a free mod with the collabration of people who works as volunteers) you show/see your evidence as a video of your report and the result of the report in their website (ban kick etc.). I don't know if they written an algorithm to block spam reports (someone may report every lose) As a result I don't believe that they can handle millions of reports in a day. (since it needs money to hire people to look for reports) To conclude if you are not a cheater you can't enjoy this game.,Not Recommended

"Pubg has been one of my favorites ever since I picked it up back in april of 2017. So it's been over a year and the game is in full release. This is to be taken lightly though as the game is still riddled with bugs and instabiltiy problems. On my backup pc I can't even play this game (crashes past launch) due to the mentioned bugginess. The game is fun though and I've racked up my fair share of hours so far and soon will reach 700 hours. My problem with the game is the way the developer handles it. The departments for bug fixes and patches appears to work slowly at best and often take months to fix glaring issues with the game. While the ""in game purchase"" side of the game is flourishing with constant updates and patches to ensure that the up and coming players have their fair chance at spending 60 dollars to buy a skin that my 10 year old cousin could design better. Basically the customizables feel rushed and cheap at best. In comparrison to another game with skins Counter Strike comes out far ahead as their cheap skins look reasonable and function well with the game. Pubg's ""Cheap"" skins are anything but enjoyable and are a bear minimum that needs to change. Gameplay wise the game runs fine on my pc with over 90FPS but occationally stutters here and there. The movement is clunky and the weapons feel like your character has never lifted in his life making for extremtly bouncy rocoil. I feel the spirit of this game died on full release back in December of 2017. The original crowd that plays this game has mostly either left or only occationally comes back to play. Personally I logged at least 16 hours a week playing this game before the full release but with the change in gamestyle and desync issues I stopped playing anywhere near as much. To save the game the Dev team needs to cater to those who play the most of their game and stop listening to Gaben on how to make money. Listen to your playerbase or like many other big titles around you will lose us all together.",Not Recommended
Good game. Played a lot. Lots of fun.Not anymore. Way to many hackers.Now PUBG corp has my money. I only bought one copy. Hackers buy many copies. Hackers get banned so they will buy a new copy.

We have supported this game since early access. PUBG has made over $730 million dollars. Yet it's still not optimized cheaters are rampant crates are locked behind keys. Even after charging $30 for the game they now introduce this $9.99 Event Pass.They promised us no DLC but while the maps are free missions rewards and progression will come at a cost. They ask for feedback but get upset that we're not singing their praises. If this were free to play none of us would care. It's just a shame. A damn stupid shame.This whole thing is a tone deaf slap in the face to all of us who have supported the game since launch.,Not Recommended
Although a good concept this game has faced major flaws since its release. Devs have still not done anything about the rampant hacking and latency abuse especially by chinese players who saturate regional Oceanic servers just as much as the Australian housing market. Until steps are taken to region or ping lock these hordes of illiterate Communists PUBG will not reach a higher potential of which to make the game more appealing to anyone outside of China.,Not Recommended
With the new 1.0 release the game got ed up. Vaulting system with no cancel Vehicle driving as if its on ice New map is either too bland or too much No choice to choose a map and 75% of the time its the new map which sucks There ARE still bugs and lags and you name it even after the patchThis is my personal opinion. I hate the new map. And you cant even pick which one to play on.If this continues like this rather than listening to the people who are actually playing this game. Then this game will be done,Not Recommended

"Played a fair bit of this game and it was enjoyable i had some great times and wish it didnt have to come to an unexpected end. the game itself came a long way from the beggining an i as one although not playing it as much as some saw it change throughout the yeah and a half i had it. on the 5th october I tried to open the game only to be met with a screen saying ""you have been banned from STEAM"" i reloaded the game to see if it was a glitch in the system or something but it wasnt. I never exploited the game or cheated in any way i saw that Macro keys and key loggers also where forbidden so i avoided those as well. Later that afternoon i message the PUBG support team asking for more information on my false ban and if it was possible to get it reviewed so it could be lifted. the reply i got basically said that they where aware of my acount restricion and where unable to reasses the restriction and could not provide me with any more information on my ban as it is against their rules. After a couple of emails each asking the question of ""is it possible to get my $30 USD refunded back to my account as a have been falsly banned"" they avoided the question to the point where i gave up. The game itself is fun however both battleeye and the PUBG support team are useless. im giving this a thumbs down purely for this reason. Im not trying to persuade anyone to either buy or not buy the game for any reason I just wanted to inform any potential buyers of the game or even current payers that this false banning issue is real and it is something you will need to watch out for.An update on this have finally stopped talking with PUBG support team and they have not lifted the ban.I hope this helped you in some way or anotherHave a good day )",Not Recommended

during early access i was okay with the game being clunky and bugged and desynced. After the release it got only worse imo. This game is the perfect example on how not to make a game but still get it sold somehow. releasing crates with skins which you have to get different keys for instead of fixing the game. I mean obviously you gotta drop 70 % of your playercount before you realize that your product might perform like and people are annoyed by it. Most dangerous thing that happened to the gaming industry. apparently you can get away with selling poop and make tons of money with it.

1624 hours in this game.... I first want to say to the Dev's Thank you so much for bringing Battle Royal to us gamers. Millions of us had never heard of it or dreamed of it. Thank you for that. But... And i do mean BUT!!!! It's been years now and the desync is getting worse. I die so much without seeing my killer only to see him run around the corner to look my body that is 5 feet away. I'm truely sad that after all this time nothing has changed. New maps yay New weapons yay New I don't care!!!!!! I am finally uninstalling this game and i hope to never return I'm sure i will because i hate fortnite. But i will uninstall again. Because i have lost faith that you will ever find out how to get Desync to a reasonable level. This is maybe the saddest review i've ever writen. normally i'm just mad but right now i'm just disappointed in knowing that Pubg will never be what we all hoped. A great BR game that fixed it's issues. Instead just another broken game that spent to much time trying to push loot boxes down customers throats.,Not Recommended

This is sad early access doesnt let you get away with it when you sell this many copies. You have the money to reinvest and fix it fast by probably hiring some more people but instead you go the other way and try to lower the bar the community has for you.

Honestly...I love this game. I like it more than fortnite if that's why you've started to read this review. But that's just me I'm not a fan of the building system. With this game the gameplay is solid. The gunplay is decent and the looting system is acceptable. It's your standard good graphics battle royale. There you go. Why am I giving this game a thumbs down?Because its stupid microtransactions loot crate + key system. I already paid for this game and now as I put my hours in it it shoves countless chests in my face asking me please please sir...please put more money into my mouth so that I can be better than fortnite and you can get another pink TShirt. Don't get me wrong folks. I actually have made money off this game 80 dollars to be precise from getting a good customization item. However I feel that this system of crates+keys when already paying half the price of a AAA game is abusrd. You do one or the other. Not both. That's why this review is difficult to pinpoint. I love the game I love the gameplay but I hate how the developers are trying to make the money from it. There are much better ways to go about it yet they choose the key+crate clown fiesta that just annoys the living crap out of me. It feels as though especially lately I get at LEAST 75% of my crates as locked crates requiring me to pay $2.50 dollars more just to get that TShirt. Honestly I want to say it feels like more 90% but I don't want to be making this review seem too hyperbolic. TL DR Great GAME. Horrible Marketing Strategy and Dev's aren't focusing well. If there was any other game similar to this game and Fornite (without the building aspect) I would support it over this game at this point...but this is what I'm stuck with.,Not Recommended

I can't recall a gaming company (Bluehole Inc.) that has been more contemptuous or simply indifferent of their players feedback regarding game play mechanics and how to make the game more enjoyable. Their seems to be a culture of maliciousness when it comes to player survivablity. Killing off your player base with glee incompetence and bugs seems ultimately a poor buisness model. It's a shame. This game could have been one of the greatest games of all time. Now my guess is will be remembered with the same contempt show by it's executive team and developers.,Not Recommended

This game may have a huge following and every streamer plays it 24/7 but tbh this is a game where you spend 90% + of your time running around piking stuff up and interacting with nobody whilst feeling no fear worry or rush the only time the game is intense is when your in the last 5 and the area is small but that only happens to 5% of players each game the way to win is hiding untill the end and trying to have fun will get you killed quickly.Not to mention the voice chat is horrible and the loot box system in early accses is BS follwed by only having 1 map and half of the textures are incomplete even on a I7 4790k and GTX 1070 with 16GB ram on a SSD this game stutters all the time with low fps.If you want battle royale i couldn't recommend fortnite more especially considering that its FREE and is a finshed product,Not Recommended

Shame on bluehole! the game costs 30$ and you don't get a worth for this price. I mean come on the game made over 540 million dollars there should be noe excuses. The servers are mega I think pubg servers have something like 16hz tick rate while fortnite has 20 and csgo gets complaints that its server refresh rate is 60hz. I also sometimes teleport back and forward which feels like high ping when playing on my local servers when the ping is supposed to be lower than 50ms. The game has been waiting for an optimisation patch because you need like a gtx 1080 to run this game smoothely. Now I actually think that this game has been poorely programmed because the game runs like absolute and I don't think even an optimisation patch will fix it. The gameplay is something like 95% running 4 percent looting and 1 precent shooting. So most of the time you end up getting killed after all that hard work of looting. Car physics are I feel like vechicels were invented for pubg funny moments on youtube. There are many more other things wrong with this game.

Used to love the game and it has so much potential but every time they 'fix' something they break 5 more things. Somehow this far in the game is in a worse place than it was previously. Pre ordered some COD (which thank god is coming with many more modes now including Battle Royale) and can't wait to get away from this. After COD I fear that I'm back to my addiction with this game. COD is still just COD and the Battle Royale is not nearly the same. Despite all it's issues there just nothing that combines all the (positive) qualities this game has and provides a better experience. I still can't recommend you start playing this game... but I can't find better for Battle Royale.,Not Recommended

I've just about had it with all these Chinese hackers I tell you what. Which is a damn shame because up until they started pouring in to ruin everything I was more than happy with the game as it was a tense heart pounding battle royale even if it's still in need of a good deal of polish.As it stands though? When I've gotten to a supply crate for the first time in ages grabbed a good sniper rifle and 8x scope and then retreated up into the mountains to observe and snipe I would sincerely appreciate not dying out of nowhere watching the deathcam seeing a fella with a Chinese name running around way below me suddenly snapping his aim way up into the mountainside swapping to his scoped sniper rifle and then putting a bullet through my skull on his first perfect shot.Until this problem's dealt with I've had enough I'm uninstalling and I can't recommend anyone else buy this either. It's not xenophobic to not want to die unfairly every other round.Also China.,Not Recommended
Alright... holy I bought the game with my fathers credit card back in November 2017. Ive owned this game for a year now and I have to say when I got the game it was super fun I mean there was occasional like spikes but it never messed any gunfights or anything it'd maybe happen once a game. THEN came the updates and I stopped playing for a month or so. I loved the game when I got it and with the crates and stuff I actually made my money back from the game. With hundreds of hours I can say in my opinion that the game has decreased in server perfomance. I used to have an i3 6100 and a gtx 950 and the game ran at about 60fps on med low settings now I have a gtx 1060 6gb and a ryzen 5 2600x and the game can run at about 80 120fps on high ultra and people complain about the optimization but I think its not bad for a massive map.The cosmetics they added such as the suicide squad for a price is just stupid. NO ONE ASKED FOR SUICIDE SQUAD IN PUBG and they added it and its very SAD! I dont want to come home after school and play this game anymore I would honestly rather play fortnite than this and Im 15. I strongly dont reccomend you waste your money on this until its either on sale for at least 50% off or the reviews for this game are positive. The dovelopers keep adding random no one asked for and (exept sanhok) they arent focusing all their attention on the de sync or other major problems. They did add this thing called Fix Pubg and its just them putting up the doveloper notes and I think that they should stop all of the cosmetic updates and focus mainly on the gameplay once the gameplay is near flawless then add useless like suicide sqaud outfits.,Not Recommended

Need to eliminate cheaters. Just ran into a guy who was using all cheats possible. Chinese players are still cheating like crazy. Rubber banding is still a problem. Everytime I land on a roof it rubber bands me off of it or gives me damage. Also developers choose the dumbest time to do maintenance on the servers. Learn from Blizzard and any major pc gaming company. They do maintenance when most players aren't playing. Each new update these developers manage to mess up something else or remove something they can't fix. Nowhere near Esports ready. I'm pretty sure the developers don't want to get rid of the Chinese players because after they ban them they just rebuy the game. It's almost EA level Money before customer.,Not Recommended

this game is only good with friends it becomes sometimes lack luster trying to find someone to kill if you drop in a desolate area the graphics are trash for this day and age and ramp up the gpu usage for only god knows why cause it looks awful the game play is a bit off with the aiming as well a prooblem i never have in siege or other shooters.,Not Recommended

I'm not one to write a negative review or a review in general but I hit my breaking point. This game should still be in beta. There is zero excuse for the current state of the game for the amount of money it has made. I tried giving pubg a chance to improve and it has let me down. If the shopping list of problems this game currently has are not resloved pubg is just going to be lost in the battle royale genre and get killed as #99 by some asian hacker or by a free to play fort building BR.,Not Recommended

YOU MUST READ THIS BEFORE THE BUY.Look at this game all battlegrounds. I wanna say this game is so ing dope man. But it need to optimisation more like GTA 5. My PC handle GTA 5 on high very high MSAA x8 but when i use anti aliasing on medium my pc stuck at 50 55 fps. You know the most factor of the game is FPS. I just want more fps on my 1000$ PC. This game has gone so far on the road and still going on the way. You can beat a battleroyale game with another battleroyale game. This game pushes me to buy a new graphic card or mobo I mean should I pay a lot of dollars for this 30$ game? Is that gonna worth? If i should I need to work like one month for the pay in my country(Turkey). I really dunno. Fortnite has advertised everywhere man and they pay streamers to play it. There are some reasons to people watch prefer fortnite like my latest sentence. I know Fortnite and PUBG have got different play styles but everyone comparison. They must know keys are gamers. They must do things for gamers. Because we paid we played and we judge. That's our rights. If you got still need to fix it so why you bring skins soo early? I dont wanna explain about players in the game like camping(stand like tree for 20mins with shotguns). To avoid prefer playing FPP but it is not the fix. When this game ready for the E SPORTS then my $30 gonna worth it.BEST REGARDS AND THANKS FOR READING,Not Recommended

The game would be fun if the North American servers were not ridden with Chinese players who eat 12 13 AR bullets in the chest and face before dying. The game would be fun if the latency issues because of Chinese and other Asians players playing on servers they should not be on because their country ruined it for them. The game would be fun if I wasn't being shot 2 4 seconds after I peek because Asian servers are terrible and so all of their players play on North American servers giving them distinct advantages over the North American players making the game terrible and all around not fun. Would not recommend buying unless it goes on sale for around $5 other then that it would be a waste of time.Months after this review was written and the game has been fully released and nothing has shown improvement the developers have all around said the customer we already made our money. Sounds are beyond broken in the game since people who are right next to you running will sound like they are on the floor above you. The game is at most a broken start up game that has hidden its true intentions of making money that is it. The developers have done nothing to improve the game in any aspect and have since gone towards a more traditional route of milking their customers dry by adding weapon skins worth money. In all this game is not worth the time and effort to play and I pity those who have had to sit through over a full year just to be given a big middle finger to the face by Blue Balls Corporation.,Not Recommended

PLENTY OF CHEATERS.

Even though the numbers have dropped this is still heavily affecting the game and user experience. Countless game breaking bugs (getting killed by nothing when vaulting getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed reloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed...) HORRIBLE performance issues (High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium high settings at all times) Hilarous netcode.

There are many issues with the game that I have very little to no faith that Bluehole will take interest in addressing in the foreseeable future. For a game that is more demanding than Crysis 3 yet has lower graphics and texture fidelity it is easy to understand why people are saying this game is horribly unoptimized. One of two things can happen to this game. It will either age well or it won't age well. For $30 it is a tough pill to swallow. At best I wouldn't pay more than $20 at its current state. I'd definitely wait for the game to go on sale before jumping on the bandwagon but until then Fortnite is a free alternative to Battlegrounds.,Not Recommended

I wanna start off saying i've got a few hours in this game so i thought it was time i wrote something about this game especially with its current state and impending release sometime before the end of the year. I love this game and you'r gonna love this game but when you start to notice the desync problems and the hackers and the bull shots you know hit but didn't but then you get headshot*Desync* after a while enough is enough. BLuehole we know your working hard to fix the problem but in its current state i can NOT give the game a thumbs up. I'm hoping with release i can change this to a thumbs up but we need to see an improved system for better early game and less desync mid/late game. **Take my review with a grain of salt as not all experince's are the same**,Not Recommended

"This game really is a disappointment. The reason why it's disappointing is because it would be a great game if only the devloper would iron out all the huge issues that make this game bad. Some of the issues are TERRIBLE optimization. Probably the worst I've ever seen. I have a 7700k an overclocked 1080Ti and 16gb of DDR4 ram and I'm also running the game from a Samsung 960 Evo M.2 SSD yet this game still runs like absolute garbage on LOW settings. There's also constant screen tearing everywhere. Servers (or the EU server at least) are laggy. I have 23ms when I play LoL on the EUW server and I have about 25ms playing Overwatch on EU servers. When I play either of those games I can enjoy them at low ping and with no packet loss but on this game I feel like I'm always playing at over 100ms plus packet loss. I'm unsure as to what my real ping is because unfortunately the developers haven't been bothered to implement visible ping. But whatever it is it feels bad. This one isn't really an ""issue"" but is just something that I personally dislike. I think the map is too big (for solo mode at least). I played quite a few games today and honestly I probably only saw an average of about 4 people per game. I've made it into top 10 a few times while only having 1 or 2 kills. The reason why is because this game is basically camping simulator 2017. You camp wait for the next playzone to reveal itself get into the very edge of the next playzone then repeat. If you go around looking for other players to kill you just massively decrease your chances of winning. Combine all this camping with the huge map and you end up with quite a stale game where you don't really see much action at least in my experience. I had games where I'd get an early kill then run towards the next playzone for 10 minutes only to get sniped by some guy with a Kar98k. It's just kinda boring.Now all this being said if the devs sorted out the god awful optimization and maybe sorted out the servers too then that would already change this review to a recommended one. There's also a new map on the way. Hopefully this one is more interesting and isn't needlessly big. Right now though I can't recommend this game. It has a good baseline but just isn't finished. It really feels like you're playing an early alpha build or something.",Not Recommended

Unless you have an SSD or an unusually fast HDD don't get this game because you're not the target audience. Several months back the load times massively increased presumably due to a bug they never bothered to fix or something. This means that without an SSD you'll never even see the plane that drops you off. You'll be stuck on a loading screen with sound until you get automatically kicked out of the plane meaning every game you'll be thrown out to the egde of the map usually with a cluster of other so affected players. You'll be lucky to avoid dying to the blue circle due to this since most of the time you'll find yourself starting in the water well out to see.,Not Recommended
I give a ton of credit to PUBG for shaking up the shooter genre this game mode was a breath of fresh air that I feel really drew a new level of interest to first person shooters again. One thing I really appreciate about PUBG is how social of a game it is as the downtime lets you chat with your squad (if playing with one) and essentially just hang out while you decide what to do next before your next expected (or unexpected) combat encounter.Everything about the mode itself is brilliant where this game falls down for me is just the core combat (the controls the feel of the weapons and shooting) it felt so off and janky to me that I just could not enjoy the game. Everytime I killed someone it felt like luck and anytime I got killed it felt frustrating.If they clean up the feel of shooting in the game then I would probably feel better about recommending it.,Not Recommended
"Since there are no indian servers i was forced to play on chinese and SEA servers where my ping and desync ensured that I had a miserable experience every time i played. Combine that with new glitches every time i opened the game and I'd pretty much given up on the game being playable at all. Since fix PUBG 95% of these glitches have been fixed and even though every patch brings in more bugs than it fixes its in a lot better shape than it has ever been.However given the unreliability of the developers and their weird priorities i find it hard to recommend anyone to pick this game up. Unless you're a hardcore fan of BR games and think the number of times you'd like to smash your head in frustration is worth the chicken dinners and the odd ""only in PUBG"" moments you're better off playing something else.",Not Recommended
Product received for free. Other than Leadership boards there is no progression in this game except for collecting clothing and accesories. This would be fine except to have the privilege to have a random chance at getting an item you have to both earn enough in game currency to buy a Loot Box and then spend real money on a key to open it. Otherwise the only thing you can do with in game currency is swap your character's model and skin from a set selection. Having no progression system would of been fine. Having a loot box system also would of been fine if you didn't have to buy in with real money. As it stands you pay a big chunk of money to play a game that earns you the right to pay smaller amounts of money for a chance to get cosmetic items. This kills the game for me.I could overlook the buggy animations and netcode wonky feeling gunplay and incoherent art design but the implementation of microtransactions is the rebar that breaks the camels back.Edit Welp they added an Event pass. They copied Fortnite's Battlepass charged the same amount for it and it's only useable for only 4 weeks as opposed to 10 contains less stuff and has temporary conent. THIS IS A FULL PRICE GAME.

an event pass. Cheaters are still ing everywhere and networking is somehow getting worse. Devs keep adding more and more microtransactions instead of reading feedback or fixing bugs. This isn't a free to play game this is a $30 game there is no reason at all to have *any* microtransactions or even passes. Fortnite can get away with it because it's free and the passes in that game can be unlocked with in game currentcy from just simply playing the game. PUBG will wither and die within the next year if these concerns aren't adressed.,Not Recommended
"Fundamentally the game has good gameplay (Although it was nothing new even for Battle Royale) and can even be enjoyable if you ignore the veriety of bugs and glitches in the game and very apparent lack of polish. Netcode and RNG are also quite bad but worst of all the developers are taking every chance they have in order to squeeze as much money out of the game as possible by adding crates keys purchasable items and skins and now a $10 """"""""""battle pass"""""""""". Unless you need to play battle royale right away then don't buy this game and wait for another game to take it's place it's almost inevitable!",Not Recommended

"It is an addicted game of course but I feel that the gun drop rate are sucks even you are reach in a big city. Riding motorcycle also easily to get crash due to the high sensitive terrain even you are drive it carefully. Some of people can kill me due to ping and latency. When I watch a dead cam the killer target his cosshair backward my walking position not a forward position. And honestly to say content itself are same (Parachuting get a guns spoted or be spotted and killed or be killed or maybe you may be killed by a player using programs) those cause boring afterwards even some partner are able to create a custom map (normal play and zombie mode)._____________________________________________________________Add comments in 9th June 2018WAR MODE Honestly I think this mode is good for practice. You jump down with a gun find someone and shoot them. Not only for shoot practice but this mode encourage you to find a good location and realize a potential location for taknig fire or spot. Game duration is quite well you can try again and again. I like it. GUN DROP RATE ISSUE I still find no guns in a big city (or it difficult to find one) I feel like a gun drop rate in beta test is more likely higher than current. CHEATING ISSUE Athough Bluehole are trying to Cheaters in every games. Today I found someone who killed me in War mode using painkiller while walking!? OMG! What should I do? Just accept it? C'mon. If the developers are intentiaonally to deal with cheaters you should add ""Report"" button in War mode too. GAME CONTENTS Look same jump out finding a gun shoot someone or being shot by someone got a rage because you can't find him or maybe they are cheaters. Also if thsi game can add some fresh contents e.g. mini mission during play 50 (Attackers) V 50 (Defenders) or Make a futuristic maps would be more attractive. I still feel that this game has more potentials to make it isn't it.______________________________________________________________Add comments in 30th June 2018TEAMKILLING ISSUE AND COMMUNICATION ISSUE Some people may got experienced from teamkilling I got experience more recent when I played in Squad. of course I reported all of them. But how can we ensure that those people will got ban? Last time I played with a player and he did not talked in English. When no ones respond to him he started to fire to his teammate. ESPECIALLY IN SEA SERVER. I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD IF A DEVELOPER TEAM CAN ADD SOME PLAYER PREFERENCES (SUCH AS LANGUAGE PREFERENCES) IT NECESSARY BECAUSE THIS ISSUE RELATED TO TEAM COMMUNICATION DURING GAMEPLAY.GUN DROP RATE ISSUE It looks improved. But to be honest I think I can see more chraters than a gun in a big city.______________________________________________________________Add comments in 25th July 2018CUSTOM ROOM CREATE ISSUE This feature might be good for a normal players to play or practice him or herself or playing with friends. It should be good if we can add bots to play with us. However there are many players creating a custom room but cannot playable because no one join to a game (It needs at least ten players in each round). This feature now is beneficial to Streamers to play with their followers. Also there are some pproblem during gameplay (especiall. in warmode). However this update might be a starting point for create a game playing with bots in the future.GUN DROP RATE ISSUE I cannot find a gun even I launched in a big city. If this is a kind of bad luck this game is a kind of a lucky trial game.WEATHER ISSUE I like this update issue much because I miss foggy condition and rainy condition. And these condition is good to practice your ear during play.GAME OPTIMIZATION ISSUES Still needs improvements especially when you driving motorcycles and riding in a mountainous area it still split easily. Gun direction also need to improve as well some players shoot behind a target but still hit.COMMUNICATION ISSUE As a mmo games there are many nationalities in games (esp. in SEA server) So there are many languages in games such as Chinese Vietnam Korean Thai English and so on. I recommend the developers add a language preference during matchmaking. It might be good for communicate in team during gameplay. As you see I'm not recommend this game and I keep updating my review in this game. Because I really like this game I learned a lot of tactics during play even good or bad but this is a good experience for me in BR games. And I hope the developers read my reviews and comments sometimes.",Not Recommended

Good game overall but wasnt enjoyable to start playing because of the large initial skill gap which I would normally be okay with but because it take such a long time to even encounter a player in the game it takes an absurd amount of time to get better and that time isn't fun because it's mainly spent roaming the map without seeing anybody.,Not Recommended

I like this game I really do. Which makes me sad that the Devs are running it into the ground. Adding microtransactions in EARLY ACCESS when the game is in desperate need of optimization and content updates. Plus the overly sensitive Devs that are banning people for the silliest things to keep things baby friendly. The game needs development. Not greed and over zealous bans from Devs who should be have better things to do since they're no longer keeping their word on monthly updates but instead update us with attempts of getting more money from an already successful game.,Not Recommended

It is a shame the game was at its prime and with less hackers during its early days.

"Disclaimer 1st Beginner's perspective.(viewed tons of Guides and Videos before I hopped in since the game lacks a practice/single Player mode to practice and build muscle memory/get used to Keybinds/get comfy with the levels etc.)I'll try to keep it short the Game has three killer factors that made me uninstall it again.1) Tactical Movement vs. Time Pressure vs. Environment vs. Scopes/NoScopeI've played enough FPS Games to know how to move not draw unneeded attention avoid total newbie mistakes etc.So I enjoyed never dying a ""complete and utter n00b"" death for what it's worth and typically survived to the innermost circle xDHOWEVER... While some parts of the Maps allow for tactical movement more often than once I've found myself with a Timer and the border of the white circle pressing in my rear but nothing but an entire open field ahead with 1 2km of ground to cover until at least the next rock.In any other Game I'd be like ""darn that's going to be slow crawl through the foilage to the next Tree"".In PUBG however I only ever saw plain flat desert and (as usual) no Vehicle for the ""I'll take my chances and bet on speed"" approach.And at that moment anyone with a good Scope was easily able to take me down which isn't surprising and I fully expected it to come.Problem is at this point the Game offers no alternatives but sheer luck. Either everyone within a potential firing position is distracted or engaged onto another Target already or I'm dead meat end of story Not even spread bushes to advance to and the time wouldn't allow for such slow movement anyway. Circles are pressing. All the time.At least for me (perferred Play style) it all falls apart at that moment. Environment doesn't provide enough cover vs. Time Pressure.And IMHO the Scopes (considering the typical engagement Ranges and very limited Weapon availability/choices) seem a bit of a Balance killer due to the massive impact they have on the 250+m engagement capabilities.Without scope I couldn't even barely spot any other Player at Ranges where others with x4 or better scopes enjoy easy Firing Solutions making me a sitting and clueless duck with little chance to fight back.Dunno would be neat to have a few Binoculars scattered around everywhere ( Lvl 0 gear found everywhere).2) Audio System and Audio FeedbackThe Game seems exclusively produced for Headsets it seems.I enjoy a quite potent 5.1 Surround System but despite playing on Volume levels &gt way&lt higher than I'd deem comfortable it always felt like the ""Positional Audio"" used by the Game kept falling straight onto its nose.Even perfect case unsilenced Weapons Fire in the distance gave at best a 45deg Sector to identify the direction of the Gunfire.For everything else I was practically playing ""deaf"" which is a huge disadvantage.Plus there's absolutely no indication of how far any own Noise (i.e. Movement on various Ground types) propagates so at all times I could be rumbling around like a deaf Elephant and unknowingly drawing attention.Had plenty of situtations where I got surprised but literally couldn't figure out where to aim reactive fire in time.The result was obviously inevitable )3) Speed of getting killed / Survival Time under fireIn most cases (unless it was an engagement very shortly after the drop) I did due to two to max. three/four hits judging the Game's own feedback for getting hit. With Lvl 2 gear in 100% condition.Combine that with above factors and I basically ended up playing like 10 Minutes tactically moving and getting my gear in order then at some point dying within 2 3sec being engaged from considerable distance. That's not even enough time to take (non existing anyway) cover. So while the idea is interesting the RNG based looting IMHO severely flawed Audio feedback System balancing issues (Scopes) and the often too limited environment in my Opinion can too often and predictably lead to a long looting Phase cool tactical movement parts (some call it walking simulator)... all ending within 2 3 sec in a 100% anticlimactic death xDIn a sense an okay experience but the Tactical shortcomings and reliance on luck while being pushed towards a random Map Center and RNG chances of finding &gt any&lt cover at least to guard some angles from the battlefield really put me off.Disclaimer #2 I'm fully aware this description and assessment comes from a low skill level and I'd probably get better after putting more hours in. No hard feelings and I played it just for fun anyway never cared about ""chicken dinner"" or points or anything else.I simply saw no point in continuing right now since the experience (due to listed limitations) wasn't as fun as I had hoped it'd be. And I don't want to buy a 40"" 4k Display purchase new High Quality Headsets or maybe set all GFX settings on my RX580 to low to increase the likelyhood of picking up those few moving Pixels in the distance eariler while walking/running.",Not Recommended

Thats the worst part instead of crashing its acting like it still is playable but nope you wait for 20 minutes and nothing changes once it freezes.

"Just started playing and I have mixed feelings about this game. On one hand the general set up and atmosphere is really intense and I like it. Also I like the pseudo realistic setting reminds me a bit of playing Operation Flashpoint all those years ago. However from the ""Am I having fun?"" perspective I can't recommend it at the moment. Performance is abysmal in FullHD on an i6700K and a 1070 if you consider that the graphics are functional at best. But the biggest thing making me not having fun is playing for quite some time and then getting shot in the back of the head by someone who had the luck of finding a 4x scope. Yeah if I have a 4x scope the fun is on my side but I would prefer a balanced game allowing for different playstyles than ""Get the sniping equip first"". Forcing people to enter complexes could do the trick since then close combat weapons would make sense. Bottom line kinda fun will keep playing every now and then to see if they fix stuff but not really overwhelmed for my 30 bucks.Also you really have to be up for some hurt like playing for 20 mins collecting stuff and then dieing without having a real clue why.

This is actually a decent game with a lot of potential....What makes it is they let the hackers roam free theres no kind of reprocutions or even anyway to report hackers. So 9 times out of 10 when you confront someone even if you get the drop on them they shoot once and of course its headshot (even if they arent looking at you or even have their gun out).

Now the game WAS good in my opinion and I feel like the community loved it and that it was what they wanted you had fast action and you also had decent time. Sure it wasn't optimized but it was acceptable due to it just coming out. Then I took a break from the game to play some other games but in that time they managed to make the community worse and the game doesn't feel like it does anymore. It isn't anymore optimized it might actually be worse at least out of personal experience. Also I feel like the new wave of hackers needs to be dealt with before the game gets updated with new maps or guns and they shouldn't ban left and right for no reason as I highly doubt everyone they ban has really stream sniped. I feel at this point even if they fixed things the community would still be toxic about this event.,Not Recommended

Chicken Dinners are mighty tasty Cosmetics such as gas masks or general clothing do NOT clip and actually change the shape of the cosmetic based on what you're wearing say a level 3 helmet and a gas mask the gas mask will have a different shape so as not to clip into the level 3 helmet.Terrible Things.

Buggy as complete hell (Not always a bad thing) Cars. LOADING. The game even on SSD has trouble loading and rendering buildings allowing people to look into buildings using first person view grabbing weapons through walls shooting through walls etc. Hence why the developer should be putting every second he can into optimization before any other stupid Game is fun. Worth the price? Maybe. With the amount of bugs in it? Definitely not wait until PlayerUnknown realizes how terribly optimized his game is.(UPDATE)Game has become more optimized but nowhere near the ""1.0"" mark they should be shooting for.

Infested with hackers/cheaters.Server tickrate and overall optimization still sucks.Developers won't fix anything that is actually wrong and insist just on adding more cosmetic items/emotes and LOOTBOXES instead of balancing or optimising the game.you will drop in an obscure location look around you see no one with you in the air then get shot in the face within 20 seconds. coz someone apparently was there.edit and now they have removed server selection and got rid of oceanic servers too so now everyone in Oceana has a minimum ping of 150 and thats a rare good ping now... how is this acceptable for a game in 2018? the ping basically locks the entire oceanic region out of playing the game. good job bluehole. you money grabbing POS.ESPORTS READY. ha this game isn't even 1.0 ready. still.,Not Recommended

you can't just make a paid game like this. 2/3 times I try to play it says servers are topo busy. why do you make people pay for this game while it doesn't even load,Not Recommended
This Is a great game great idea... except for connection issues. every other game I own runs just fine online but when it comes to puk bg it just has so many issues when trying to enter the game I have great internet and a solid personally built compuer but no mater what there are issues when trying to enter the game initially or trying to enter a match Ive had things happen where it just freezes on the loading screan until im almost hitting the ground and habe thenworst position to not loading at all then theres the issue that once you land the buildings do not load despite the map never changing I've owned the game for three or four months and still no changes it only gets worse it actually ran better when it first came out. this game is not worth the money they are charging for it anymore and with the money they have made you would think they would have improved on this but alas there seems to be no hope for improvement. I'm just about done with dealing with it. not worth the money there are plenty of games similar that you can get that don't have these issues and have other game modes.,Not Recommended
Haven t played a crap ton of hours but based on what I have played this game needs a lot of work. Bugs desync (caused by poor netcode) poor anti cheat software and the below average performance just litter this game has and will make you rage at times. And no I don t have bad internet (100+Mbps). You can sometimes spray a full mag right with your sights right at an enemy and just not kill them. Alternitavly you could be in the end game just to be killed by a hacker halfway across the map wasting 20 minutes of your time. The new Fix PUBG is a step in the right direction but from what I ve seen soo far nothing has really been fixed that is major. The sounds controls and graphics are all average.On the plus side getting to the top 10 is very exciting filling you with an adrenaline rush and playing with friends can be fun if the servers aren t acting up that day. And getting that winner winner chicken dinner is a nice way to end that gaming session.The general gameplay is by nature reliant on luck but skilled players can still consistently win. But the odds are always against you as you have to survive out of 100 players so don t expect to win most of your games.The gun physics are different compared to most games. This game favors ADS (Aiming Down Sights) compared to using crosshairs. Just if you came from a game from Counter Strike like me prepare to use this functionality a lot more frequently. There is also bullet drop and velocity which adds a whole new aspect to combat especially long range combat and gives the game a higher skill ceiling.An addition to the main game I would like to see is maybe a sandbox mode or something to help improve predicting bullet drop/ velocity at range.To conclude if you want this game really bad or have friends that play this game hardcore buy it. You will have lots of fun. Just know that you will experience a bunch of glitches and bugs that can ruin your experience. But to the unsure buyer or the one who is looking to buy their next game but doesn t have lots of money to spend skip this game for now. If the devs do however fix all their major problems with this game I am willing to change my review but I don t see that happening anytime soon. Just make this game worth the money please.,Not Recommended

When the game works it's fun but that's such a small % of the time that it's not worth buying it. Even now after 'Fix PUBG' was supposedly completed the game is a joke of a mess. Sometimes you'll connect to a game just for it to say that it's timed out the only way for you to be able to connect to games now is to restart the game. Sometimes you'll get into a game and it'll crash as soon as you land your parachute. Hope you like restarting the game! Even IF you manage to connect to a game and IF it doesn't crash best hope the servers feel like offering you a stable connection! 50Mbps internet? Lol good one here's some stuttering and desync. Add on top of the the optimisation that was done by a ing idiot and even with an i7 and a 980Ti good luck getting a solid 60FPS at 1440p. All in all it's not worth the frustration of actually trying to play a game.,Not Recommended

Jump back a year ago and this was a game with issues here and there but otherwise filled with the potential for one of the best shooters out there. I've had a lot of fond memories with this game as well but recently it has been getting increasingly frustrating.Optimisation has somehow been getting increasingly worse with each version. Places like Rozhok that once ran smooth as butter on medium to high now run at choppy frame rates on low. Several bugs are still present in the game that still haven't been fixed or publicly acknowledged.Servers have been getting significantly worse. Sometimes you can't be matched into a game without refreshing it sometimes you'll get in but your mate won't.Paid lootcrates. Why are paid crates rolled in the same category as regular crates. You spend several games building up enough BP to get a random crate which is then locked behind an obligatory $2.50 purchasable key. What's worse is that these payments are the only way to get a large amount of in game visual cosmetics.Between the increasingly poor performacne deteriorating servers and paid lootcrates it's almost mind boggling to believe that this is the game that topped steam sales and most people online for a significant amount of time last year. A real shame for something that was really fun and hyped not so long ago.,Not Recommended

This game reminds me of Ark. When I first saw it when it released in early access I thought it was a cool game. I go ahead buy the game and appreciate it even though there are lots of bugs because devs sound caring about their game. Over time not much gets fixed except graphics. Devs start caring less about game and more about money and add microtransactions and/or DLC even before the game is near finished. Game stays crap for years. Devs announce official release of game. Game still sucks after 1.0 update. People start realizing devs aren't going to fix the game even when devs say they are. People leave. Game slowly dies. Eventually only hardcore fans of the game are left. The end.,Not Recommended

This game had the most potential of any video game I had ever seen. The first day I got this I got completely lost in it and played for over 12 consecutive hours. Even the bugs in the game added a little bit of charm to the game.However the devs somehow managed to shoot themselves in the foot over and over and over again. They constantly add new features that nobody asked for while neglecting to fix game breaking bugs that have been in the game since day one. This game is an unoptimized ugly choppy broken mess that I could maybe justify playing if it was free.As is this game has no redeeming qualities and shows no signs of improving. Please do yourself a favor and save the money. Do not support these devs.,Not Recommended
Absolutely don't buy this pathetic game right now.The concept is great it delivers its own great style and identity that I love and is actually a lot of fun.However I can't help but believe the development team is headed by greedy out of touch morons. They ignore the easiest to fix for absolutely patheticly long periods of time. Your head goes in front of the camera all the time.Movement is bizarre the FP camera does not feel right.Everyone is rubberbanding all over the place netcode is lazy.Can't select a default game mode.Gun goes awkwardly up in your face when near a wall.Optimization is terrible can't seem to run well for anybody.Sound is ed beyond belief gunshots seem to change directions rapidly.On top of all that (not all of the problems) the game crashes all the time.Don't give these lazy untalented idiots any more money until their game actually improves.,Not Recommended

The reason I gave this game a thumbs down is because the way the game is heading. If you like being good at Call of Duty and getting desync issues to give some trash players a chance this is for you. Before the 1.0 update there were no problems with that. But now if you want to be good at this game you either have to be a twitch streamer or someone who hasn't logged over 50 hours. The amount of favoritism in this game.... is ing disgusting. Bluehole must've figured if they can get new players to say it's fun at the same time having streamers record super fun looking gameplay then there will be no more profit for them. This isn't battle royale. This is ing greed fest ultra beyond what treyarch and activision could ever imagine.

1 Dullest battle royale game in the market only two things hold this game up the battle royale concept and being able to play with friends which are bare minimum for the genre.2 99% of the time you run and hide and that is the only factor that makes the shooting part exciting because it makes the rest 1% of the time you spend in dull shooting feel like heaven after all the waiting and sprinting. Even jumping in a crowded area people will hide like cockroaches and try to listen your footsteps.3 Absolute garbage optimisation and low performance for dirt ugly graphics. (edit) 3.5 Originality and creativity is NON EXISTANT in PUBG. It's just 100 people play hide and seek in a desolate 2000 era graphics map where nothing happens 0 events 0 quests.4 Shooting is plain and simple. Calling it realistic would be the best compliment but it s not realistic. It s not balanced either.5 Weapon balance is awful. It s clear as day developers cannot decide if they want to implement a realistic damage and bullet physics or fun damage and bullet physics. 6 Camping like a rotten corpse wins you the game while running around and fighting is fun but you get killed easier.7 Laggy foreign players who will shoot you through corners because the game favors the shooter no matter the lag.8 Great example of how indie developers can succumb to greed and create lootbox system on a 30$ a pop game.Verdict 1 out of 10 for battle royale games.

Hello I've been a PUBG player for some time now. I am in several Discord servers dedicated to PUBG and I played almost everyday. I have loved this game since it's launch. But recently I've seen a huge influx of negative reviews. A lot of them are quite accurate I hate to say. Unoptimization vehicles and network issues are most of the complaints. I can attest to most of this. I've experienced a lot of issues with PUBG before but I still enjoy the game. But is it too late to turn back and make PUBG great again? Is it too late to bring back the player base? What if the new map doesn't bring back players. Just my thoughts and I wanted to see if anyone else is thinking the same thing. I would love to hear what everyone else thinks. We're getting closer and closer to PUBG's demise if the developers don't fix these issues. Can we have confirmation that the developers will work on making the game better and actually fixing these issues?,Not Recommended

So this is a paid game that locks the loot you get after each match. To unlock it you need to buy individual keys that cost 2 19 euros each. This from a game that supposedly made millions. Not fixing bugs not improving their product. Their first order of business after launch was to implement this crap. Sounds fun to you?Second problem is more a genre problem than a pugb problem. It's basic common sense. When you play something in the lines of COD with 10 vs 10 matches if you have 1000 concurent players where 10% are cheaters some matches will have cheaters some will be good. On something like Battlefield matches have way more people but because of the objective based nature and diferent skirmishes going on in a single map you can still dodge the cheaters after you identify them. But on something like pugb a battle royalle... the same pool of 1000 with 10% cheaters (100) will be divided in 100 men matches. There will be a lot less matches with the same pool of players andchances for each and every one of them having some of those 10% cheaters increase tremendously. Add to that the battle royalle mechanics where only 1 wins and you have no way to dodge that one cheater in your 100 men match. Bottom line in pugb getting to the last 10 is finding the cheaters. Is this cheap brain dead 1 vs all game where every match you do nothing but running around for 15/20 minutes to get to a 30 second fire fight against a hand full of the surviving cheaters and campers of each match(then rinse and repeat all over again) the new shooter genre nirvana? Seriously though how low can a genre get?,Not Recommended
After playing PUBG on my Android phone for about six months and liking it I thought the PC version would be a winner. Wrong! The mobile version is way more fun (better menu system and more intuitive controls) but more importantly runs much better. The PC Steam version is sooo glitchy. Most times I end up stuck in the air floating on a parachute and not able to even land on the ground. I have a few clips of this.Also you need a top spec PC to really run this game. In my opinion the minimum specified 8GB is not enough. Also you will need a super fast internet connection or there really is no point buying this game! My internet connection is pretty decent but was getting a lot of lag anyway.Going back to the mobile version you can use settings to automatically pick up a specified amount of items. So for example you can set it so that you pick up 250 rounds of a specified type of ammo. All you do is run/walk over the ammo and you automatically pick it up. Once you get to the specified number you wont pick up any more. You can do this with med kits cans etc. In this version you have to individually point to and pick up items (by pressing a button). This makes game play really tedious and takes away the fun. Developers! Another point in the mobile version you get little footprints appearing on the map when you hear an enemy approaching. This is useful as you can home in on direction easily making game play more fluid. Your team mates' footsteps will not appear on the map in this way. Also useful. In the Steam version there is no way to tell which audible footsteps are whose meaning you have to focus a lot more. I think this makes it less fun. Leave all that tactical stuff to Tom Clancy. The same applies to gunshots in the mobile version your enemy's gunshots are marked on the map giving you a rough direction (unless they are using a supressor). Developers!One more thing you will get head shot ed through a wall by someone using botware (cheating!). I think they are now trying to clamp down on cheats but there are still loads for sure! This does not really bother me that much. What does bother me is the numerous glitches and tedious game play!As other people have said this has a lot of potential. Good graphics good sounds smooth action (when it actually works) nice concept etc. As of right now however I would like a refund and to uninstall this lame duck of a game. Stick to the much better PUBG mobile on android. Try it you will see what I mean.,Not Recommended

I love PUBG. The game is still fun sometimes. This game has such unique gunplay and the satisfaction of getting a kill in a game like this is fantastic.It's so unfortunate that this game is being completely mismanaged. This game costs $30 and I do not regret spending that money but the game's microtransactions are horrible. No you do not have to buy the skins however that's the only thing you can work towards in this game. Over half the crates that you can buy with the in game currency cost real money to open. You can't even trade the skins anymore which kept the CS GO community alive for years. They introduced an event pass that costs money and gives players something to work towards but if you don't pay money nearly all of the rewards are temporary and the rate at which you earn XP (f you don't pay) is stupidly slow.If we ignore the MTX's the game is still broken at a fundamental level. The game still has a rediculous number of hackers and the networking for this game is unacceptable for a game that has made over $700 million dollars and has been out of early access for 7 months. The amount of desync especially in highly populated areas will have you tearing out your hair after you get killed even after ducking behind a wall. For the 8th time in a row. Or picture a shotgun battle where you land a shot at point blank range before your enemy shoots on your screen but then you die you realize that the game never even registered your shot. And let's not even talk about the frame drops that are still happening in close quarter fights and in urban areas (where it matters most).My recommendation is to save your money. Go preorder/buy Battlefield 5 or go play Fortnite. You'll pay $60 for BFV but have meaningful progression multiple game modes and be able to play on servers that aren't a bag of potatoes. Fortnite will give you a better quality experience and its FREE. At this rate this game doesn't have much time left.,Not Recommended

I apologize in advance to anyone who this may upset but I absolutely cannot justify giving this game a positive review. I love the idea of the game being based off of a Japanese film where students are dropped off at an island and the last one standing wins.

If you're remotely interested in playing this game just don't go play fortnite instead for free and to be honest I don't even like fortnite but it's still better than being scammed.Update COD Blackout is actually good much better than pubg and actually runs well.

And im saying this is true because I got shot by someone really close atleast 5 bullets went into me and did not make my health go down at all.

Good game concept but the combat is really ed up in my opinion sometimes it works perfectly fine sometimes you are just oneshot or the enemy even though you have full euqipment and sometimes enemies simply wont die even after 15 hits or u simply dont hit em even though you are clearly on point. I dont recommend buying the game if i hadnt played more than 2 hours already i would have refunded but its too late now. ( I want my money back. If you want to read more about the game just read the comments below this review.... forgot you can edit reviews.,Not Recommended
This game has great gunplay. The shooting feels fair and most weapons are balanced fairly well. The revolver could use the ability to attach a scope to it to make it a little more viable and the Silencer feels a little too strong at the moment with literally no repercussions for putting it on but minor complaints. My major problems come everywhere else in this game. The unit collision is so bad i dont have words for it. Vehicles can hit what looks to be nothing and go flying in the air. You bump into a team mate while running and you come to a complete stop. If you try to raid a house you and your friend will more often then not get stuck on each other trying to go in because the hit boxes are terrible. The De sync issues are so bad it makes the game borderline unplayable most days. Server lag has only gotten worse since launch. The Blue zone moves way too soon and hits way too hard too soon. It pushes players to the center way too soon and I find myself running from the zone more then trying to engage other players. All of this on top of the well known FPS issues. Overall I think this game has potential to be great it just has a lot of very glaring issues that make it incredibly frusterating. It has a bright future with the rate updates are rolling out But i just dont think its worth the money at this moment.,Not Recommended

The game conccept is in the battle royale genre where the last survivor/pair/team standing wins.It can be similar to CS GO in the way where every match is basicaly the same you have to do the same stuff over and over again. I find games like these(Battle Royale) to be enjoyable until you reach 10 20 hours than it really gets overburned(like H1Z1).+ This game was poorly optimised for my 280X+i5 4th gen.Regreted every single penny I've dumped into it glad I got to refund it quickly. May give another try in like a year or so if this game isn't dead by then(like The Curling and I guess H1Z1 talking about active players) or if I get payed one.,Not Recommended

It can be a fun game it has good graphics decent idea great map yet the fun element is usually not there after you die after 20 minutes of passive gameplay not even knowing where you are getting shot from. There is so little indication of where the enemy is attacking you from and you die so quickly for super long rounds to just die unfairly the majority of the time is not entertaining to say the least. The jumping mechanism is a bit glitchy and vaulting needs to be added ASAP (I know it is being worked upon). The smallest of walls cannot be jumped over without a run up.

Plauged with bugs and hackers (And now now I can't even play because I have VMWare running in the background. Freaking joke.

You would assume that because PlayerUnknown is now offering microtransactions and tournaments that they have fixed their major server issues. You would also be mistaken. My PC can run the Wticher 3 on ultra and keep up with the multitude of online games I play but around half the time I can't load into a game of PUBG. Purely ridiculous. Trying to play with friends is also nearly impossible because almost every match someone is going to crash or lag out. For how fun this game could be it is incredibly frusturating to have to keep dealing with these same issues update after update. Honestly I would be much more understanding of an Early Access title if they weren't already moving towards tournaments because to me that signals that the game is complete. If it works this game is incredibly fun and enjoyable but unfortunately the if is way too large. And for that reason I can't recommend this game right now.,Not Recommended

Love the game play and the concept but cannot recommend the game due to the incessent &amp blatant hacking..

Updates are about revenue than fixing anything. Games always been buggy but when its in Alpha or even Beta its expected. But to think they released this fully when it should still be in Beta is beyond me.They've even gone as far as to force you to play their map because they fear the player base is dropping so fast it wont function with a proper map select.

This game is littered with chinese hackers and laggers who bluehole wont do anything about because that would be offensive. They also wont stop selling their real money crates which is helping drive the demand for cheaters to use hacks to gain more BP. They just want more money. The tick rate is awful and hits often just dont register even when on your screen they are pouring out blood on their screen they lose 10 health. With the low tick rate laggers can kill you where you were a long time ago meanwhile they warp around and hits on them dont register till youre dead and then the damage is deleted because you are dead,Not Recommended

This is the worst game that I have ever played. Yet it had huge potenial and so I gave it every chance I could. The maker of the game fell flat on it's nose at every turn. Clearly making it obvious that it was not concerned with the game over the long haul but instead allowed cheaters to run rampant which in part is due to the in game clothing line that can be purchased for ingame money or real world money. So Chinese hackers where allowed to ruin the game so that the company could make money on people buying the clothing items online at places like ebay from the hackers who did not earn them. And then they allowed cheaters who were bad enough at it to get caught and banned to simply buy game again with a different account. It's a sham and theft in the purest form.,Not Recommended
Let me start of by this. the game devs banned me for nothing I do not hack and did not use reshade. they said all the dev bans are automated. look this was my favorite game but now i feel robbed. not to mention I have a gameban that I did not deserve at all. not to mention this game has tons of crappy bugs and blackscreens. this should have never been released it feels like early access days. im never playing this game again blue hole are rich now cause of microsoft and they dont care that when you buy this game you get banned. they are a holes with no sense of thought of oh this guy paid with his own money and supported this game since day one. pitty on you devs you stole my game I purchased and run away with my money laughing. well fortnite is beating you now have fun.,Not Recommended

Played this game since beta and it was passable then. As an OC player I've either faced overly long matchmaking waits or moved to another server and had to deal with extreme latency.

I have more than 500 hours playing this game but let me say I'm quiting playing it since 90% of the times I die is because of hackers and cheaters using macros or external software. They don't even care to show to everytone that they are hacking since the game's admin won't do a thing.From my end I tried evetything to avoid hackers but it's just impossible... Even creating a ticket on their website won't solve anything. I have a couple of tickets with videos with death cams and nothing was done so far.It's jsut sad seeing such a good game going to waste.

Defining the Battle Royale Genre. As we approach a new year a fresh trend enters the established medium of gaming Battle Royale. PUBG is the catalyst for this uproar being responsible for spawning even newer titles (or changes) such as Fortnite Rules of Survival and the H1Z1 controversy. + The Pros Vehicles Out of all the battle royale games that have been released thus far this has the widest variety of vehicles to choose from all with their own upsides and downsides. Granted control whilst driving can be a chore (or unfair sometimes) but otherwise it's satisfying to use.Gunplay Once again PUBG has the best gun control that any battle royale game has to offer. Not only that but I'd argue that it's gunplay is more effecient than other FPS focused titles in the industry. Replayability This game can be out right addicting and it never seems to disappoint me every round I play (with some exceptions). With friends it's only more enjoyable. So if you're searching for long term investments for any particular game this is a must have in your wishlist. The Cons Hackers Although I do believe that players have exaggerated this issue it still maintains its relevance in the general experience. Throughout the pros I mentioned that most of the rounds I encountered were enjoyable and engaging. Suffice to say the exceptions to that consistency is this particular issue.Variety If this game was still in Early Access I wouldn't have pointed this out. However PUBG recently released a full release with a major update that enhances its graphics and optimization. On one hand the optimization issue that was profound in the previous version is adjusted. On the other hand the variety in maps and weaponry still feel somewhat lacking. For a $30 game there should be more content. That's not to say that the rest of the gameplay doesn't make up for these glaring flaws. Final Verdict Whether you hate or enjoy the Battle Royale genre I would recommend anyone this game. There's a lot of enjoyment that can be had with this game especially with friends.EDIT This review is outdated due to recent business practices. (I.E Microtransactions Slow Development Dishonest Developers etc. etc.),Not Recommended
I have one simple question. Why do people still play this game when it is still broken? I have 200 hours in this game and i finally decided that its time to uninstall. I understand that this game is still in early access so they are to fix most of the issues. But if they really cared about the game they wouldn't be trying to squeeze every dime they can by spending all their time on making invitationals for the game rather than FIXING THE GAME. It's been 3 months since i have purchased the game and they have yet to fix any problems with the game. Everything still is so messed up. The gunplay is awful and is never consistent. Just youtube video's of the game and i garuntee you will find more videos of the game being broken than it working correctly. I mean hell Just watch their first invintational and it was broken then. Its a sick joke that we spend $30 on an early access game to begin with and they dont even have the respect to fix its main issues before making compititions for money..

This game has become like Pokemon go. Remember the original craze people playing the game obsessively the extensive media covreage the hype. Pokemon go's player base shrunk very quickly after launch due to server side issues stability scalability and stangnating game play. Sound familiar PUBG fans.Development on this PC version of this game has slowed to a crawl. Work on the game has shifted focus to the XBox release of the game most likely canabalizing their existing core team to port the game. The game publisher could not resist the money Microsoft were prepared to throw at them for an exclusive title to lift up their stagnating platform.Due to the poor architecture and implementation of the game (poor performance and buggy) it has now become inundated with cheaters. Anti cheat functionality was not implemented as a core part of the game and they relied too heavily on a third party anti cheat detection system to save them from the bad guys. It would be like Microsoft creating Windows OS but not hardening their code against exploits with the naive belief that the anti virus software of the day will keep their customers safe. Exploit prevention and exploit detection are two differnt things. Exploit detection systems only work after your system has been compomised often too late after the damage has been done.Based on the very sparse amount of information coming out of Bluehole their abyismal community engagement and management you cetainly get the sense that there does not appear to be a long term strategy to build a long lasting community platform around PUBG. If one was to interpret Blueholes actions to date it appears they are mainly focused on maximizing profits in the short term while investing as little as possbile in the long term and minimizing risk to their bottom line. They even split off the game into a seperate corporation PUBG Corp away from the parent corporation Bluehole. Perhaps to firewall themselves off from liability and creditors once pubg eventually crashes and burns.I also get the sense from the big Twitch streaming personalities that interest in the game is waning. Where in the recent past Twitch streamers were streaming PUBG as their primary focus they are now actively moving on to other games and streaming PUBG less and less.TLDRPUBG has helped define a new Genre in video games that is here to stay thanks PUBG. Unfortuantely I don't think PUBG as a title has any legs and will not live long enough to reach maturity and will quickly die during it's adolesence most likey due to a crash involving some three wheeled motorcycle.,Not Recommended

This comapny can't even get the maintence time correct having to push it back 3 hrs every time. Rather then fix problems that they know exist they would rather make cosmetic crates. Rather then region lock or ping lock the game they would rather call you xenophobic despite them coming out and saying where the cheats are coming from. Do not buy.

At the time of this review January 1 2018 I cannot recommend this game. Since the 1.0 launch PUBG has been dealing with an influx of hackers and Chinese server hopping to the US. 99% of the hackers you see will have Chinese names. Those from China that aren't hacking are desynced so badly that they begin teleporting around not taking damage or landing shots on you from behind cover. This can especially be seen from 2am est to 7am est. The new death Cam and replay features are great in the fact that you can see who is willing using no recoil etc. My team just played 4 games where we were completely decimated by hackers who weren't running armor or helmets with only 30 or so people left. The replays show the shots not having any effect on the guys while they twitch to each of our heads. I refuse to play this game until R E G I O N L O C K is a thing. It will help mitigate US players from having to deal with desync and will lower the amount of hacking US players will have to deal with.,Not Recommended

Let me start of by saying this game is a blast. It's fun by yourself. It's more fun with friends.And it's the best battle royal style game out right now.You just have to have a yolo mentality and have fun with it. If you are trying to take it seriously and get mad easily then this isn't the game for you. It's good for one offs for 15 30mins at a time you can binge but if you get frustrated easily then you won't have fun.I have a blast playing this.BUTThere are currently issues that escalated (in my opinion) after PUBG passed DOTA 2 for most concurrent players online at once. First of all the servers went to from 9am noon EST it's basically imposible to play due to servers getting flooded with people. I don't think the devs expected to have this many players on at once and I don't blame them. I expected this game to just be another game that will never leave alpha but after such a good reception I have hope.Second if you look at any top comments you'll see that the devs will ban anyone accused of stream sniping or trolling streamers. They aren't joking or blowing it out of proportion they cater to streamers and will ban as fast as they can report you. Of couse it's BS beacaue the odds of you joining a match with a streamer that you can find in game is almost 0%. But whatever.Also there is a ridiculous amount of chinese spam. On the discussion page in matches just screaming moon speak at everyone. It's ear spliting and awfull.But honestly if the servers were fixed this would be a recommended review.

Product received for free. Pubg is a heavily influential game. This cannot be denied due to how it popularized the BR genre. However Pubg is so poorly optimized that I cannot recommend it.

"Cpu 3570k Gpu gtx970 Internet connection 10Mb download 2Mb upload Very consistent ping (to google) of around 30msIt sems to ridiculous that I have played so much of this game. It started with wonderful potential. It had a incredible feeling of tension and catharsis and all of the buggs were forgiven because it gave such a unique and powerful immersion. I played enough to get addicted to that feeling. There is nothing like the sensation of a chicken dinner (which means a win for the uninitiated). Especially a hard fought chicken dinner. Through all of the frustrations I have found two facets of combat that are ruining the gameplay for me. Both relate to the fact that all desync and bugginess seems to be amplified during combat. My skill (which is fair to middlin') only applies a small percentage of the time. Half of the time combat goes something like this I will fire two headshots at somebody facing the opposite direction. After I fire the two shots I die then I hear his shots then I see him turn around to fire at me. In these cases I had no chance other than to hide in the grass until the end of the game. MORE important this kind of problem is the opposite side of combat. I no longer feel good about my successful combat becuase I can see the elements of desync from my opponent. Someone will be aimed down sights at me for 3 seconds their head peeked around cover and not fire a shot. I will have time to stop running aim fire 2 missed shots and then kill him. I don't feel good about winning these fights and they are more and more predominent. Even more messed up is the fact that I play this as a way of hanging out with some friends. They don't see what I see or they choose to ignore. I WOULD RATHER PLAY GAMES ALONE THEN HAVE PLAY THIS GAME WITH FRIENDS. I try to play with them and I immediately get salty. I can't help but get frustrated when the entire game is looting for 20 minutes and finding nothing running for 10 minutes and then experiencing the combat that I've detailed above. Granted I have the option of always dropping in a populated area but the poor gameplay is much worse in the beginning and so I skip the first two steps and just die outright. The release of the ""Savage"" map gave me hope. It was far less buggy (ironically test servers seem to function better) and the presence of loot made the game playable. When the test period ended I went back to getting Miramar (large desert map) which is awful in comparison. We drop in one of the bigger towns (El Pozo) and loot for ten minutes. Three of us find one M16 two shotguns and only two vests and a helmet between us. I admit that this was an especially bad example. If 90 percent of the game is going to be searching for a lobby waiting for the plane parachuting out of the plane failing to find a gun in more than a dozen locations and running to the bluezone (while avoiding the redzone) then the other 10% (combat) NEEDS TO BE CLEAN! After several years and and million of sales they show no signs of fixing it. If they fix the desync and make this game playable (bluezone inhibits combat more often then encourages it there is no loot and lagggggggggg) I will give this game a 9/10. Right now it can't be properly rated because it never graduated into being a full game it is still a buggy demo.",Not Recommended
Simply put this game's netcode is absolutely horrendous. You will be killed by latency. 16hz is unacceptable and it makes this game's core gameplay loop unfair and imbalanced. I do not recommend playing this until the developers increase the server tick frequency to 60hz. It's supposed to be competitive and it can't be if players are all experiencing desynchronized experiences. 3/10. Seriously there's no reason to buy a game that performs (in every possible category) worse than free games. Radical Heights F BR hell COD at this point is a superior gameplay experience. Fix the game I'll play the out of it and recommend it.,Not Recommended

PUBG was a lot of fun initially but continual issues... cheating bugs and server connectivity has left a lot of people disappointed. My friends lists were always lit up with people playing PUBG... not anymore. I never tried playing Fortnite but today I started playing CoD Blackout which I bought specifically for the Battle Royale. It's very similar to PUBG but a much more enjoyable experience because it does everything its supposed to do. So far my impression is that the game community is largely a migration of former PUBG players rather than the abusive little punks which CoD has a reputation for. I do prefer the PUBG style and find it a much more imaginable and relatable theme as opposed to the more military style of Blackout. It's far more expensive than PUBG but you kind of get the quality you pay for when comparing the two especially when considering that I haven't been able to load a PUBG game at all recently due to poor region management. Regardless of future updates and dev reassurances PUBG has suffered reputation damage beyond repair and it will not be able to keep pace with competitors. The best thing about PUBG? I made three times the games value through selling loot in the STEAM marketplace. If you enjoy PUBG but are over the disappointment give Blackops a go.,Not Recommended

So i wasted money on items on this game and i wasted the 30 bucks for this that,Not Recommended
The core concept of the game is very fun and addicting winning gives you a rush you have never felt in a game before. In the current state however I can not recommend the game.Performance is hit or miss with every patch. Did I gain FPS or lost some? The game runs somewhat stable on i5 4690k 4.4 GHz 1070 GTX 16 GB RAM but I still get massive framedrops every few minutes.You never know what killed you. Was it a glitch was it a hacker was it just desync from the bad netcode? The lack of a shooting range or kill cam makes it very hard to get better at the game.Additionally there are questionable descisions being made by the developers. Resetting of your game mode (mainly Solo FPP) after every match hasn't been fixed since the release of FPP + your server resetting after the latest monthly patch. Post processing being forced on everyone because they couldn't fix a bug on the new fog map so they rather deploy it with a workaround. Don't get me started on the whole stream sniping controversy.I will try this game again after the next patch and see if there are any improvements but until then I would not buy this game.Update for 1.0 Insane rubberbanding in the beginning. Loot still spawns in late. Still couldn't fix that your previous selection of FPP/TPP gets carried over. Performance got a bit better.Update from July 2018 Game still runs like,Not Recommended

Why does bluepoint want everyone to pay MORE real money on keys to unlock crates that shouldnt need that. I have over 20 different crates that require keys and im sick of it. I bought keys in the past and i realized very fast that its a total waste of money. The crates before desperado crates did not require keys and I got the same stuff why should i pay real money now to get the same junk? I will not be buying any more keys because I shouldn't have to. This is worse that any other game that I know of practically stealing money from us just so that we can win clothing in a game that isn't real.

If someone asked my opinion on PUBG when it was first launched(as EA) I would've recommended the game no questions asked. PUBG managed to score the golden zone in terms of FPS action player growth and tense drama. It left me with many fond memories playing both solo and with friends.However in the current state of the game I'm afraid it is very difficult to recommend the game to anyone. The reason being mainly hackers. You WILL meet them. And in a game where it is so difficult to get results the feeling you get when you are playing in a game where you actually have a chance to score 1st and discover someone is walking faster than a car at full speed and headshoting everyone from 150m with an SMG is just... very discouraging.There is just no excuse for this kind of service in a game that sold this well. Along with breaking promises of not monetizing the game pre launch as well as updates which come at the speed of which a cherry blossom petal falls from it's tree it is a very depressing thing to see when a company fails to invest properly in their success and takes the easy road of greed.If you are wondering if you should jump in the wagon now you shouldn't.,Not Recommended

"Ok I'm done. I was just killed by a guy who I emptied an entire mag into who just shruged it off and one shot me with a shotgun. The worst part is this is not the first time. I love this game to death but I cannot recommend it. I only play it for the memes.The lag is abysmal even after a year of patches and promises to fix it. It doesn't help that the developers refuse to talk about the Chinese players who play on western servers creating a laggy experience for eveyone (paragraph about the cheaters below). Instead of fixing this problem the developers label people who ask for it to be fixed as ""racists"" to ignore the problem. I don't think they care anymore. I don't think they'll fix it. Oh btw they've been going through reviews and removing them because they're ""against the community guidelines"". What a joke.It's not like they really do anything about the cheaters either. You can see them on the leaderboards so the devs have the info they need. They just don't do anything about it. According to the operators of the game's anti cheat 99% of banned cheaters come from China (link below to an IGN article). Now I don't promote region locking. It won't work because of VPNs and there are a lot of legitimate Chinese players who are a joy to play with in squads but that's too high for any decent game that wants to own the genre.This game and the people who ""develop"" it is so incompetant that I am very close to quitting it. I'm writing this review to appeal to the developers who can't quite seem to understand why their competitors are outclassing them and to anyone who considers buying PUBG. This game is still early access and you shouldn't purchase it.The core game is brilliant which makes this situation even sadder. You know how it works already there's no point describing it. The problem is even the brilliant base isn't that solid anymore. The develpers get angry when other competitors imitate them and are suing because an app because it uses fryingpans like PUBG. Yeah they ripped you off but good luck arguing that point in court.If ""PUBG Corp"" (formally Bluehole) want people to play their game then they need to fix their problems and stop launching legal actions against other developers. Regardless of whether they're ripping you off they don't have the cheaters you do. The latest update has lowered the broken lag issues a bit and the upcoming Savage map is a dream to play. I am still excited for this game's future but it's a long way from being worthy of your $30 when there are free experineces that are less broken (looking at you Fortnite). The lootcrates are pretty bad and the gambling scene it created is terrible. Thankfully the developers are working to resolve this. After 8 months of allowing it to continue.You are not on top of the genre anymore PUBG Corp. Fortnite is and it deserves to be because it's nowhere near as broken in it's 'Early Access"" state as PUBG is in it's ""Full release"". You are becoming arrogant possibly jealous of Epic's success and it really shows in the often sporadic nature that you conduct yourselves. Your Esports scene will go nowhere as long as your servers are broken and people will continue to leave every day. Fix your game and you will find that people come back. Until then you're beyond a joke to me. Maybe you'll fix things once you realise you're quickly becoming the next H1Z1. I'm sorry to be harsh to people who have made a game I have gotten hours of enjoyment out of but I feel like you only care about the money now.",Not Recommended
"Far too much of this game is based on random chance what I mean by that is on your screen you shot the guy first on the server you did not you missed he heard your shot he now sees you he turns and shoots you once with a shotgun and you die. Even though you shot him two or three times first with your shotgun in the chest that is where you aimed you did not because there servers are so bad you actually hit him only once in the hand and he took almost no damage. This game has a great concept derived from the Japanese movie ""Battle Royale"" but it seems the programmers just aren t good enough to make this a ""playable"" game. I bought this game because it was a great concept with the hopes that it would one day be good. This has not come to be and I cannot recommend it to anyone unless you enjoy getting very frustrated.",Not Recommended

This game has been fun and enjoyable during the early stages good features and effects. Not really much negativity to tell... well till 1.0 was released.You got a large influx of cheaters on 90% of the games you play. Developers removed and changed the stage their game used to be at its pristine ( in my own opinion) Removal of weather day of time effects and breaking of their current network coding and coding in general. There's a lot more issues of your shots being registered when you're shooting somebody. Picking up objects or waiting them to render in can also happen occasionally. Personally i think the biggest issue of them all that it feels mostly all what happens in game is relevant what happens on your client. I.e the server relies on your client side data to confirm whether you actually shot somebody or got shot first before you'd get to kill the opponent. Never ending issue what has felt has been the hackers running rampant. Bluehole notes about this problem but leaving it aside as a 'minority' while pressing forward news wise what they consider more important New loot boxes new cosmetics. Which you can achieve with a 2.05 keys.,Not Recommended

Honestly I'd say avoid this game now the business model and behavior of the dev's is unforgivable and extremly unprofessional.

It's an excuse) Inexperienced developers The last update broke the game and servers for 2 days. The update was also 5gb in size and it added a new gun and first person only servers? How is that 5gb. This is what happens every update. Developers breaking promises (if they added microtransactions when they said they wouldn't they'll probably break more promises) Horrible gameplay (clunkjy garbage loot system movement is driving is horrible)The only reason this game is popular is due to all the twitch.tv streamers playing it because 1) shills2) nothing else to playOnce the year finishes and games are released this game will be more dead than DayZ. Garbage game wish I could refund this. I honestly prefer H1Z1 because at least the gameplay is enjoyable and slightly competitive.really gamedont buy,Not Recommended

Pros Cool concept Fun with buddiesCons Terrible performance even on high end hardware Crashing Combat feels stiff and lacks polishHopefully all the cons will be worked out as the game progresses through early access. If you are desperate for a new game this will be fun but there is no rush in buying this title. It has a long way to go.,Not Recommended
This is a fun game as other have said which I would agree. The big problem is the game requires microtransactions. Let me explain. Did you just slog through 10 rounds so you can get the better one of the two possible reward boxes? Great! Now pay $2.50 to open it. Wow! I just paid $30 a few hours ago for the game. I see a pattern here. Not cool.,Not Recommended

Initially when I got this game I thought hey what a great idea for a Battle Royal. Later I realized the developers knew exactly what they were doing baiting the entire CS GO community as well as the Rocket League community into buying rare one time offered crates on the sole idea that they will be worth something one day. So now there is a dilemma most players spend time trying to harvest crates more than actually working on skills in this game. I've been watching the steam market and this game should be called Economics Simulator. The developers have gotten so caught up in the money they have been making from the market and crates that they completely forgot to update it. Now there are problems such as Play Doh building and so many bugs that players can literally run over squads of people with a car while they are inside of buildings. This game had a lot of promise but greedy developers always know how to ruin a good thing when their only goal is double decker blumpkins and powder filled nights at the club. Stop cashing out and work on your game please You made it but you haven't made it that far.,Not Recommended

They consistently add new weapons and update the game on a weekly basis. These updates usually break more things than fix. However atleast there are more guns and animations! Bugs that make the game unplayable have been around for months without alleviation. Buildings don't fully render early game (if at all) causing a huge disadvantage to players who get this issue like myself. LOD system is trash even though Simplygon is good. Networking is beyond buggy. There is no indication of what the player's ping is. 3 crashes and 2 deaths due to lack of buildings loading in properly today. The aiming is inconsistent upon armor not always damaging properly or hits being registered in general. Jump shots are super accurate however over the shoulder shooting is not accurate. When jumping out of the plane and pulling the parachute other players 'chutes do not always render leading to a supposed safe are to be unsafe. These are a few of the bugs afflicting the game. Its in rough shape and not worth getting in Early Access. I am definitely getting very tired of this game and playing it less every week.,Not Recommended

After putting in over 200 hours on this game I can say that I do not recommend it. The game for starters should not have been released in the state it is. Its creator Brendan Greene has worked on other battle royales such as H1Z1 and has worked on Day Z. He ultimately ending up selling PUBG to a chinese guy. And no I'm not making this up he got his money and ran. Also PUBG uses Fortnites battle UI obviously Fortnite uses it better and is overall a better free game that's not riddled with hackers.The game of the year nomination was ??? Questionable I mean the game wasnt even released yet there's rubberbanding bullet registering is a joke vehicles are a mess and not to mention the hackers. Their system is actually so bad that a buddy of mine downloaded a hack to use against the hackers. Basically you PUBG not worth 30 dollars its more fun watching the PUBG WTF clips and China is not number 1 you guys you have your own severs. (Note that the chinese have to pay for fast lanes and watch ads in China set up by PUBG and not the Chinese government I have a Chinese friend who plays),Not Recommended
Product received for free. After 170 hours of game and top 97 on rank my experience Major Technical Problems Runs bad on any rig Memory Leak make it impossible to play with less than 8 gb ( even with 8 gb you have to reset the game often or play until it crashes out of ram) Crashs loads of them. Devs won't set priority most of their team is worried with non core gameplay like mods and such. Stuttering and framedrop is a big portion of the match it really ruins the game experience Cheaters are not that rare Ban are inconsistent as fak because they aren't being reported via game but via players externaly. Major Core Gameplay Problems (IMO) Circle RNGRight now the area that limit the game borders (whitecircle) is totaly unfair and broken. The first 2 3 circles are totaly okay the problem is the small ones. They are the opposite of strategy and will make your game a gambling with frustrating outcomes.You have 3 outcome's scenarios from the rng 1 The circle closes at your position. You'll probably win cuz your positioning is better and people will have to move through hell and firefight to get at you. Thats pretty much it. People will die trying to get in the safezone and you just need to fight half squad or 3 man squad. Mind thats occurs 3 5% of the games. i have more than 160+ matchs at season 2 and happend like 5 times to me. I won every single one.2 Circle wont close at your position and you have to run for it. What should be okay if you can predict it but the RNG factor you up most of the times. It's basicly impossible to deal with open areas at the final circles without a car. At 15 20 people left it's basicly suicide to run over the open field you will probably die before find cover cuz other players get lucky at the circle and will shoot the hell out of you. If you're GOOD at trading you can still win... but your chances are crushed near 10%. This is 70% of the game. 3 End circles are at the center and you have enough cover to move on using strategy with terrain knowledge what makes a fair scenario. that's 10% of the game and very satisfying when possible... but the RNG will you on the next close up or just closes at you. At both situation it wont feel fair even with a win most of scenarios are &gt Circle rng &gt Team A are at Cover &gt Team B have to run for it &gt If team B moves early will die due to the lack of cover &gt If it is too late will be ed up by the blue zone unless have a car&gt if you have a car the noise will give your position and probably 1 2 members will die inside the car&gt Pray for the rng god for the next circle&gt Closes at unfair position again for team B&gt Team A is again inside&gt sad.jpgEither you are TEAM A or TEAM B it is unpleasant to see that outcome no strategy just mindless runing at open fields cuz you cant do about it while the other team are at cover w8 to you.Thats NOT strategy you can't predict the circle it's pure gamble.People argue that's lack of planing by players and it's not. You can try to predict the next circle but the one after that goodluck. You can try to predict the worst case scenario? Yes you can. But the outcome is the same. If you are really good at shooting you can outcome the situation with pure shooting skills like most streamears do. And well.. that's less than 1% of the playerbase. I'm okay at shooting at 97 general rank and 1k killing rank i can say people aren't that good. And if you're not well...We get back at the RNG gamble. Unfair and cold as . 3'rd person camera Well it can be used by both sides at trading but at some spots it's basic the most op thing in the game. At corners it's impossble to see players using the camera advantage and you have to get at that corner in some situations. It's unbalanced and can be use by both sides but at corner's is impossible to overcome unless you have a shotgun the enemy is really bad and you are really fast.At some 4x1 situation i won because of the corners... it's just not right. I did not overcome their skill i just have wall protection with vision of enemy aproach unless 4 guys come at once what i doubt in close areas they have to granade the out of me and hope i get kill'd. Community problems Support sucksDevs won't reply your bug related topic very often even if its about memoryleak.They will just erase your post and claim that they have enough for bug reports mine ins't necessary. Dont even bother to post on steam instadelete basicly.Bad support to people who plays with good hardware but poor performance horrible optimization at all. Toxic playerbaseUnless you really like to play solo duo and squad is no good if you aren't playing with friends. People are toxic like everyother gaming comunity. Dont even bother to comunicate. They'll TK sure you can report them and get their asses banned but it's not a solution IMO. What about the GOOD part?Well the game is fun to play at short time period but really frustrating at long term. Rng has this false sensation of victory that's rare to occur and will keep fresh at most times. Feels good but when you realize that's not smart and fair the fun goes away.Yes you can get better and better at shotting but in this game positioning is the most important thing in the game. And if lucky is at your side well... good! If it's not sad. Do not spect fair outcomes it's really rare.EDIT Macros are a problem right now people can do it with no problem whatsoever. Keep that in mind.,Not Recommended

"This game was great especially being in early access. I still recommend it but when I bring up PUBG I also bring up how the Devs are creating this beautiful game into a kindergarden. I understand rules help people get along but in a game thats TAGGED for being SURVIVAL...YOU SHOULD BE READY TO SURVIVE.Devs shouldn't have to hold your hand to keep players happy. When I found out that you could now be reported for team killing I was genuinely upset. I'm not one for team killing BUT to put up a protective barrier to players who cry because the ""partner"" they thought they had blew their head off is ridiculous. Like I said this is survival. That's the best part of the game. Your heart starts racing you talk to your squad make sure they're cool. THATS the rush of the game. I've been team killed but I've always expected it to happen sooner or later. Am I upset that those players killed me their own teammate. HELL NO. It's the game and when you take the game away from people you'll lose base players that thoroughly enjoyed the game before it was ponies and rainbows. And with this stream killing ITS CALLED SURVIVAL. If you're dumb enough to publically show your position YOU derserve to be shot by everyone on the map. ITS CALLED PLAYERUNKNOWN PLAYER U N K N O W N DON'T SHOW YOUR POSITION! Stop the bans stop the rules remember what this game really is and try your best to keep it that way.

"If this game didn't sell as well as it did it would be an embarrassment. At it's core PUBG is fine but it was executed so poorly that this game is garbage. Loot Spawns The complaint I hear the most about is the spawn rate of loot and until today I had no problem with the loot drops but after the three matches I played today my opinion has changed. First match loot and entire apartment building walk out with a shotgun and die instantly. Second match go to mansion and loot a whole building again walk out with a shotgun and die instantly to someone with an m4. Third and final match loot SIX count em SIX buildings in water town and only walk out with a 9mm the other person water was so bad that I managed to tag him 3 times in the head with my 9mm if I had ANY OTHER GUN I would have killed him. I can understand not having a rifle in every bulding BUT NONE IN SIX BUILDINGS?!?!!?? Honestly stupid.Glitches I don't even know where to begin with glitches in PUBG. There are too many to count and too many to remember. But one particular glitch I do remember was when I was in the top 5 I had a kar98 and was sniping people from a roof. All of a sudden I get stuck in the floor and can't get out die to the zone. This is commonplace in PUBG and I can't believe the devs have let this slide for so long. I understand with AAA companies patching out glitches isn't something that will make them money but with a dev team comprised of modders and people who have experianced what it is like to be a ""gamer"" ( that word but it's all i could think of) in the modern day you would expect them to show some decency and patch their glitches.Tick Rate I'm not quite sure as to what the tick rate in PUBG is but I know it's low as . Alot of the time you can spray a whole clip at someone for only 5 of your bullets to hit. hit reg is awful.Bullet Penetration oh my ing god. This is by far the worst thing about PUBG. Bullets don't penetrate through ANYTHING! You see that twig over there? Yeah it can probably block bullets. All the time I die because I can't hit someone through the ing wooden handrail on stairs for them to chuck a grenade up and for me to die. I'll address grandes in a second but for now let's talk more about bullet pen. The fact that a CHAIN LINK FENCE can BLOCK SNIPER BULLETS is actually . I don't know why I don't see more people complaining about this. The fact that a shoot doesn't have ANY bullet pen in 2018 is beyond stupid and again if the game didn't sell as well as it did I would call this embarassing.Grenades oh boy the frag grenade not much to say about it other than if you hear one land next to you as Kenshiro from fist of the North Star says ""omae wa mou shindeiru"" or for you non weebs ""You're already dead"". If a nade goes off anywhere within a 20 mile radius of you you're dead. Nades are basically a free kill and are the one piece of gear that is littered all over the map.And finally my last point of contention MIRAMAR Who the actual shipped this map? Miramar is by far the worse map in any game I have ever played. All the guns it introduced are All the vehicles in the map are And all the towns in the map are Just a map overall. And if you try to remove the map from your game files you can get vac banned oh boy my favorite.",Not Recommended

I don't hate this game and it doesn't suck but it has one of the worst groups of developers out there.

Great game great concept was insane fun for about 3 weeks. It's a shame the game has gotten buggier over time. They've made tens of millions of dollars you'd think the game would be at least 70% playable by now. But why fix this broken game when you can add purchasable keys to gamble more of your money away towards microtransactions. Instead of relying on your entertainment from the game they've now decided to cop out like the majority of triple A titles and use addiction to get your money. It's only a matter of time until they add some copy and paste rank+ladder system (bronze silver gold etc.) to get you hooked on a never ending cycle of rage and addiction. And take my word for it this game isn't leaving early access any time soon if at all.,Not Recommended

So after 26 hours I got my first chicken dinner which means I have nothing to prove myself in EA and I Can wait for full released game thus this review. ( I just hope I didn t kill any streamer )Game is a battle royal genre which means you get dropped on an island people killing each other and try to be the last one survivor as playable arena gets smaller by the time.This is not overall game review for everyone but players who love stealth silent predator playstyle. Game is most of the time the most played game on steam there are plenty of reviews you should have some rough info about this game already by this time.1. My biggest problem in this game render distance of grass is terrible. Every player who has at least 2x scope can see you across the map. If you want to go across field forget about crawling your best bet is to just run zig zagging if someone is shooting at you and ghillie suit will not help you either. If you want to cover yourself from unwanted attention of sniper your best bet is tree rock or a house not even bush will save you. Render distance of grass is set aprox. 100 m so you might be fine for closer distances but bevare of players using foliage setting on very low. It is still kinda dense but only when you are very close. Always keep your back against the solid object because no matter how hard you scout area in front of and behind you you are still very visible from distance. My advice is move through areas with trees where they cast shadows if you have not equipped bright colored clothes. 2.Clothes. There are microtransactions in this game and those are clothes. Some say it s cosmetics and it doesn t matter. But believe me it does. You start with shinny clothes and people who unlocked nice dark camouflaged clothes are in advantage right from the beginning. You land after parachuting from plane and right from the beginning you shine around like snowman in desert. It s good to go where no one does but loot might not be worthy and you never know who is around.3.Sound. Almost everything makes sound. You are not gonna tip top I tried that as I was hitting WASD gently but fast like woodpecker still making noise even turning around makes noise. You better camo your footsteps with plane passing by. It s different when it s rainy. You re not gonna hear anyone outside running. Silenced guns are good when shooting from large distances but loud close. When you hear someone coming best thing to do is just freeze and wait for him getting better position or cover is bad idea because you immediately give away your position when you move 1 meter and there is no problem shooting through walls like they are not even there.4. Framerates. When you suddenly encouter player close to you you might get huge lag spikes which might get you killed because those miliseconds of reaction time matter a lot and you are not able to do anything. Frame drops are really common in EA games but spikes like these cannot be acceptable. I do not recomend getting too close to the enemy player as you might experience tearing. gtx 1060 i7 700hq 16gb ram playing on medium setting and framerates jump from 80 fps to 25 in split of a second.4.I m solo player and luckily for me there is a first person mode for solo players as well. In my opinion third person view in games like this has no place as it breaks the immersion giving huge advantage when peaking around corners or checking area around you.Engaging head to head in stealthy playstyle isn t the best option. I was able to win by stalking players circling and killing them from behind.This is the game when you don t know if you want to recommend it or not.If you add other problems like banning stream killers bugs and glitcher texture loading problems and poor performance it s easy to not recommend this game. But that s fine it s early access for now. But how can game developer make micro transactions and make esports tournaments when game is not even finnished that s beyond me ridiculous some would say.If you like gun blazing hunting players engagin in combat head on and enjoying game as it is I recommend it for you. If you are sneaky like me enjoying stealthy playstyle It s hard to recommend this game.,Not Recommended

Even tho i like this game its becoming worse and worse with the idiotic health buff that players were crying for.So in the beta armor didnt count and players were whining about it. Now shooting anywhere else the head is just pointless. You hit your target 6 times doesnt matter players dont die from 6 hits in this game hitting him 1 time in the head instant death makes no sense.Tried to talk about it on the forums i wrote 1 swearing world got 100 warn points and got banned forever from forums.ggServers lagg like so even if you aim correctly your hits wont get registered 50% of the time.Now that FPS View arrived this lagg does even more damage it literally makes my head hurt after 1 round of playing.Since this is the only somewhat okay game of this type you cant choose anything else but i wouldnt recommend this.,Not Recommended
This game brings sorrow to my soul.The fact that it has been 2 years since the release and there has been over 500m $ in revenue just shows that straight up incompetent idiots own this product.It goes without saying that the biggest regret of my life is that any of money let alone mine went to these bean brained pieces of who give zero s about making anything decent for anyone.I hope that they treat their families and that someone treats them as they treated us when developing this disgrace they even dared to put a price on.I also hope they never touch a keyboard exept if someone bashes one into the feces they have inside their heads.I am deeply ashamed for buying this and will have to reconsider the choices I have made in life.Expcept for writing this review I hope it prevents you from buying it thus saving you all the pain I have experienced while trying to play it.,Not Recommended

"I have put almost 300 hours into this game and I absolutely can not recommend it for a variety of reasons 1. Absolute early access hell. I bought this game right when it came out and the devs constantly showed their lack of interest in the playerbase after they got their money. Horrible server desync horrible policies abandoning update schedules and most of all developing consoles versions of a game that is is EARLY ACCESS for PC players.2. Garbage policies. I have won MANY games the majority are screenshotted on my profile) but I am by no means a good player. I play with the same group of 3 other people EVERY night and I am far from the best but I was greeted on the 9th of September with a YOU ARE BANNED message. Other than being not good at the game I play with &gt 5 Mb/s down which is purely a detriment to me as I often lag beyond the point of playing(not the game's fault). It is almost like they just ban everyone that has been reported which leads me to my next point.3. The community is garbage. The streamers (Stonemountain etc) are whiny unfunny losers who whine and complain when things don't go their way. It got to the point where players would honk the horns of their vehicles around streamers and the would get banned for ""Stream sniping"" even though there is no way to tell a non teammate's identity without killing them. This is an absolutely ridiculous policy. If you don't want people coming and trying to bring some comedy to your unfunny stream with a disproportionate amount of players viewing don't stream. And if that means you stop collecting your NEETbucks and go get a job that is just how it is. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of talented and funny streamers but the fact that their complaining can ruin the experience(IE ban) other players that have no idea what is going on is ludicris.4. Balance is an issue. The loot spawns are incredibly disproportionate and there becomes a point like in several Battle Royale games where the RNG completely takes away skill or lack thereof. I have landed in places like Tunnels(shelter) Crater(prison) and gotten 0 weapons or armor but one person that enters a small shack gets a Kar98k and headshots both me and my partner. No developers actually seem to be interacting with the loot balance in a positive way instead choosing to add weapons to airdrops like the Groza which differ very mildy from other more common weapons.5. Vehicle movement is glitchy and annoying. I can't stress how many times that my team and I have been driving through the ""hand modelled"" fields outside of po i and had our UAZ(jeep like vehicle) completely tip over and injure all of us. This sometimes even costed us a match we had a likelyhood to win. The best solution to make a only the most logical response to tipping a military vehicle throw a frag grenade at it and get in AFTER the esplosion so that the car can magically tip itself over again damaged but driveable.These issues are only scraping the top of the barrel with the issues with this game. I imagine I will get several responses stating to ""leave the game alone it is in early access"" but to that I say this Early access is a scam. With the exeption of a few absolute gems it has been nothing other then a cheap scheme where ""optimistic"" developers cash on on the hype for the game and then slowely fade away into obscurity leaving the game to die. Despite what PLAYERUNKNOWN says the have already abandoned some of their schedules for much needed updates and fixes that would make the game playable. but instead they choose to develope console versions ban innocent players and act like they anything other than stealing the money for a project that will likely never come to a finish as the playerbase reaches 1 million people that jumped on a hype train. It was fun at times but this ban and all of the garbage the push on the playerbase is completely unacceptable and if I could get a refund I would in a heartbeat.edit I am currently unbanned. My review will still remain negative. The fun I had and the hours I put into thius game outside of the first month or so were with friends. The enjoyment I had was not really because of the game but the people i was with. This game CAN be fun I never said it couldn't I simply stated the way things are from the point of view of someone who has actually put enough time into the game to have well rounded opinion. If you are with friends and want to kill people go for it this might be a decent game for you.",Not Recommended

"This game is decent but it's not worth the pricetag. I've played almost 21 hours and i'm already sick of the game not because I don't like battle royales but because the game idea is horribly executed. There are only two maps in the game which get boring very quick when you keep playing them over and over again. Most of the game you are just running searching for supplies instead of ""battling"" other players which is why this game should be called running simulator 2017. There is frequent hiccups and stutters while playing the game even if you have a good computer and also it's been reported that there are countless hackers in the game still. Playing with friends is a little better but not by much. Overall 5/10. It's just simply not worth the pricetag.

"The game at least the core idea of it is great. It's lacking in polish performs fairly bad doesn't look all that great and the netcode is horrible but its early access.

""There will be no microtransactions in early access""...from their own FAQ and a few interviews iirc...but here we are just days away from the first microtransaction crate to be introduced to the game under the guise of 'charity' and 'funding a tournament'...please this is a test for how much money they can milk out of their playerbase. They are using us to fund the tournament passively so they don't have to cut into the hundreds of millions of dollars they've already made off us buying their game. It's a sad joke. P.U. himself has been handling this situation very badly as well saying things like ""I don't see the problem here"" and ""So we can forget about the crate drama now you know car horns are coming right? kappa""...it's ing disgracful. He has also stated that the final game will have no free crates...so you will have to pay $2.50 to open a crate which will contain A SINGLE cosmetic item at random with the possibilty of duplicates. A whole outfit could cost you upwards for $25...as much or more than the game itself. The money has went to his head.

This may be the best example of a game with such a great concept it just executes is poorly. Damage is inconsistent across the board for all weapons. The out of play zone doesn't punish players nearly enough. Lag and client side hit detection cause massive disadvantages in fights. The Dev team is witch hunt banning players. Before they fixed the bug where players could see and shoot through buildings they added crates and keys. The game is addicting. It's fun. It's entertaining. Play it with friends. You'll have a great time. Play solo? You're going to see and feel all of the games issues. You'll end up just waiting for your buddies to get online.UPDATE Netcode seems to be worse. No idea why.UPDATE 10/09/17 Building not loading for people with game on a HDD is still a thing. Can still be exploited. Both using call outs and just plain shooting. Speed hackers aren't being banned but people using the horn are. Client side hit detection is a massive issue still as well.

This game may be the king of its genre but it's not a good game and I don't understand the level of hype it's gotten. For whatever reason there is a fanaticism around this game that ignores glaring flaws. This game is saddled with insanely inconsistent hit detection lag compensation issues a really poor tick rate and some of the worst RNG I've ever seen. 90% of the time the game would be more aptly described as Running Simulator. You're often punished for having to fight other players based on timing of the play zone. On top of that this game has some really poor moderation policies where basically they suck up to streamers at the expense of the rest of the playing world. The game is a mess. The developer is a mess. The community is a mess. Again why this game is so popular is beyond me. It's simply not good.,Not Recommended

"This game wants you to buy features with microtransaction. Bought the game as it was released at steam. You could buy lootboxes with cosmetics with ingame currence and open it.But what is now? Your lootbox is locked with a key. Give them real money and you will get a key to open your hard earned lootbox (which you can buy with ingame currence or real money). Why? Not earned enough money through selling the game?Furthermore now you can buy a dlc which give you features like a ""progression system"" for your account daily missions etc. but only 22 July 2018.

Maybe they are kind enough and tell you some secretsTo sum up After the first 5 minutes of a match the game slows down and gets boring.

This game used to have a pretty good start. It had some funny glitches but only a few deadly ones not like dayz sa did. Gameplay is pretty good and makes fun. But here comes the Point where i'am disapointed. From the start on they made much money with the steammarket place(steam isn't the only one getting part of the commision). Some clothes were/are selled for around 200 700Dollar from users. And many more in the lower segment. So they earned pretty much. I could accept that because everyone had the chance to get those because you earned those boxes by playing. But now the most expensive clothes are in boxes for which you need a key to open like CS GO. Better remove them or this game will lose it's support from the comunityEDIT ATM there are no boxes anymore with keys needed but lets wait for 1.0,Not Recommended

Okay so 1.0 came out promising many things. It delievered on some and others less. 1) This game still runs on low end PCs. When your game has 2+ ing million players every day you'd think that they'd be considerate of the hundreds of thousands who don't have great rigs but no it still runs like crap. 2) There are still bugs that have existed from day 1 3) There's a conspious lack of features promised several months ago. You're telling me they created a huge desert map that's bigger than the original one but still can't make a shooting range? 4) Still many many hackersSo yeah.

"Wouldn't recommend this game at all unless you want to invest in an addition to upgrading your computer to just even be satisfied with performance with this game. My first 300 hours of the game were in the first enjoyable months of the game early access release.I have the standard computer specs to run games like GTA 5 Call of Duty and all sorts of Tom Clancy Games with satisfactory performance. I've also purchased a software called CPUCORES thinking that it would improve performance for the PUBG game I've found out that it has improved FPS but hasn't fixed my problem for buildings rendering in.The graphics in this game are terrible unless you're looking at the textures and details of the interior and weapons. Other than that everything in this game has terrible graphics which I don't seem to have a problem with. The problem I have is regarding to why it is so demanding to render all these terrible graphics with ""VERY LOW"" rendering distance. When I am parachuting down to the play area I always experience all these unrendered and mesh looking structures with nothing inside of them and after a minute of pure lag and destruction to my performance all of the mentioned structures finally render and I can go on about my game.Everytime I encounter an enemy I for some reason receive lag spikes when I aim down sights towards them. I see someone and as soon as I aim down my sight whether it'd be a red dot sight or an 8x scope and my game justs detect this large impact to the client side.During a match upon exiting there is such a high rate for me to crash where the game is unresponsive and stuck on the loading screen. (like how hard is it to just execute a function telling my client to send me back to the main menu screen.)For the community it is really mixed between middle aged people in there 20s or 30s and somewhat uncommonly some teenagers and younger. The community is most of the time great and sometimes anger fills them and they start to fire at you back verbally or even physically (in game) if taken to that level. If you decide to let auto matchmaking kick in for a match of Duo or Squads you are likely to get someone who are cooperative. Very rarely you will get matched with someone who will be uncooperative based from my experience.When you're on the PUBG discussions specifically the ""Looking for Players"" thread you won't have any troubles finding a player more than likely but if you're the one looking to be paired up with someone. Keep in note that there are a lot of discriminant people (based from my experiences). When I say ""discriminant "" I'd like to mention that others are always looking for someone for a specific age your leaderboard positions the amount of hours you've accumulated in the game or even your gender. There are also a countless amounts of communities trying to recruit you to join their open and public Discord server. Also the people you meet are most likely going to abandon you (meaning that they will never speak to you) unless you really stand out to them in a good way. (like why can't we just all be open about who we want to play with). For me I'm just a typical person I only talk when it's necessary and so far pretty much all the people I met from the discussions has never bothered to talk to me again. So think of the discussion as a way to find a temporary partner.From the first months of release for PUBG it hasn't been such a pain to run. It was manageable and really fun to play at the time. PUBG was very responsive and they announced future updates before they were released. Many of which teased the community.PlayerUnknown was releasing monthly updates which was great! It was not until a couple months later that they stopped implementing updates that the majority of the community enjoyed. The updates which were just a couple or patches and bug fixes were unbelievably storage consuming. I'm saying that updates range from 5 to 10 GB.All in all I enjoy this game. If it wasn't for the insane amounts of performance required that it took just to run this game. Along with the lack of support to address better updates that improved performance upon this game. To sum this game up if you're planning on buying the game at full price it's essentially investing $30 on a poorly controllable and widely customizable character struggling to run around a huge island filled with 100 people with a progressively and painful closing blue circle that closes in a randomly generated area where remaining players are looking for a ""Chicken Dinner"" which is a phrase to commonly emphasize the winner of the match. The farther you get into the game without dying the higher reward you will receive as an in game currency known has ""Battle Points.""update u can check my pc specs on my steam profile and you will see that the game is honestly trying to kill my computer purposefully lolanother update so there's this new update adding emotes and ever since... i have not once got my pubg to start working without crashing on the pre match loading screen. i've been consistently looking at numerous forum posts for 6 hours trying to find the fix. anyways quality game",Not Recommended

I HAVE OVER 500 HOURS IN THIS TRAINWRECK. I know what I'm talking about. I've played copious amounts of solo duos squads solo duos and solo squads I know exactly what this game has to offer.PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was released in early 2017 and provided players with a game concept that most hadn't seen before it was truly fresh and saw its massive success from not being as buggy(?) and cheap looking as H1Z1. But now the honeymoon period is over the premise has worn thin and the gameplay is stale. More and more people are uninstalling complaining and leaving negative reviews a once overwhelmingly positive game is now at mixed. But wait this is one of the most successful games ever how is the gameplay getting stale when there are monthly updates and patches? The answer is the root cause of every issue in the game and will be the reason the game eventually loses its playerbase the answer is its developers of course. The curtain has been lifted and we are seeing who the Wizard of Oz really is an incompetent South Korean development team called Bluehole that made a few mediocre MMOs and mobile games spearheaded by an egotistical lead dev known as PlayerUnknown who is more concerned with spouting off his game's playercount (who are mostly internet cafe uses from China) and getting into twitter fights instead of fixing his deeply flawed game.Deeply flawed you ask? Yes. Every facet of this game is flawed. Every. Single. One. Let's go through them. First you boot up the game you will immediately see an ugly main menu that's fine though ugly main menus don't make a game bad though they are common with early access games. But you'll notice has a refresh button the reason being is that the menu constantly crashes and glitches such as not being able to join friends games when you click ready it cancels your teammates ready up status to the play button not being there (which just happened to me 20 minutes ago) or your goddamn character being naked for no reason. THIS IS JUST IN THE MAIN MENU. Next you get into a game you're faced with quite possible the most annoying lobby area ever conceived of in a game. Muting all players is essential in this part if you don't want to hear terrible 'China number one' jokes. But then you still have the noise of 30 guns being shot at once (in a game where gunshots are deliberately louder to help with finding action around the map). PlayerUnknown is at fault here for not putting more than 10 seconds of thought into what a player has to experience before every single match. It is truly annoying and sets the tone for the rest of the match you re about to play. Now you parachute a common occurrence is to glitch into any and every piece of environment sticking out leading you to cutting away the parachute and losing a chunk of your health in fall damage. This is no exaggeration this glitch happens constantly and has no foreseeable future to stop. We are only getting startd with the show that is this game. Next you run into the two main mechanics of the game after landing looting and shooting. Looting during the first minutes of the game is hilariously bad unless you use tab to drag items into your inventory you are guaranteed to pick up clothing pointless weapon attachments or stun grenades before the precious assault rifle on the ground. This strange loot prioritisation coupled with lag crippling lag during the opening moments of a match take away precious seconds during an already frantic rush for weapons and can often lead to you dying before even reloading your weapon. Then there s shooting and just like ARMA shooting feels like an afterthought like they ve added a floating weapon to a player model. This is in stark contrast to any AAA shooter where the shooting is a core mechanic and feels fluid. For months after release a problem persisted where after the bullets leaving a gun when being shot would not even go where the reticle indicated they would go after the second shot. Months. Wasn t this game trying to be a mil sim in the vein of ARMA? Then you have the gun constantly failing to aim past railings and windows an obvious result of almost every asset in the game being bought off the Unreal store and not actually built around the player models. The damage from the weapons is also inconsistent where you can shoot someone in excess of 8 times while missing their armour and they will live while other times you can kill someone in 3 shots. Every fight is unpredictable and frankly it feels disgusting how much fights rely on randomness. PUBG s most core mechanic feels clunky forced and unpredictable. Then you have driving the fact that the majority of PUBG highlights and fails videos consist of cars exploding and flying into the sky demonstrate that the driving in this game is just barely functional but due to the size of the map you ll be driving for a large portion of the game. Lastly you have the graphics and performance. You HAVE to play on the lowest settings if you don t have a fantastic gaming rig. You re going to be playing under 30fps if you try to make your game look anyway decent on regular specs not to mention you WILL crash. Now that the game s on the lowest settings the once beautiful Unreal engine now looks like a Vaseline soaked mess. Textures look muddy and the lighting is at the bare minimum. Being forced to make it look like this leads to a very bland looking gaming experience the game world never once wows you or surpasses mediocrity. But even with terrible graphics on low settings Blue Hole s spaghetti code and nonexistent optimisation still causes the game to still run like straight fluctuating between 30 50fps depending on where on the map you are. Does this sound like a fun gaming experience? Well it actually can be when these problems SOMEHOW don t come together to ruin your game and the reason it can be so much fun is because the Battle Royale concept is so fresh and addictive. But instead of us consumers getting a polished game which is consistently fun PlayerUnknown has chosen to milk the cash cow while putting very little effort into the definitive game of this genre. Blue hole (now more accurately referred to as Blue Balls) and PlayerUnknown made huge strides at the start they frequently listened to players and made changes based on their complaints and added fun and relevant content where it made sense (new guns first person on each server). Now we are 7 months on from release the game is still a buggy mess it is still one of the worst performing games I have ever played there are no new gamemodes and no new maps the game is as content bare and unpolished as it was 7 months ago. It s so disappointing as the game is GENUINELY FUN. I got my 30 dollars worth but you will get bored of it within days just as I did. The concept is great but a great concept can only carry a game with terrible gameplay so far. It s sad to finally loathe a game you once loved but after this disaster AAA developers will know what mistakes not to make and release a truly quality Battle Royale game that will bury this turd. I just ask. Why oh why couldn t these changes be made with the amount of success PUBG has got? WHERE DID YOUR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS GO BLUEBALLS? It s truly interesting how little the game's success has actually influenced the game itself. So I guess the moral of the story is DO NOT TRUST A MONEY HUNGRY MODDER AND INEXPERIENCED DEV TEAM TO MAKE A GOOD BATTLE ROYALE GAME.,Not Recommended

Since playing this game since its release pubg has come a long way from optimization to bug fixes and introducing new content and providing a unique battle royale experience. However in these recent months ive noticed a HUGE explosion in the amount of hackers we are seeing I would rarely run into a hacker on NA or AS servers maybe ONE hacker every week or two now you get a hacker EVERY GAME. Its ridiculous and totally takes the fun out of the game for all the players who are being fair. When you get killed through walls or your whole squad is knocked in seconds by one guy who would want to continue playing? Even after announcing they're banning 6k players a day the hackers are an endless wave and unless bluehole takes serious action I unfortunately cant see this game getting any better.,Not Recommended
The game itself is fun (when I get to play) most of the time the game causes my PC to black screen so I have to force restart it... Does the company behind PUBG plan to replace parts of my PC because their game destroyed them?? Doubtful they only care about getting their money from micro transactions (like they said they wouldn't do!)I would reccomend the game if it was working properly and if the creators didn't bold faced lie to the players.,Not Recommended
I used to recommend this game. I don't anymore and that's not only because of the microtransactions.PerformanceI am aware this is in early access but there have been ongoing performance problems that haven't been fixed for months. They've actually gotten worse. I have an NVidia GTX 970 and I cannot run this game at medium graphics at more than 80fps. At the lowest settings which are significantly lower I get 100fps at most. Maximum settings give me 20fps if I'm lucky.I choose to play with medium graphics with high render distance and low lighting. I get about 80fps at most which commonly drops to 50fps. In cities or with other players around me I sit reliably in between 30 and 40 frames per second.The concept and longevityThe concept for PUBG is very interesting. A harsh and realistic kill to survive kinda thing. I have no objections to the concept. The only bad thing I would really say about the gameplay and execution of this concept is that it does get dull fast. Every match has the same routine. The process doesn't feel repetitive it just feels to me like I'm waiting for something interesting to happen and I could just play another game and not waste my time.Maybe if the game had a real progression system I'd be more willing to play it (see the last section of this review). When I stop playing PUBG and start playing something else I feel genuinely impressed by how much better it feels than this game which brings me to my next section The feel of playing the gameSomething I value a lot in the games I play is responsiveness not just in UI but also in everything I do in game. My three most played games in my life are Overwatch LEGO Universe and Hot Wheels Velocity X. Overwatch has extremely polished character movement and lots of attention to the little things that make the experience enjoyable. LEGO Universe is the only MMO I've seen that paid any attention to this stuff and it felt great to play. Even Hot Wheels Velocity X a budget starved game from 2002 intended to be shovelware has very responsive controls and animations that make it enjoyable to play even now.PUBG's feel is different it's stupposed to be realistic and harsh. But they should also feel good to use. They don't. The game is not responsive. When I use the user interface it feels like something I would have found a few years ago on ROBLOX sometimes even worse.I was looking forward to first person servers because I thought the game felt bad partially because of me not being used to its third person. Turns out first person was just slapped onto the surface of the game and it feels horrible delayed inconsisent. Bad coding which I will touch on later.Car handling is cool though. I like it a lot. Reminds me a little of APB Reloaded which is surpisingly a good thing. Still sometimes it breaks and you go flying go tumbling run into an invisible block randomly explode flip over spin out rubber band teleport...BugsYes it's listed as early access. Should it be? No. With how much the developer caters to streamers don't be fooled by the early access tag. The developer is updating and maintaining this game as if it is a released product like Overwatch (except with much less support or community involvement). Most of the changes to the game that are made are almost meant to make this game worse to play. The developer doesn't care about how good it feels to play.The servers that host regular users are slow and buggy. They cut out crash and cause client glitches commonly. There's a whole list of bugs I could include in this review but when writing it I discovered Steam's character limit. But trust me when I say the developer does not care about fixing bugs unless he absolutely needs to. And he doesn't need to if the game's listed as early access. Then it's fine for the bugs to keep piling up especially because the streamers' servers aren't ruined by them.I've seen disorganization like this before in my adventures in technology where the developers struggle to keep everything working. It's a sign of disorganization lack of optimization and overall bad code. I would be surprised if you opened this game up and found organized code that ran well. What you'd really find is a jumbled mess of things slapped together without much effort or planning.The developer of the game said publically that he doesn't usually play the game or even really games in general. Consider that.The developerHere's a little more elaboration on the developer's interests. There is graffiti all over all the houses in game and it all depicts different streamer logos and advertisements for pro teams and popular players. It makes me wince at how much the developer panders to streamers. He doesn't pay any attention whatsoever at the bulk of his playerbase.In interviews he always talks about the skilled streamers as if it's his game's entire audience and purpose. Streamers also get priority servers over regular people. Where a good streamer can reliably place headshots and whatnot it's a commonplace thing in average servers for you to aim directly at someone even if they're running in a straight line for you unload your mag and not hit a single shot for no discernable reason.Then there's the worry about paid content. Specifically in rare non streamer community contact PlayerUnknown said in his Discord server that he intends to eventually make all cosmetic items paid because he doesn't think of cosmetics to be a feature of the game so it should be separate.This brings me to the butchering of the game's progression system...Progression systemThis game has little to no progression system. What do I mean by this? Well Overwatch has lootboxes you get all the time from just leveling up in addition to competitive rank level and more. PAYDAY 2 has different skill builds to try out money to make heists to try achievements to get. These things tie these games together giving you something back for playing the game adding more depth and variation to the experience.Now let's look at PUBG In early August you could get a tiny amount of coins from every game. Sometimes you could open a few boxes a week after hours of playing and you'd be lucky if you got anything at all.Then in mid September you could find about 50 people AFK in every match farming currency for Steam market exploitation. That ruined the game. The developers fixed it however by butchering the amount of coins you get from every game so you couldn't farm as efficiently.The result? Well the amount you gain from each match was cut to the ground and the prices for boxes hasn't changed at all. So good luck getting anything. There is now no progression system through this game nothing to keep you playing nothing to tie each match together. Every match becomes even more of a pointless waste of time waiting for something to happen that somehow is supposed to make the past four hours worth it.But it's not worth $30 and it's definitely not worth your time.,Not Recommended

First impression crude but amazingly fun game format great playing with friends the first month. Second impression Full of bugs they say will be worked out clunky lobby and team matching system (has a refresh button because it often doesn't work) laggy/glitching in the start of rounds and at various times weird physics (recent signs of improving)Most recent impression and why I've rated this thumbs down TOO MANY HACKERS I played 10 rounds and 5 were ended by speed and headshot hackers. Literally the same person ran around the map killing over 40% of the players with a headshot. Approx 5 10 players killed by one player every few seconds matches that used to be 20 30mins to have 10 remaining players are now down to 8 players in 5 10minutes. This has singlehandedly ruined the came. The bugs I was patient for since it's early access and because of the sheer amount of fun the game was. Now however you can't play a fair game long enough to really make the time invested to learn it worth it. My recommendation wait to purchase and see if they come up with remedies for the hacking.,Not Recommended

This game is the most overrated game ive ever played. IMO its the battlefield of Battleroyale (The COD being H1Z1). This game is more based of getting your loot first whereas H1Z1 will see you with a gun almost instantly. Also gunfights in this are much more slower just like Battlefield. Alot of time i have played this has been spent running to the zone. The few gunfights i have encountered 90% of them have been a simple shot or so when they arnt looking. I the others have actually been a full on gun fight which was still pretty boring.If you can get this game for less then 15 do it otherwise stay away.,Not Recommended

Maybe it's a sell if it ever comes out of Early Access but right now there are too many issues woes and network inconsistencies going on. Not much unlike all other games in the genre. That said I like that this game in particular is trying to at least go its own way and trim all the fat and I want to like its concept. But there's no ooomph to the gunplay no good feedback and I'm often too busy fighting network and startup issues to really have a good time. Not to mention the sound is really out of whack positional audio simply does not work and you get little to no feedback from where you're being shot. All issues that exist may very well be addressed before proper release. I'm well aware this is an unfinished game and right now it's not for me. I could not possibly recommend this game to anyone in its current state. But worth keeping an eye on nontheless.,Not Recommended

I'll start off by saying i've played FPS games like CSGO battlefield Rust COD and Arma 2/3 for countless hours and i consider myself a decent player in these style of games. My pc is better than the recommended system specs and i have no technical troubles with the game. I enjoy the game concept and many aspects are up to the standard of what you'd expect from a game that made probably over a billion USD. I generally kill 5 15 players after a good start but die for reasons that shouldnt be a problem. I would definiatly play more if they could fix the current problems. But here's a bunch of real reasons why you should not play this game Input is extremely laggy / unresponsive (aiming using ads) Camera is glitchy (passenger camera is unbearable and flickers) You need a $1000+ graphics card to get consistent fps above 100 on medium settings Movement is unresponsive and annoying in general. Hackers are still a problem. The anticheat isn't even stopping game modifying cheats (movment speed and spread accuracy cheats) like every other game would. Looting is also still terribly unresponsive and basically requires you to open the UI and drag everything instead of just using the keybind. 90% of players will irrationally finish you instantly for no reason instead of trying to kill other immediate threats making your proably 20 minutes of looting a waste. (why not have invinsibility for 2 seconds? this would make so much difference) The control settings are WAY to over complicated and dumb literally 30 different sensitivity options for different sights vehicles ect. Not to mention the UI for customizing the controls and settings is annoyingly small so finding anything quickly is a giant hassel. Parachuting is still so unrealistic and glitchy. Why when you get near the ground you magically slow down? also when you are 100% going to land on top of a building you will often just teleport to the ground or worse just fall and lose half your hp. First person mode camera is even more unrefined. The new map espesially is way too big. Player's who try to play passivly will spend 30 minutes looting probably just to die before even seeing someone. The zone mostly gives the players on foot no chance. there are way too many open areas which are basically a garanteed death espesially on the new map. A less random more balanced zone would make sense. Or maybe bring back weather? those games were always interesting and different where stealth was fun and nessesary. Stun grenades suck and grenades in general are extremly time consuming and often risky to throw. The trajectory lines are inaccurate sometimes and also regular frag grenades are Over powered in general. Im fairly certain armour and helmets have no effect on frag grenade's damage. Random clothing spawns everywhere with no actual benefit in picking it up at all. This game is way too random unresponsive campy unbalanced and unfair (especially thanks to cheaters) I can't reccomend this to anyone with an average level of patience and expectation until loot+vehicle spawning is more consistent looting itself is intuitive and balanced hackers are not a constant problem and they make the overall feel of the game more responsive.It feels like they have given up on the game they made their crazy profits and now they barly update the game. They could easily resolve various problems or actually improve the game itself but they simply just dont care. Sh*t game fortnight is better any day. I literally play this just to have a laugh at all the bullsh*t. 4/10 would not recommend.,Not Recommended

+ The only good game in the battle royale genre+ Realistic gunplay Loot 30 minutes play 5 minutes (Gameplay too random sometimes you have to run several km to find a car only to die just before you reach it! The two times I reached top 2 the game decided to **** me instead of the other guy and placed the circle right around him while pros might think that it's ok to a player who plays the game for fun only that is really an unfair advantage!) Performance issues (Slow texture loading &amp random game freezes) Skin microtransactions (seriously? why does a game currently topping out on steam charts and costs $29.99 need money to pay for an esport tournament??) Bugs (vehicles physics jumping mechanic) Out of Early Access and still no menu to select map to play? Instead of speding time on that feature they decided to release new crates Although the concept of the game is pretty good imo I can't recommend the game at this state,Not Recommended
"After reading other reviews about the developer's intentions I decided to delve a little further into the claims about the introduction of microtransactions. To my shock horror what I read turned out to be true and I'm devastated that this game is eventually going to turn into another ""one of those"" games that solely rely on players with a huge wallet purely looking to pay to win as opposed to playing to win.In terms of performance nothing great is expected for an early access game. Yes there is going to be minor and sometimes major flaws that will be worked on alongside performance issues. That was expected and I fully accepted that when purchasing the game so I have no quarrels when it comes to performance being a tad bit behind schedule.Another thing I've come across is players being banned for disturbing a streamer during their money grabbing streams. That's the whole point of gaming is it not? Just because you're willing to put your commercially bought face on the internet whilst talking absolute garbage and in some cases blurting out racist terms when the chips are down in a game (wew PewDiePie!) does not mean you should be banned and ultimately removed from the playing experience. I am once again finding myself disappointed and distrusting of the game developers because of this and hope this was just a minor mistake and should not be repeated. If however it is repeated and players are banned for ""ruining"" some idiot's stream in other words beat said streamer in a gunfight then I highly doubt I'll be playing this game any longer.I had high hopes for this game but if microtransactions are going to be implemented as planned and players are banned for ""stream sniping"" aka playing the damn game as intended I don't think I'll be trusting this developer with any future updates or projects he and his team behind the implementation work on.",Not Recommended
Had high hopes for this one but I suppose the hype plays its part. As it stands right now I cannot recommend this game for the simple fact that it's rather disappointing when it comes to core concept pull off methods and optimisation/resource allocation priority even though my rig can handle it with ease. Unnecessarily high requirements for such a widely praised high audience game.You spend 85% of your game time looting/foraging for gear that you may or may not even be fortunate enough to need. Provided you pass this boring early to mid phase at all you'll spend the other 10% dropping items to free up inventory space and/or seek shelter from the circle. The 5% that remains at hand is you actually playing the game gun in hand and hoping you make it to the end a joke of a concept at this stage of early access. Same old rotations over and over again same base principles of loot and hide. The input/controls feel lanky and delayed nowhere near the responsiveness of similar shooters that do it far better. The atmosphere is decent for starters but there's room for improvement. It feels shallow and superficial it doesn't get me into that gunslinging mood that Dirty Bomb or CS GO boast.Now as a company Bluehole is practically non existent among sacred names so all is taken into account. They have a lot to improve on with Unreal Engine. Yet they did seem to get their marketing right as it turns out streamers manage to do most of the heavy lifting since they always cater to a wider audience far better than any gameplay demo coming from the devs. In that regard no bashing is intended simply observing the trends that prevail nowadays. It matters not how good or bad a game is as long as streamers play it. No sugar coating needed either.Wrap up Plenty of potential on paper poorly executed. 30 well spent.Exactly how PUBG came to be the most played game on Steam still eludes me but certainly the playerbase knows best. After all 1.6 million people surely cannot be wrong. Masses are always right right?If the devs do manage to prove me wrong in a year's time then I will update my review. Otherwise save your money.*Update 13 Jan 2018Decent optimization added vaulting new map tweaked recoils. A step in the right direction but movement still feels clunky.,Not Recommended

While I would LOVE to give this a postive review I can't. The truth is you can't win anymore. Between teleporting players and being shot through walls I can't recommend this game. Like a lot of games that came before it with no punishment to hackers/cheaters its full of them. Intill this game gets an anti cheat or a way to report suspcious behaviour and have it looked into this game will slowly have its player base eroded. Other games have died off because of these type of short comings and if PUBG doesn't step up with an answer it will to. While I will be willing to change my review if this changes intill then I say do not purchase.,Not Recommended

PUBG is a really fun game definitely worth the purchase. However in the last couple of days PLAYERUNKNOWN himself has said that they will be adding a CS GO crate and key system to the game for cosmetic items. The profits of this will go towards the prize pool of a gamescom tournament for PUBG. This game is one of the best selling games on Steam do you not think that the developers would have enough money already for the tournament? Apparently not. Worst of all PLAYERUNKNOWN said in the past that this game won't feature microtransations until after it has been officially released. Meaning he has lied to the community. This game is still in early access and they are adding microtransations aboslutely disgusting. Although I enjoy the game and will probably continue to play it I cannot recommend it to anyone else as the game hasn't even been finished yet and the devopers are already trying to take as much money out the wallets of players who have already payed 27 for an unfinished game.TL DR The developers are adding microtransations into the game.

"This game has issues It's biggest one being the actual devs themselves.

Sure whatever you say BlueHole. Also with this current controversy involving Fortnite's battle royale mode BlueHole has demonstrated a lack for professionalism that should not be accepted in this industry whether it is from an indie developer or a triple A one and let's not forget the whole ""stream sniping"" thing that any negative review will mention. All that said the game plays decently but is a technical mess with a serious lack of optimization. I doubt BlueHole intends to ever polish their game because they are making money hand over foot without needing to. I suggest staying away from this game for the time being I certainly wish I had.edit So Pubg came out of early access and as of the time of writing this edit they have fixed almost none of the issues that were present in the game when it was in early access.",Not Recommended

Bluehole has chosen to follow a very unconsumer friendly business practice of selling mystery chests for $2.50 inside the chest is a single item out of a set of items that contains 3 or 4 items so the minimum you would need to spend for a complete skin would be 7.50 However its random and you can get duplicates furthermore the crates contain 5 sets. If you want to complete a skin expect to gamble at least $50 and then still end up missing some items. I would not recommend anyone buy this game at this time as this practice is increadibly unconsumber friendly as its basically just gambling.,Not Recommended
PUBG is an excellent battle royale but with its poor optimization it is impossible to play. The devs promise better optimization but the game continues to crash and lag. As long as they do not fix the game I will keep this negative rating. I DO NOT recommend buying this game until they improve it.

This game has the potential to be amazing but is let down by both the developers and the community.The servers/netcode is awful. If there is a person behind you and a gun infront of you expect the person behind you to get it.It was touted as DayZ with all the boring bits cut out. That couldnt be further from the truth. This is not due to the actual game itself but due to the community and how they play this game. Don't expect it to be people running about getting into hectic fire fights all across the maps. Instead expect a person to be hiding in the building you enter with a shotgun or expect to be shot at by a guy who has found all the armour and guns he needs in one building and is now sat at by a window.However all this pales in comparison to the RNG that is the loot table.

"Product received for free. PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is arguably one of the most overhyped games to date. The servers are a mess the anti cheat is garbage and the devs are slowly but surely becoming money s that are able to even give EA a run for their money.Before I start on the negatives I may as well list the few positives below + Joining matches are fast due to the high player count.+ Combat can be rewarding when the game isn't lagging.Now onto the negatives which can make this game more unbearable to play after the first hour. PUBG's servers are buggy and clunky as hell. Once landing on the ground your objective is to get into a building or structure and find a weapon to often combat other nearby players however the game lags so hard for the first 10 30 seconds that opening doors and looting take two three times the time it should normally take as the doors take extra time to open and items take several seconds to be placed into your inventory. The buggy servers can also have a major impact on combat which I will discuss below this. The main reason combat is frustrating as hell is mainly due to the hitreg which is abysmal. I've noticed quite often that each time I have been shot on occasion the bullet that could have killed me that clearly hit my chest does no damage to me or the vest which gave me time to get into cover or return fire and kill the enemy player(s). The gameplay can be quite boring especially during midgame and even more so if you dropped in an area with few players in your vicinity. You can avoid this problem by dropping into areas that 20 40% of other players drop off at every round such as the school shooting range. But this often gets you killed and rewards you with few points anyway. The BP/reward system most ing annoying thing about this game. You are rewarded many times more points for placing higher than being active within the game and fighting other players. Thats right. You can camp houses without having killed a single player until you finally die around top 15 and be rewarded with more points than someone who gets 3 5 kills and dies early on for at least trying. Theres no reward for skill only for being a patient buttmonkey. The game is riddled with hackers. One in every five to seven games I either witness or am killed by someone running faster than some vehicles can drive who also happens to have walls and/or aimbot. Battleye recently reported that they banned 25k hackers on PUBG within a day and those are the ones who were being blatant as about it. The game developers Bluehole have promised to exclude microtransactions from this game until it makes a full release. However around 1.5/2 months ago they released microtransactions for unboxing crates. The game developers also listen to whatever popular youtubers/streamers say whenever they witness or are killed by what they believe to be streamsnipers and hackers. I remember reading one occasion where a player was banned simply for driving and honking his horn unfortunately nearby a streamer where he claimed the player was ""harrassing"" him. Countless other bugs and glitches that are relatively minor (i.e. vehicles not flipping if turned on side or upside down UI freezing/lagging not being matched with other random players if auto matching is enabled for duos/squads). These bugs will also not be patched until near the start of 2018 as bluehole themselves have announced. WTF bluehole? YOUR GAME IS IN EARLY ACCESS!In conclusion PUBG is not worth your purchase until the developers own up on their and start to fix everything listed above Don't buy this game under any circumstances even if it goes on sale until these problems are addressed. For most average or casual players it is essentially a looting simulator with a few player encounters here and there but in the end you die 99% of the time. Edit The community is also a carbon copy of the Counter Strike community it consists of edge lords hackers and annoying s so if you dislike that then that is another reason to steer clear from this game.",Not Recommended

"Early access... fell for it again. Best ""br"" game out there but that's not saying much. Going to have to see extreme improvements over what's left of thier ""6 month early access optimization"" in order to recommend buying it. As of now ing around with friends is the most enjoyable aspect of the game. Don't try to take it too seriously or you'll just end of frustrated. Really don't understand how sub 10 server tick rate is acceptable in 2017. May 1st 2018 addition 404 days and more than 712 MILLION DOLLARS later... it's still a hot mess. Yet to see consistent tick rate &gt 30. Somehow they found a way to make the Unreal engine look like junk. Still die after reaching cover still die to super bullets Still see blood while bullets didn't actually do damage Still get projectiles already down range canceled out because the server decided the opponent fired first the list of beta issues yet to be fixed or even addressed goes on...Let's talk about looting. First of all fix the god damned loot tables. Why are there 1000 pistols when you often cannot find a rifle after searching 5+ buildings? This doesn't always happen but it's way too common of an occurrence. They did finally remove clothing spawns but they failed to clarify wether or not they replaced those spawns with more weapons gear meds or nothing at all. More foregrips seriously? Everytime I loot a house and see multiple grips but no gun I add another drop of despair to the bucket. Honestly 2 variants is more than enough. Is this supposed to be ""Jerry's Military Surplus Looting Spree"" or a BATTLE royale game? I don't understand why they don't find the same issue that I do with the possibility of not finding any decent weapon (imo atleast an ump or rifle) in an entire block! Extreme RNG looting should be reserved for ARPGS. Give us some balance.I've given up on hoping for improved melee. Walking backwards is still the hard counter to every melee weapon.My biggest gripe currently is the ingame movement. Why does it feel like complete Why is it glitchy af? Bluehole either needs to work closer with Unreal devs and hire some coders that have experience with the engine or ditch it and give us Pubg 2.0 with an engine they can work with. Idc if I have to buy it again seriously. It's 2018 you've had enough time and WAY too much money to not have came further than this. Movement should feel fluid it's vital to an enjoyable gaming experience.Mr. Greene don't give me that t line ""you can't throw money at developement"" you sure as could have hired 100 devs and weeded out the bad eggs by now instead of putzing around.

I'm tired of having the game perform horribly despite having spent a ton on hardware (overclocked 7700K 1080TI and it's still garbage 50 FPS in the plane really?).I'm tired of having people with clearly high latency connections not having their inputs being taken with a grain of salt.I'm tired of stupid inventory bugs that KILL you because the client fails to pick up an item or the server fails to register that you're holding a weapon. Bonus remember when the developers thought it was a good idea to add latency to picking up items because people who didn't pay attention to how good people play didn't know that they could drag in the inventory instead of using F to pick up items? Seriously? What made the developers think that was a good idea?I'm tired of the idiotic loot tables that leave you with just a pile of clothes vertical grips and P92s while AR shots are being taken all around you.Most of all I'm tired of the excuses. There's just so much broken with this game and because there's no sign that things are getting better it's just not fun anymore.

This will be a very short review as the game is in it's early access stage. The combat feels clunky the weapons are boring movement is pretty good except when you're stuck trying to get over a fence (Yes there will be vaulting in the future) cast iron pans deflecting sniper shots at point blank costing you chicken dinner not to mention having to set the game to lowest of low in order for it to even run smoothly(ish) whenever you're in combat frame rate dips (could depend on my rig) which will make you lose half of the fire fights (note coming across someone camping or having someone run past you) in the end you're pushed into a little circle where the person who has the lucky circle spawn will win. Forcing you to come to a person will get you killed in most cases. I do not think the net code the desync or anything of the like will be fixed when the game hits full release but what do I know? Oh yeah the minute of lag fest before every game (30 minutes of running around and trying to get loot only to get owned by someone) makes me want to vomit.Wait see if there's a change then buy because as of now it's just not that good./EDIT Been putting in some more hours into the game to see if I had given it a fair review and here it comes again gunplay is wonky and boring guns the same mouse movement seems like you've been put in a vat of jelly no idea if there's a hidden mouse smoothing option enabled but it's impossible for me to find a comfortable sensetivity. Hit detection is in one instance you can three shot kill an unarmored opponent with your m16 but literally the very next second it takes you 8 shots. Snake game is boring as leaving you losing an half an hour long WAIT FEST to some placements of the circle and some lying prone waiting for you. 60% of the game is running around and trying to find gear and running from circle to circle 30% is getting killed by someone from behind and 10% is actual enjoyment. Also EVERY time you die and return to the menu you've got to sit through an arbitrary loading screen and their splash screen. Dumb as all hell. Air drops Completely worthless as they're always dropped on the border of nowhere and is just a pvp magnet (which in itself is fine but boring to have to sit and camp this objective for 10 minutes only to have a chance at the new weapon that comes with updates). Loot crates (the ones you can buy with PBcoins) are underwhelming. I've bought 7 over the course and I've gotten the following beaniex2 blue combat pants ((Tbfh skinny jeans aren't combat pants)) baseball capx2 striped tshirt (the one that looks like a Russian Sheldon would've used) white dirty wife beater. And the return on the items are around 30. Given that you have to pay ridiculous ammounts for them and the return makes it obvious that mini transactions are going to be huge in the future. Getting stuck on a corner while parachuting losing the five second advantage you had over the other guy (who for some reason got to deploy his parachute closer to the ground than you) and having him kill you while you're playing with your balls in the air while pressing F to cut away parachute does nothing. Don't count on sound to help you at all nor the visual cues of getting shot it's not very accurate and will leave you scratching your head when you think they're shooting you from the side but they are actually shooting you from behind.Peakers advantage is ing stupid. People shooting and killing you before they even turn the corner. Also the fact that people from fudging Dubai can que on EU servers is beyond . Game is unoptimized. All to be expected. Don't buy it. It's complete garbage.,Not Recommended

After 99 hours of playing solo for about half and duo/squads with friends I can honestly say this game just lost it's appeal after constant updates that took away from it core attraction. Guns are unbalanced lag happens everymatch solo or queued up with friends whenever you play squads be prepared to have a language barrier because you'll have someone from china. Rather than patching region locking optimizing and working on small details the company would much rather continue making crates and now designing skins for weapons. I mean yes it's more realistic than the other Battle Royale style games on the market but for $30 you should definitely be able to play a smoothe game that's region locked updated for the better (listening to the community) and be able to have some decent graphics.,Not Recommended

I do understand however that Oceania has some of the lowest player count out of all the other regions but one things for sure something needs to be done about these asians entering OCE servers.BUGGING AS (occasionally) Stuck on some glitchy walk and unable to run Vehicles insta down a friendly when it gently touches them or they run into a parked vehicle Plane created no sound and your unable to eject from planeConclusion Buy only if you have have friends to play with or your fine with solo,Not Recommended

I have been playing games for over 9 years now. This is by far the worst game I have owned. This game encourages low skill tactics has inconsistent damage and has massive latency problems. The servers run extremely poorly as well as in its current state the game is NOT ready for play. There are multiple game breaking glitches such as textures not loading when you land forcing you to stand outside a house whilst others loot and gear up to kill you. Even the simple act of aiming and shooting is broken. I will click and the gun will not go off I try to aim and the player will refuse to ads. The level of incosistency of damage is ridiculous. I once shot someone wearing a level 2 helmet and level 2 body armor once in the head and twice in the body with an sks and he suvived. I once shot someone without any armor or helmet on with a 1911 3 times and with a mini uzi 3 times and he survived meanwhile 1 scar shot to my level 2 helmet insta kills me. The gravity is also so unrealistic you jump and you're in the air for like 2 seconds that's so long especially in a shooter where every millisecond counts. It also takes your character soooo long to get from prone to standing it's painful to watch. The latency is also so bad I've been shot around corners and through rocks because the servers are so poor. Loot spawns are also sometimes very bad. I once looted 8 houses and the only gun I found was a 1911. You also have to press your face up against a door to open and close as well as it will sometimes teleport you to the opposite side you were on. Sometimes doors also appear closed on your screen however are actually open. I have not yet suffered because of this glitch however in time I'm sure I will. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS NOT WORTH A SINGLE PENNY. Even if it were free it wouldn't be worth the time playing it. Until they remove all of the game breaking issues this game should not even be considered playable.,Not Recommended

The last three games I was killed by hackers EASILY verified from the killcam (Kinda a giveaway when someone kills you with an UZI from 200+ meters away with zero misses with ONE burst). It has gotten to the point for me I can no longer play the game. It just isnt enjoyable. I'm done feeding the trolls at this juncture. Im sure Bluehole doesnt give a **** though since they already have our money. If they are making any attempt to curb the hacking they are failing miserably.At first it was rare enough to shrug off.

As an OCE player PUBG seems like a dead game now. Feels like the proper players (anyone not chinese) have gone to Fortnite now which is unfortunate but I can understand why people have left.Game full of bugs terrible vehicle collision and driving mechanics cheaters and chinese insectoids (they're one and the same) every game on OCE has a chinese bot spamming cheat websites over voice OCE servers have almost no english speakers left developers are greedy inexperienced and lack talent and development direction game pacing is poor UI is unresponsive game is laggy and crashes often loot is bizarrely weighted and unbalanced some attachments are too rare others too common some guns are too rare for what they are etc. Loot balance is so incredibly terrible in Erangel that the map isn't worth playing most houses are completely empty next to no cars spawn. Miramar on the other hand is full of loot and cars but is even worse for pacing and technically a much worse map. None of the weapon attachments have never done what they say they do and when they say that they have balanced something by doing 'x' in reality 'y' has happened. For example after a big patch the M16 was terrible so they claimed they reduced the recoil but when the community actually tested the gun after the recoil reduction the recoil had gone up to higher than before the patch due to the fact the developers have no idea what they are doing.I think this games survival (in the west at least) will come down solely to the upcoming Sanhok map.,Not Recommended

Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the time I had but that was purely because of my mates the game itself leaves much to be desired.When I first got it the problems just weren't really noticeable but it steadily became more apparent over time. Let me list these problems for you. The banning system is absolutely useless the amount of hackers I come across is incomprehensible. The hitreg is just atrocious I have hit someone several times on my screen for seemingly zero damage and the amount of times I've peeked and then returned to cover and a full second after I've gone behind cover I get hit. It just makes absolutely zero sense. The optimisation holy moly is this bad. I previously had an RX480 installed and could only get 20 30 FPS so I upgraded to a 1080Ti and now I get 40 60 like how is that even possible I've got more intensive games than this and they run massively better.If these problems are fixed I will definitely come back to this game and enjoy it again but as it stands it just isn't playable. It has become this game that I play with my friends for short periods of time before I have to quit because of these issues. How this game became so popular with these problems is just beyond me.,Not Recommended

Map design is well done and leaves room for many different types of gameplay styles.I cannot reccomend this game to anyone right now due to hackers bugs and poor game design.A non significant amount of games played have had hackers ruin gameplay by detecting me through a hill or having an aimbot advantage.On bugs this game routinely crashes leaving players vunerable. When players try to restart the game and rejoin it stops loading at the first loading screen.On poor game design the tickrate of the game is significantly below the majority of other multiplayer shooter games leading to players getting shot after entering cover.I greatly enjoyed playing Battlegrounds style gameplay in arma 2 and 3 but this iteration while easier to play is far too buggy and hacker friendly to reccomend to anyone.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,Not Recommended

This game is a lot of fun with friends and could be great if they fix the things that actuallly matter.1) Cheaters are absolutely out of control in this game. Any given game has a 50+% chance of having a Chinese hacker or 5 in it. Nothing like playing through the entire round getting 6 kills only to be killed by a UMP headshot from over a kilometer away while in a building behind a wall.Bluehole refuse to region lock the Chinese players to their own server and allow them to rampantly cheat on every server ruining all of them completely.2) The net code in this game is an absolute amateur joke. Refreshrate of 17hz is laughable. Be ready to lag frequently and die to bullets 2 seconds after ducking back behind cover.Honestly don't waste your money on this game if you have not purchased it yet. Bluehole have shown no real determination to fix the hacking or the brutal online performance of their game and are now trying to get it onto PS4. Thank god Sony shut that down. Maybe now they will focus their efforts on fixing the massive problems instead of worrying about selling more copies in another pllatform.,Not Recommended

The idea behind the game is good and it is very fun to play when things work smoothly unfortunately that is almost never the case because the game has deep problems in the code. It feels very amateurish and it fails on very basic stuff making it frustrating to play because often you die not because of your own mistakes but because of some bug or because the game lagged.I really wish some serious developer would improve on this concept but right now I cannot recommend this game to anyone.,Not Recommended

The initial phase of the hype has been long over and the grim truth of reality has finally set in. The game with so much potential was wantonly wasted through poor patching lack of attention to the community and the most ridiculous micro trasnactions and premium passes. I had this game ever since it was available on Steam and here are the huge red lights I had for this game that at this point I don't even know why I am even playing this game. 1. Erangel was still riddled with bugs a few months into release. There were so many moments where I would die in the most comic ways such as blowing up cars that hit the miniscule objects such as rocks and hills being stuck on doors and falling off of maps proning to heal. And majority of these issues especially vehicles ARE STILL NOT FIXED.2. It takes them almost 6 months to release a new map and the quality of that map to this date is absolutely atrocious. Miramar generally consists of these few places Hacienda del Patron Pecado and San Martin. Rest don't even matter. Los Leones for anyone without a 1060 or RX 580 should prepare to have sub 60 FPS and play a slideshow. For the first few months the entire city was unplayable and even today it's barely better. The rest of the map is a complete joke. There are too sparse item distribution for the players to feel ever sufficient or prepared for combat and the open map ensures that there will be deaths that the player has no proper counterplay. It's the definition of an unenjoyable experience. To make the matters worse they refused to add extra vehicles to the map for ages and even now it's not consistent enough.3. Korean companies such as Nexon have been notorious for micro transactions but Bluehole is sure fighting for that spot with their crate system. While the distribution of the percentages for earning crates is unknown 80% of the crates I have received required a key to open. In games like Battle Royale players always wish to have some form of progression system that distinguishes the experienced veterans to new players. Fortnite achieves this by using their Battle Pass system to grant skins to players who grind the game more than other such as the John Wick or the Max Omega. PUBG doesn't believe in the progression with their crate system and the Premium Pass. To talk about the crate systems the possibility that one gets a good drop even on the paid crates is pitifully low so there isn't even a gaurentee that spending money on the game will grant the player good cosmetics when in Fortnite there is no luck involved in progression whatsoever. The Premium Pass was the nail in the coffin for the attitude of Bluehole for many players since MAJORITY OF THE COOL COSMETICS EXPIRE BY THE END OF THE PREMIUM PASS DURATION. What is the meaning of this? Compeltely disappointed at a game that could have been a major breakthrough but managed to be put six feet under due to lack of management and terrible developers.,Not Recommended
Developers are too Busy spamming players with advertisements and delayed content to fix the servers which range from a tickrate of 8hz 17hz. (for comparison CS GO has a tickrate of 64 and people still complain that is too low) The core game is great but desync and hacker majorities are ruining the game.,Not Recommended
I enjoy the game but devs are too greedy.,Not Recommended
"I have a GTX 600 series card and this ""1.0"" status game crashes consistently mid game. I can rarely ever go one game without ctd ing. Also why have a region lock feature when it doesn't even work? There shouldn't be people from Asia in North American servers. That creates unfair effects via latency which just aids the horrible netcode in placing errant bullets in your player's head. Currently my game won't load past the title image and I will re install for the second time. Should be a refund.",Not Recommended
"The gunplay is some of the most satisfying I've ever played in a game and that's why I keep coming back to it. But the developers are so inept that even months after ""leaving early access"" the game still feels like a buggy mess with constant desync game breaking bugs and poor optimizationthat. I simply can't recommend buying it.. I keep hoping that one day PUBGcorp will get their act together and fix this games issues but they seem to be more interested in milking it for as much cash as they can get at this point.",Not Recommended
Good idea so far executed terribly. For one the netcode is horrible and when added with chinese players entering the North American servers it only makes the issue worse and gives them an unfair lag advantage. The game also needs some serious optimization and this is coming from someone with two gtx 1080s and of course SLI is terrible and runs worse than using a single card. I'll keep updating this review once they introduce patches that improve the experience.Update Still filled with cheating assclowns SLI was completely removed server tick rate is still crap and the game as a whole is a bug filled mess.,Not Recommended
Dont even buy this game if u dont have 1500e PC or game just wont run for u. U will try everything and anything but still game will lag even if u manage to fix everything with your current pc u still need at least 16 gb ram and SSD ( no ssd no texture at the start). At the end when everything is working u will play against cheater that will kill you no metter what in top 10. So final thought is if u like tourching yourself this is the right game for you.,Not Recommended
Prior to this game's actual release the game was fun. Put in several hundred hours of game play in this game do to how great it was. Only ran into a few cheaters once in a while and you actually had a decent chance at winning if you had the skill. Since the release of 1.0 all you see are Chinese Hackers on this game where they see where you are every time and doing various other cheats. This game is now absolutely horrible. You can't enjoy the game due to fact you get killed by some Chinese person hacking. I do not recommend this game anymore until they fix this issue with all the cheaters.,Not Recommended

Can't recommend it at the moment as there are too many things wrong with this game.For starters we have the poor performance. Yes it's an open world game with high render range but even then you have games like The Witcher 3 which not only look better but have a lot more going on at the same time while running much much better.Next the gameplay. This is subjective because I just can't seem to find the 'hook' that catches my interest and to keep me wanting to play the game. I don't like having to run around a huge map looking for loot just to get gunned down by some random player whom you never saw. Just not my cuppa tea.And the bugs. It's like you've walked into your long dead grandmas' basement that hasnt been cleaned in 10 years. That's how common they are.,Not Recommended
Good GOD. Until they region lock China this game is horrible. I've just played this game and no word of a lie EVERY. SINGLE. SQUAD.

Despite the fact they have their OWN bloody servers they decide to join our ones NA EU OC etc. English speaking servers right?

Complete garbage...stillI really want to write a good review for this game for the same reason I keep coming back to play it...because the potential is definitely there. I keep hoping against hope that they've in some small regard improved the sluggish gameplay. However every time I come back to play (a couple months break in between) it's still the same blah game. It has the same sluggish feel...kind of like you're in a bad dream where you're running really hard and not moving anywhere. This is how it feels during any various aspect of the game picking up items running around jumping (OMG...jumping!) aiming shooting driving (uggh...driving!)...and on and on. Basically every aspect of the game feels like you're floating in a ball of Jello. The hitboxes are a freaking disaster. The game is full of glitches and bugs. To have a game now exiting BETA and becoming mainstream on both PC and Xbox...and to have it be this awful is almost embarrassing. I actually do feel embarrassed for PUBG Corp.The one thing I can say is good in the game is the sound. The environmental and positional sounds in the game are fantastic.

I had to edit my opinion about that game... Basiclly i said good words after my first 400h of this production but now i wanna change my mind. First of all DESYNC... yeah i know it might be hard to fix all of desync in such quick fps games but desync in PUBG is like shoot wall get kill shoot body get blood effect without damage and basiclly desync is a majority of evry bad things what you can find in game. Ofcourse after couple months devs cannot remove some weird buckets flying across Po i etc. weird textures map glitches places where you can stuck and die... There is too much this sh** Now when i write this review i have about 600h and see evry fu**ing bug/glitch/issue here ingame. But yeah add some crates add new map &lt &lt &lt DO THIS MOREI believed in this game much more than others but now its just another random game in my library which i can play and spend hour to see how this game is falling down.Edit 01.05.2018Still think that my review of this game should be negative even when devs now starting care much more than before to improve game. Game is better than before (i mean release 1.0 and couple next updates) but still there is many things to get better like netcode desync loading loot while sitting in lobby not few seconds after landing and propably more and more...Last review was like 10/10 worst game ever now for me it's like 5/10 (higher equal worse).Maybe there is some hope.,Not Recommended

For example how does a 45 acp shot beat a 5.56 at 20 meters? Or a shotgun shell beating a 7.62x39 at 20 meters? This game does not make sense it has terrible rubber banding on the test servers.I would rather play dayz and wait for the beta next year than have any hope that pubg will get better. It is cancer.

For how terrible this game is it should be 100% free. There's a ridiculous amount of cheating and it will NEVER be fixed. The devs are only concerned with making money at this point and have no interest in trying to make the game better. TL DR Fun for a bit but the devs are a joke. The game has so many problems that will never be fixed. The combat will never be smooth ever.March 3 2018 Still can't recommend this game. Everything about it is so arbitrary.The main part of the game is literally the least fun part of the game. The combat is beyond awful it's unbelievably bad. Comat Arms had better hit boxes and hit detection. You'd think that the full release of the game would fix some of the performance issues but Bluehole has actually managed to do the complete opposite. The FPS lag in buildings make the game unplayable at times.Let's weigh the pros and cons for a moment.Pros New map is fun and there's a good selection of weapons.Cons Combat is so so bad. It's laggy and inconsistent and it's just not fun. Looting is literally more fun than actually fighting people. Hit Reg is probably the worst in any game I've ever played. It's so arbitrary. You could shoot a guy 3 times in the head and he could live. It's laughable. Servers and movement are still super laggy despite them releasing 1.0. The FPS lag in some buildings is a joke. It's so so bad. I use a quality HyperX headset but the audio in this game is terrible. It's often impossible to know where shots are coming from. High amount of cheating. Encounter cheaters on a regular basis.This game could be so good but it just isn't. It's like they've put time and resources into every other aspect of the game but the actual combat and servers. It's the worst part of the game.Hopefully Fortnite or another Battle Royale kills pubg.EDIT Shot a guy 3 times with a Kar 98. Twice in the head once in the body walked away completely fine. Awesome.

Love and Hate PUBGFirst I want to say this is an alpha review my opinion may change in the futureOverview I the concept is amazing jump from plane scavenge and survive your way to victory.Great ideas Varied weapons weapons addons map is awesome and getting better with revisions the constantly shrinking area of combat.Meh Sound is ok but could be better they may work on this. Shrinking area of combat constantly leads to huge advantages and randomness vs. winning by skill.Bad Amazon Cloud services is not complete issue it's the physical locations of these cloud services in North America. They have no Amazon Cloud locations in Canada or Northern United states the game servers are virtualized and not dedicated and they don't allow for you to setup dedicated to play on. I feel like there is two games of pubg the one's that are close to the cloud server areas and the ones that are not I live in Central canada and the ping times seem (50 80ms)ok to the amazon cloud but I believe there is massive server issues of optimation and virtualization (Dynamic servers do not do well with Virtualization) that really compound with the medium level of lag to make your game feel like your playing 150ms 200ms ping (old school dialup). They try to hide it with interpolation but you can tell by the rubberbanding and no look instant engages (your running after a guy instantly turns and fires at you you don't see it and it's not a cheat it's server code that allows him to look but does not let me know visually that he is looking at me)Sound Creeping and camping You can't walk quielty enough for ppl not to hear you even in a large firefight it leads to the sitting and camping guy having the advantage so you get this hurry up and wait game that happens over and over it's just who can wait the other one out there should be a super low speed walking function that can't be heard from 20 ft away secondly some materials should make it quieter to move through. Your in giant windy field of blowing grass but the guy 30ft to the right can hear your reposition a foot.Right now I do respect the genre and I really want this game to succeed but if they can't get away from the amazon servers and add more servers in a northern environment after selling 4 million copies I can't recommend for now.

This actually my first review. This game is so terribly bad it actually made me want to write a review. I have a pretty decent high end system and specs that have handled any game I ve thrown at it while on the highest quality settings. PUBG however runs like absolute garbage!! After doing some research and reading other reviews I found that I m not the only one having that problem. This is especially infuriating when 30 seconds into the game you die because the lag is so bad you can t even defend yourself and most of the other players are using cheats or plain trolls so don t give a crap about being a decent player. Use lack of weapons and vehicles to the point which makes the game purely a game of luck instead of skill. You have to get lucky or be able to see the future and land inside where the circle will be hope and pray there s actually weapons there as well or you WILL die trying to get to the circle because there s no vehicles to get you there before the circle kills you or you will die on the way by either someone using a cheat to be invisible or because you have no weapons. With that being said I think this game has HUGE potential and could be one of the best but ONLY if they fix the connection issue. Make weapons and vehicles more readily available and eliminate the people making it no fun for anyone else. As of right now I strongly do NOT recommend spending any money on this game or playing it at all for that matter until some serious changes are made. If you like the battle royal style and haven t played it yet I highly recommend getting Fortnite. It is also early access but for one it is free! Two it actually can be played and runs VERY smooth. Three there is ample supply of weapons and materials to actually be able to play the game for more than 30 seconds. Four the players there are decent humans and play by the rules without cheating like the people in PUBG. That is all.,Not Recommended

So as you can see I have put more than 1500 hours in this game. Let me say that originally this game was great yes it had it's bugs and it's hackers but you got to play on a map you enjoyed. The games were more evenly matched than they are now and you generally had a good time playing. Fast forward to June 2018. This is no longer the case. After taking out map selection the game quickly went downhill as their continued push to force people on miramar increased. Not only did this cause them to lose a good number of their players they didnt seem to catch onto why people were leaving. Brendan was very vocal in the beginning about his no lootbox policy. This has quickly changed as the game now has no good clothing options unless you pay more money for this game. The game has become a money grab for Bluehole and will likely die out due to a company who does not listen to it's community while at the same time adding more and more lootboxes. The games gunplay mechanics are wonderful. Unfortunately due to its management's lack of interest in the cause of it's declining daily player base this game will die. They have shaped the game towards new players and getting as much money from them in the first couple months as they can before they end up leaving. This game has its moments but as I and my squad continued to try and get on Erangel in our 14th game attempt we decided to uninstall and leave it for good. Bluehole will likely go bankrupt due to its lack of quality management which means that no matter what you do in this game its only a matter of time before the servers shut down and we lose all out virtual crap. Bluehole is seeming more like poohole. Thanks.,Not Recommended

Product received for free. Terrible game. Nothing works need to use third party programs to tweak visuals so you can see people. If you don't use them you're at a disadvantage. Same with audio. Need to tweak settings to ACTUALLY hear EVERYONES footsteps not just a few random people (You can always hear your teammates 100% of the time walking. Other people sometimes you can sometimes you can't). They band aid fixed rubberbanding by increasing everyones latency by 200 which makes hit reg horribly rng.In 3rd person on NA servers you get about 16 hackers every round. We're talking full esp wall hacking headshotting spinning 360 headshot from 500m out without scoping with a pistol without scoping or adsing. They can choose to set where the circle ends or choose just to know where the end circle will be. They can instantly use meds without the channel time they don't need to wait for boosters (Energy drinks Pain Pills) to heal. Usually a booster heals over time slowly. They use speed hacks jump hacks teleports.The maker of the game says he will not attempt to curb the rampant Chinese hacks because it would be racist as not all Chinese hack. It would also reduce game sales and player count if he did.After all that when you do try to shoot someone that isn't hacking that you see and that doesn't see you they're hard to hit because you have 200+ ping and they have who knows how much cause 60% of the population playing is Chinese and have ???+ ping to the server. They can kill you without you ever seeing them aim at you or stop moving. On their screen they stopped and crouched and popped you in the head/chest 5 times and then reloaded and carried on. While you were standing there like a dumbass whiffing shots at where you THINK you saw them. And thats if they're not hacking.Not to mention the tick rate on the servers is bad as well which makes the game even more sensitive to higher pings.If you do find someone thats not in your group from NA playing on NA you group up and try to kill the hackers that are remaining in the round cause you're in the top 10 somehow.My friend bought this game for me and I want his money back.

Nah dude this game is an unoptimized sh*thole that contains more cheaters than legit players from what I HAVE seen. This does not mean you have seen them it just means I HAVE. The game also gets extremely boring after a week of playing. I have a lotta hours in this game and can not find any reason for you to buy it. 99.99% of the time when you are being shot at you have nooo idea where from and it is super annoying. another thing is that this game is super overplayed on twitch I perrsonally no longer can watch some of my favorite streamers like Lirik because they are playing it.

"Product received for free. Before I start off this review isn't fully negative. Honestly would give this a 50/50 recommendation but (for now) I'll have to give it a thumbs down until I see improvement.I found this game to be pretty fun especially with friends. I have no experience with other battle royale games like DayZ or H1Z1 but from what I've played the game it's mechanics and in general was just a fun game to hop into and see what sorts of you can get yourself into. The game is very hop in hop out if you loose/die with no penalty aside from maybe a hurt ego or disappointment.The game offers only one map which the plane flies over on a different trajectory each time meaning you'll most likely not land in the same places. I found each new game/round to be unique to it's last with some rounds being action packed intense fun to slow (and sometimes boring) ""waiting for stuff to happen"". Each new game was pretty diverse. ...Now onto the bad of the game.The game isn't well optimized which can make even decent pc's struggle to keep a steady fps. Certain mechanics or actions (I found) lag spiked my character and this overall poor optimization is biting at me since if the game wasn't poorly optimized I'd probably be really enjoying myself.Aside from fps issues there's also some audio static/stuttering with certain sounds vehicles and even gunshots with just detract to the rest of the experience as well. The game is still in early access (and people are quick to jump to that defense) but these days I have trouble accepting it as a plausible excuse as things such as general optimization should be fleshed out before a game is released to the public.All that being said Some people have reported having little to no fps or sound issues and the developers seem to be constantly updating/patching the game so only time will tell where this game will end up. As a final verdict I say hold off for now at least until they fix all their major optimization issues. However if you have the money to spend and the game does interest you then I suggest buying it trying it out (to see how it performs with your rig) and then decide to return or keep it based on your experience on it.tldr The game can be fun (especially with friends) but it's constantly being contested with it's poor optimization.",Not Recommended

Game's dead by the end of 2018 latest and let me tell you why.Edit It's been a while since I wrote this review. Now in March 2018 the game has lost the monopole of a good BR game with Fortnite Early Access on the other side. I can clearly recommend to anyone who wants to play a rather tilt free chilling and fun game Get Fortnite first. If you like it MAYBE try out PUBG. If you dont like Fortnite MAYBE as well try out PUBG. Games are totally different from the way you have to play them to actually win Fortnite is a lot more fast paced wild and hectic compared to a rather slow gameplay in PUBG. PUBG has a rather more realistic setting (can't say PUBG is realistic but in comparison to Fortnite this is da real stuff) but as well a slower movement mechanic. Fortnite offers the feature of creating cover right when you need while in PUBG you are caught in the open when caught in the open. So you are forced to think about your next step next move or next shot a bit. Might be a game for some high level tacticians who are calculating every possibility and then decide where to go and what to do. Yet problems I mentioned in the review are still there are still relevant to me. The issue with the community is something you hope to have it resolve itself but I think it has become less cancerous nowadays. Anyway read below for the shortened version of my review or even lower to read the full review. Thank you. TL DR I've been playing since the closed beta did enjoy it very much even with its bugs. Those were annoying sure but not as annoying as such a huge community with mostly stupid far too young and cheating people. The reasonable good and nice players have become a minority just as in CS GO. A community this big an anti cheat system banning players after they have played 150 hrs+ and a horrible launch are beautiful signs of self destruction. Money has been made the game can die slowly now. First The new map YOU CANT DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO PLAY IT?! Way to open there is no cover no structure no chance to play the game in your style. If you like to go for a slow approach loot and chill you can't. There is not enough loot on the borders of the map or in smaller areas to have a slight chance of reaching even top 20. If you like to rush for kills like an idiot again a loot problem. Luck has always been a factor but on Miramar you need more luck than gamesense or skill to kill others. If you want to have a smooth mixture of going for the kill and staying patient you're either getting gunned down by a rushing dude you've never seen or heard before thanks to so much other noises on this map or your getting sniped from 300 400 1000m. Probably with an AK. Silenced. 8x. The new map has so many flaws you can either chill in a house with a shotgun to win the game or snipe yourself into madness. Once your position is given away you're immediately getting by 3 4 people shooting at you from a fair distance. Seems like fun nah thanks.Second It's been getting worse since I started playing. Every now and then there was a patch or an update older bugs have been fixed (sometimes) and new have occured that made it worse to play gave you worse performance or ended up in some other bullsh*t. The game has crashed frequently since then it still does way too often for a launched game and it always will crash. The Patch Support is there yea. But it's like not supporting that much sadly. A little Gameplay Side Note So when having a brainstorm on other negative aspects I noticed that the gameplay totally suffered over time. The decision to make a spray pattern completely unpredictable was so weird in the first place and made rifles right from the start a nice yet weak option. But implementing Marksmen Rifles (SKS Mini 14 ...) made Rifles so irrelevant. You won't need a rifle to win the game you could aswell go with a marksmen and a pistol/SMG. The marksmen can deal anything 10m+ everything below is pistol job. You can spray yourself into oblivion with any Marksmen as they have way too much ammo in a mag and a natural high damage output. Don't get me wrong the Marksmen have to be this way. They are fine but rifles have become to weak to be valuable nowadays. You need way too much time and effort to fully equip your rifle they are inaccurate and have flaws from 100m+ all this making them irrelevant on the new map Miramar. Lastly The community has gone down to the wire dear guys. Or has it? I have been experiencing so many far too young players far too stupid and far too lucky players lately. Surely there are still many nice people out there but the pure mass of players streamers fans and haters and therefore as well cheaters has made this game AIDS. And being killed by a lucky HS getting screamers and squeakers in the plane and those people screaming like they're getting bitten by a million snakes in the ballsack is... no words... (YES there is a mute function NO I am often playing duo or squad alone and therefore need to hear random teams talking) Let's have a quick mindgame (I'm making up numbers based on experience and for the cause but they are actually close to reality) In average you're getting contact with about 10 people in one single SOLO Q game out of 100. You've been playing a lot lately and now you're taking results this is where the fun part starts assuming you haven't made contact with anyone twice and have had every single player each once in your lobby. This will result in having played against 100% of all players but only having made contact with about 10% of them having died to only 1 % of all players. So no matter what's your experience with ingame community is it's wrong. I'm therefore wrong as well but the amount of times you believe to have been killed by a cheater seems to be so high. At least it's been for me this way this is just a personal non fact opinion. Whoever read until here thanks a lot I appreciate you withstanding my long and painful view to the great game it has been once. Right now I can not really recommend to buy it but if you're starting the game now you might make different experiences than I did. I'm pre caught by the time in the closed beta might be influential yet reasonable. I will still continue to play it every once in while and when the fun kicks back in I'll have this review edited.

So this game has many ups and downs. I would first like to start by saying if you enjoy Arma 3 Battleroyale you will most likely not like this game. It completely lacks realism things like bullet penetration bullet damage bullet ballistics armor deterioration and pretty much everything else that was good with A3BR is brutally skewed in this game. That being said the more cartoonish nature of this game does make it much more accessible to the average player than A3BR. Beyond that this game is quite bad and I say this having logged many hours. Hit detection is awful lag is constant (regardless of the server you choose) hackers run wild with aimbots and vehicles can be completely unpredictable. It could be possible to enjoy the game if this is was your first swing at a battleroyale style game but for anyone that is expecting a rewarding experience I would advise to look elsewhere. Hopefully Bluehole can fix a lot of the bugs before they release the game but even with flawless performance this game would be medicore at best.,Not Recommended
Here is how the general game of PUBG works for those who are interested in buying. (Don't Do It) Spawn in with friends at a distant location and gear upFriend gets 3 kills and leaves the stragler behind to tell his talesWe travel as a biker gang across the map to which i get a crate and get a dope sniper and a ghillie suit. Bush mode activatedWe stay alive as only 4 groups remain. Ours includedWe secure a spot at the outer perimeter of the 3rd circle to kill stray virgins5 seconds after securing location all of my teammates get downed instantlySuprise elite sniper coordination?

I love pubg however there are a few critical things that need addressing.First of all there's the Chinese problem. And no I'm not being racist but it is severely impacting every mode of gameplay.Solo You see ping abusing in multiple games with not great netcode. Most of them however fix that issue by either region locking or otherwise. It has been getting increasingly frustrating landing muiltiple point blank shotgun shots and then getting taken out by a pistol.Hacking is also a major issue. It's reported that 99% of pubg hacks come out of China and that is extremely noticable even in NA servers.When asked about region locking the brain dead dev playerunknown said he wasn't going to promote xenophobia in the form of region locking Chinese players to AS servers. This is a joke.In duos and squads it's also an issue. Although this one is preventable by joining pubg LFG discords sometimes you just want to play squads or duos from the games. 90% of the times I've chose to do so my entire squad only spoke Chinese. Given that communication is the major aspect of the team gamemodes it destroys the experience.My second and major gripe with the game is the stupid map. How difficult is it to implement a preferred map setting? Miramar (Desert) has a much higher play percentage which means that it takes upwards of 10 Miramar games to find one Eringale one. This leads to players getting burnt out of the new map and stop playing due to it. This includes me. I had to join and leave 13 Miramar games just to get one on Eringale earlier today. I joined the game and got killed almost instantly by someone very suspicious. Hopefully Bluehole can actually listen to the community as games like Rainbow 6 and the battlefield franchise has done or their game is going to go all the way down the deep end and sit with H1Z1 as bigger better BR's come out.I will not be playing this game until these problems are addressed and frankly I won't recommend it either.,Not Recommended

Graphics looks like a slightly updated Arma 2.Gameplay/gunplay is sluggish and unresponsive.Game is poorly optimised even with a high tier pc and settings on very low it can still drop a lot of frames in a lot of different scenarios.The genre has been done to death so there is little to none innovation.Its a singular gamemode on a single map so I think the amount of content is very limited.Microtransactions in a early access games is always a delight to see /s.A lot of the game consists of hiding camping and looking at enemy pixels while in third person view.Buggy as hell and the servers often crash forcing you to quit your session.Something feels wrong when one of their most anticipated updates consists of being able to vault over walls and objects.Pricepoint of 30 euros seems to be to 10 euros too expensive for what you are getting.Edit Also the UI/Interface is really outdated/bland and not very intuitive.,Not Recommended

Now you can just get ban for 7 days if you kill some popular stream sniper by being accused of stream sniping wihout any solid proof seems like regular player don't matter. Streamers generate value so they are more important. Remember kids everyone is equal but some are more equal than others. PUBG choose their side along professional streamers over community.

Most of the game's early access problems have been solved except one Mass cheating and server hopping by Chineese players. For whatever reason Chineese players choose to play on NA servers and teamkilling any non chineese squadmates. They also make up the vast majority of Cheaters. The fact that cheating is so widespread like this is ridicoulous. When players asked for a region lock (a very reasonable request) the devoloper responded by calling us racist. At the very least they should be forced to play on their own server. If not for this problem the game would be Alright.

This game... This game here... It's okay but has many issues... It is like a family member or friend who has some issues metally either that be literal or figuratively. Now you want to hate them but you can't because that would be wrong you either know that person has potential or you know they have a better side to them and that is exactly how this game is. Let me make a list of all things wrong with PLAYERUNKOWNS BATTLEGROUNDS. 1. Server Latency issues... At the start of every game I always get lagged back and forth running into things and getting killed this even sometimes happens a little later on in the game. 2. Client Side BS. You will die a lot 95% of said deaths will be when you jump behind cover while in combat and even though on your screen you are behind cover to them you are not and yes it is very annoying. 3. Camera controll and bugs. Many times I run into a choppy camera or a camera that goes into my characters head while aiming down in third person which has proved to be my downfall... 4. Content Now there is lots of content but little verity in play area so the game gets very repetitive at times and makes it feel like a drag to play. 5. Gun play is good but bad now I am saying its little BS that gets you killed like when switching over to the left side camera your left hand does not hold the gun so you end up shooting a wall and not the Jack in front of you this is more annoying then it sounds... This game is both amazing and trash I would wait to get it as I have faith in the Devs to improve the game over the early access time it is not a product worth $30 at the moment please people wait for a more improved better game before buying this golden trash.,Not Recommended

The game itself is great! It's a lot of fun when everything works out the way you want it to (i.e not randomly getting oneshotted in the face from 200 meters away). However the game is faced with a disgustingly huge issue optimization. This game runs like complete garbage on my $650+ gaming rig. The game is plagued by frame dips and pushes an undesirable framerate even at the lowest settings. PUBG is extremely buggy as well. Some of these bugs are hilarious but there are some that are legitimately game breaking bugs in the game that anger me beyond belief. The most significant of which is the game's failure to load in textures for the first 30 seconds to a minute and a half of game time. The buildings are inaccessible due to this which causes gearing up to be absolutely impossible. Opponenents who spawned near you can of course pick up weapons and then kill you. The only option is to land in aspot with little loot and just wait the full minute and however many seconds until you can grab scraps. It's dismal the bugs need to be fixed and the game needs to be optimized or I'm going to be done with it. Now the good new is the game is only in early access which means that the game is probably going to be cleaned up within a few months for the official release. I dearly hope this is the case and the developers keep at it.,Not Recommended

I don't really give a crap about the paid content and I get the concept they need to implement the system and test it while the game is in early access... why not just make the paid crates free for now. Call it a bonus for kickstarting the development of this game by spending $30 on an unfinished game. I'm sure they could still limit how many you get by requiring the winning points still to get the crates and just give the keys for the low low price of $0.00.For this reason I'm jumping on the hater bandwagon and downvoting. Doesn't mean I won't still play it probably... but it doesn't deserve the high praise it used to that's for sure.,Not Recommended

"Let me start off by saying that this could be a great game *could* be if only it had been produced by an actual game developer. The general idea is sound and the emotional payoff if you somehow manage to win is great. But it's all spoiled by a chronically awful... well everything else.The game dev(s?) have taken a game engine designed specifically for FPS games (Unreal Engine 4) and somehow miraculously managed to make it the most unsatisfying FPS experience of all time. Bluehole? More like black hole because you'd have to be a collapsed neutron star to suck this much at anything. Like really it must take some next level wizardry to conjure up something this terrible and get away with occupying the top sellers list for so long and very nearly get away with a GotY award. Shame there's no mention in that spellbook of such arcane words as 'netcode' or 'hit detection'.""Walking simulator"" the steam tags say. Well they're not wrong driving? Have fun tripping over a pebble on that perfectly flat looking piece of land doing a barrel roll and killing your entire squad. Combat? You'd have to be some special kind of insane to want to engage in any of that where the melee consists of... well it doesn't and the ""gunplay"" consists of a lucky draw of ""who shall the almighty netcode RNG gods favor today?"".Did your bullet which you saw clearly go through someone's eye and splatter blood everywhere actually hit? Roll a D20 and find out.Are you actually safely behind that wall hiding from the player rubberbanding around like an acid trip gone wrong? Probably not.Did you actually pick up that weapon you already clicked on 4 times? Try again.To all you prospective purchasers I'd suggest you wait for a AAA company to inevitably produce a battle royale game of their own. But if you're still dead set on getting on all this 'action' maybe try auditioning for scat videos instead at least that way when you're pretending to enjoy eating s**t all the time you're getting paid for it.",Not Recommended

"Pro Good game concept Fun co op game Challenging tactical shooter in which cover really matters Rng loot and end game locations Large arsenal of weapons and vehicles to use Revive/downed mechanic Thrill of winning gunfights or getting chicken dinners is uplifting afCon Obviously the netcode Constant stuttering freezing or just outright server lag every game Single gamemode 30 dollar pricetag very little variation from game to game Bluhole admins incorporating the zero tolerance policy and twitter bans Cheating. So much cheating Hitboxes/hit reg so many times ive shot people in the feet only to find their helmets broken or lost fights entirely after seeing 4 5 blood spurts Game rules are not defined Servers crash or go down on occasion and no not for maintenance just randomly. Happened to me at least 3 times in my 30 or so games Weapon damage seems like a roll of the dice I constantly get killed by a single bullet from AR's or snipers yet whenever i shoot someone it seems to take 4 5 to down i understand that lag and such play a factor but this happens nearly every game i play and is just unacceptable i drew the line after getting one shotted by a kar98 in a moving buggy with a level 3 helmet and full health Vehicle collisions are downright stupid almost always leaving one vehicle untouched whilst sending the other flying to god knows where Spectator mode is broken whilst watching a teamate ads or sometimes just move showing them aiming at a completly different area then they actually are 3rd person viewmode gets very very ""cramped"" so to speak whenever you go inside a building giving the player very poor vision of anything surrounding them switching to first person is even worse as it feels clunky and nonresponsive Optimization. I know its been said over and over but this is a major issue that bluhole is facing nearly every player suffers from it and it is so incredibly frustrating to go from 60 fps on a game like gta 5 on ultra to 30 on pubg on low not only are you sacrificing the looks of the game which tbh are not anything special but you are barely getting anything from it afterwards Helmets. This point is much more a issue that i experience and do not think most of the community will agree but imo the way that helmets should work is that the helmets durability should replace the health of the players head meaning that if taking a headshot with a helmet the helmet gets damaged whilst the player takes very little or no damage from it until the helmet is destroyed pretty much a head pan with durability. i feel as though this can be balanced by lowering the durability of helmets but even with this being said helmets of levels 1 and 2 can only stop 2 3 bullets (in my experience) and this imo is not in any way unfairWith that being said the list is concluded for now. I believe i have addressed most of the problems the community have faced as well as those that i personnaly face whilst playing the game. I am however very dissapointed in bluhole for not fixing these glaring issues yet for goodness sakes its july and i still cant leave the plane without my game freezing. This game has been the top seller on steam since the day it came out making millions whilst being in early access. The only game i have ever seen do this before was the infamous Dayz standalone. Fix these issues bluhole get competant admins we in the community know damn well you have the means the rest is up to you and for s sake dont fall to the same level as Dayz.Edit So i've just recently learned that bluehole have decided to push out their paid cosmetic cases and such in early access before they completed the game. I honestly had hopes for this game but this was the last straw there is no other way to blatantly show how little they care for the community and how much they care for money than this completely taking a on their promise not to do this until the full release. Bluhole has made it clear they are in this for the money they may say the money goes to their charities and tournaments but thats t to date they have sold over 6 million copies at 30 dollars each before the game was even complete. Thats where the money for these tournaments would have come from if bluhole actually gave a and didnt just care about milking the consumers for every penny they could. At this point we should just expect the games development to come to a sudden halt down the line and playerunknown will dissapear just as rocket had did.",Not Recommended
For the following reasons I cannot recommend this game Article explains this rather well http //www.pcgamer.com/paid crates continue to be a contentious issue for the pubg community/Please read this one the title can be misleading. I completely agree with the ban but the fact the developer allows other more popular streams to get away with it is asinine. That is all covered in the article http //www.pcgamer.com/another pubg streamer has been banned this time for taking advantage of a glitch/They havent changed anything It only got worse. A popular streamer was using the water glitch where you can shoot into the water at swimmers without them shooting back and wasnt banned. The developer has released contradicting statements about banning with the more popular streamers being above the ban hammer.

Game was released in January but in fact still in Beta. Same old story with bugs glitches connection drops with no possibility to rejoin. Cars seem like radio controlled jumping on every hill and turning handsprings like Tony Hawk on his skate. Tickrate is awful you can run round the corner but then get knocked because this is how this cybersport game works. Devs care only about money releasing tons of cosmetic items and don't fix major bugs that negatively affect the gameplay. Game never changes last updates we added new weapon we reworked textures of palm trees on new map we added rubbish into the houses on new map.

The game was selling with all content available in game with no microtransactions planned few months later developer openly states there might not even be a way to get the items in game once it officialy launches!

Doors sometimes don't open when you click them. Entering a vehicle can take 2 3 clicks. MISERABLY optimized. Frames fluctuate badly at ""very low"" settings. The ""skill"" of combat often comes down to who was lucky enough to find the best loot / luckily end up in the best position.

So if playing to win gunfights will be far and few between and half of the bullets are blanks (12 gauge to the face should kill at 5 10 feet one would think). The weapons are otherwise great in looks feel and attachments but where's the fun in a shooter if you never shoot?I also can't believe a serious cash tournament was played on an EA game (again) which is still unfinished regardless of the ""1.0"" update. They added a new map when the original still has issues. The Xbox release is also quite a mistake but what can you expect from such a small low budget developer looking to get rich and famous quick?The original ArmA 3 BR mod was much better.

Product received for free. The developer on multiple occasions has gone exactly against what theyve said they would not do and continues to ignore more important issuses and game breaking bugs in pursuit of making the most money before all the interest dies. I cannot support or recommend this game or any game in the battleground/hungergame genre. They all end up the same either never fully released or released in a broken state and abandoned for the next cash grab.This isn't an issue of developers needing to fund their game they've already made so much just on early access that they could complete the game within the next two years fully funded with no microtransactions. Microtransactions were intended to increase the longevity of a games lifetime meanwhile the devs introduce them in its infancy which makes it clear that they are aware that the life is going to die fast and hard and as soon as streamers stop playing the game so is everyone else.Rather than fixing issues and making the game function better or have more replayability they have opted to artificially prolong the game in a way that allows them to put in minimal effort towards completing the game and ride out the popularity till them and the game are forgotten.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you in any way support the gaming industry and dont want it to stagnate because developers can get an easy way out of finishing games,Not Recommended

"5/10 I love the game and I really do but the game is becoming because of lag and fps drops yeah I know that they are fixing it but one common problem which I rarely encounter is the hackers I have only seen like 10 hackers in the games from when I started playing the game which is a good thing (thanks bluehole for that ) . And now the new map is coming which is great to play on but with it ""Event Pass"" is coming I think it's like Battle Pass from Fortnite . I don't like the idea of that because the game is already pay to play where Fortnite is free to play so it's alright for Fortnite to have a pass for cosmetics .In PUBG it seems like the pass is not only for cosmetics but also likely for the new map. If you wanna buy the game buy it when they fix the fps ping and likely remove the idea of the ""Event Pass""Otherwise the game is great .

"Soo the game has been ""released"" in 1.0.. but it's not anywhere near ready for exiting pre alpha. Ingame combat is a combination of desync and lagg.

This is a fun game if it wasn't so broken. 1. The lobby. I cannot tell you how many times I have had to click restart lobby due to the game not registering that my party has clicked ready up. How this is still an issue is beyond me. That a fully released game which is pushing micro transactions on you and forcing you to buy keys for crates while ignoring performance issues is this broken is unacceptable.2. Desync &amp lag compensation. Read every other negative post. You will hear the same complaint described 500 different ways.3. Hackers. Ever been snap head shotted by another player through a forest where 50 trees are covering any aspect of your hit box but someone can lock onto your head and fire back to back shots with no recoil? Or had a flying car chase you as the hacking group does a Harry Potter drive by? Or been shot from a guy across the map in a closet with a double barrel staring at the wall? This game is infested with hackers. Things have gotten better but it s still frustrating that all this anti cheat client software PUBG comes bundled with isn't working.4. Lack of optimization. I run a pretty beefy rig but the game engine is so poorly put together it can't take advantage of anything. You would think with PUBG using the Unreal Engine 4 a proven game engine that they would be able to make something decent but that is too much to expect.5. Paying for keys for locked crates. Greed. Pure greed on the developer s part to get any money they can out of you.6. Constant stream of cosmetics. This company needs to realign its focus. I understand different departments are at work here but from a community perspective how does pushing more and more micro transactions look when content and QoL patches are sparse and often end up making things worse than they originally were? The game should be stable and optimized before moving onto sucking the community dry of all its money for cosmetic pieces.7. China #1. If there was a game out there that would make you xenophobic against Chinese people this is it. They love to crack games and use any cheats or mods they can to get an unfair advantage over you. Apparently it s a normal thing in their culture. 8. The PUBG v. Epic lawsuit. What even. Do some research. This developer s line of focus is so misconstrued with its priorities. See above points for where the developer does or does not focus its attention. They have a track record of choosing the wrong front to fight on and the fronts that need attention being routinely ignored. Closing This is a good game. The developer had a great foundation and did well on initial success but they have failed to capitalize on that success and are losing its player base essentially PUBG is just riding on their initial success and taking all that momentum and driving it into the ground. Fortnite while similar but radically different has taken a large share of PUBG s player base and when CoD launches later this year with their battle royale I d imagine that another chunk of the player base will move on. This game is slowly dying out granted it while retain its die hard player base but as you can see from user counts from now to this time last year the count has dropped significantly and will continue to do so.,Not Recommended

If you buy this game you will regret it. This game has become so popular due to the concept.#1 Most of your shots will not register. Most gun fights are a roll of the dice. Streamers get put in special queues. The game will not work this way for you. It will be insane lag 100% of the time. The netcode on this game is the worse I have ever seen.#2 People will be teleporting everywhere. Again lag....#3 I have a GTX1080TI /w 32gb of RAM and an I7 3770K. I run the game on very low settings. I get framerates as low as 20FPS in game and as low as 10FPS when streaming.#4 Redzone will non stop appear. They are very loud you will get a headache. They are very pointless and they not only cause people to camp they kill people randomly for no reason. The airplanes are so loud they will give you a headache. The cars are so loud they will give you a headache. #5 Due to the reasons above 90% of your time in this game will be completely wasted sitting around waiting to join games land and insta die due to lag. That is if you want to fight. If you do not want to fight you can land in the middle of no where and sit around for 20 minutes until you see someone. Either way you will be completely wasting your time.#6 The game randomly closes itself. Even in the middle of battles. I have warned you. If you buy this game you will regret it.

It's been said countless times by devs from game after game that they will be different from the rest. They come with promises that are often changed by a little greed.Until the team at Bluehole reconsiders their announcement of csgo like loot boxes this will remain a No.I can't recommend this game to people as I won't hold responsibility for the developers actions when they go against their word.Games aren't like they used to be and developers need to realize that.,Not Recommended

I'm not quite sure where your priorities are atm. You seem to favour streamers over your average players. But guess what? We paid for the game just like they did we are ALSO your customers! You need to re evaluate your admin ranks who clearly seem to be on a power trip as of late banning people for no good reason. The sheer amount of overturned bans this month speaks for itself and proves that. Your so called admins right now are giving you a bad name. Don't forget without us the player base you are nothing.

"The PUBG massacre.Okay at the start this game was amazing... nobody can argue with that.It was one of the best thriller games the feeling when it's the 4th circle 20 people were alive was fu*king scary... any moment you could get your penetrated...But this game took a super quick nose dive to ing *TRASH!*. Many people say it started to become since 1.0... but for me it's from the day they released the first tournament crate that needed to use keys. They said ""keys are meant to raise cash for the tournament"" but they penetrated us and started to sell crates... then gave a masive shoutout to Fortnite. by saying Tl Dr""Hey Fortnite you! you made a game some what similar""6 months with basically just a bit of fixes and only *CrAtEs!!! *Then Xbox and Mobile release... kool but please keep PC alive.then they released couple of weapons and cars... still Mada Mada... as they used to release like that like hot cakes when the game was in early access.Then current time arives. Samhok! Good ing map it's actually fun (comparing to another map ) )but 2 ing problems 1) the battle pass. like sake... it was a 100% copy from Fortnite... let's compare. Fortnite Game is ing free the pass takes 12 weeks items are perma. Costs? both Cost 10Eu / USDalso to get the items without the battle pass you need to play 28 days straight everyday at an average 6 hours.Now let's see what PUBG Does that Fortnit'on't. Costs 30 EU. gives crates that require to buy keys (and it used to fun to sell on the marketplace. It was a nice addition it gave cash to people who played the game a lot and kept it alive to spend money on other games or ++ their looks.2) The ing lawsuit... like are they in' dip ??? they gave even more publicity to Fortnite and thank god they backed down... but they lost the trust of their consumers and please ing downvote this game to infinity.It's suprising how they can get a game from 90% posititve to 30% ... that is bigger talent than it was required to make this game.Now please downvote this game to infinity.

I really want to enjoy this game which is why having to give it a negative score saddens me. Most people read the negative comments to find out what exactly is wrong with a game. Below is my list. Movement and combat both feel very floaty. Neither are particularly responsive. There also seems to be a slight latency between the keyboard press and the action. These often make me feel like I died in a situation where I would've been fine in any other game. They're also the reasons why I'll be getting a refund after posting this review. Playing is more frustrating than it is fun. Even a high end PC will struggle to reach proper framerates. It is an early access title but people should be aware of this. If you're playing above 1080p then be prepared to put all the settings to low in turn making the graphics look nothing like in the screenshots or even downright hideous. 30 is too much for a game like this especially in this state. The game shouldn't have been released yet. One can tell that this game will take some time before it is complete. By that time the popularity may have died down and most people may end up just experience this broken and frustrating version.I also have one particular gripe regarding the game mechanics. It's not the only one but early access generally smoothens out these things. Camping is too powerful. Once you have obtained the equipment you need you're better off avoiding other players rather than fighting them. This may be more realistic but I would still make it so that players are rewarded more for their kills.,Not Recommended
"This game makes me sad because its potential and room for infinite growth has been stopped dead by the developers lack of concern with the state of the game. Playing since the first day of release I have seen this game grow and become a phenomenon however it has become clear that the devs have become out of touch with its players. The hacker problem has killed this game for me amognst other things but the devs never seem to outright address the issue instead implementing vague ""anti cheat measures"" in each new patch which seem to do next to nothing. I am hopeful that a region lock feature in the near future will help bring this game back to its prior glory.

This Game Sucks optimalization ? i have from 1 fps to 110 fps ... how is that possible ?! at start where are all players i had like 90 fps ... when i jump from plane it drops to 1 fps in landing ... the most immportant time /start/ you can have pc that you will be able to run modern games at least at lower settings ..... but without lag .... not pubg i can play ARK survival evolved without any lag large map tons of wild creatures but i cannot play pubg that have way worse graphics . and map i guess at same size i can run GTA V . For Honor but pubg optimalization is like for one type of graphic card only ...Shooting system ...i like shooting games but this is really something that do not fit to me im not even talking about slow bullets and insane bullet drop i want to say that when you shoot with sks you fire a shot scope goes up and when you pull it down and directly to target and shoot really quick even when you have enemy in aim it wont hit him becose recoil is made the way that he won't shoot where you aiming. and when you shoot with kar98 you can notice that you aim and when you shot fire than the gun unscope and reloads so you can harder see where the bullet landed .... shoot watch the bullet land than reload and shoot again that would be awesome just hold right click and release it when you need to reload ... Connection who from europe would like to play with Asian players ? its not racist ... but there are lot complains about china hackers .... Vehicle bugs who never died by accident by stepping in or out from vehicle in slow speed ? ???? it does so mutch damage . and bike with control combination of keys ? + copied cases from cs go to make more profit and if they learn from cs go developers they will not care about feedback they will keep low anticheat and maybe even making game worse like you will go slower with sniper rifle or any heavy gun + you need to switch to eng keyboard becose if you are from other state you probably doesnt have 123456789 at top of keyboard / yes you have but you have main setup different / like czech people have +Ä›Å¡ÄÅ™Å¾Ã½Ã¡Ã­Ã© and we cannot setup this symbols instead of numbers so we need to switch to eng keyboard all the time ... without using numbers you cant use mouse wheel to change weapon when you are scoped .... graphics of the game sucks and still it needs better hardware than most of games with better graphics .... even when is there large map there are lot of games with huge map and great graphics with lower base hardware components The idea of the game is great but i cannot imagine to make it worse way only if they would make it peer to peer connection like for honor did .....,Not Recommended

Summary Unoptimized garbage. Do not buy. Play Fortnite instead or get one of those new battle royale games coming out of AAA studios.This game had so much potential all wasted due to the lack of effort from the developers. Where do I even start? PUBG is full of game breaking bugs Chinese hackers and to top it off the devs keep introducing new (not to mention useless) in app transactions. This is the first PC game i've ever played to employ TEMPORARY PREMIUM COSMETICS you pay real money for cosmetics that just expire after a period of time and have to be bought again.The battle pass introduced isn't worth it either. If only the devs could focus on fixing the game there would be some chance of it being able to compete with the rest out there. Textures don't load till a couple of minutes into the game even on hardware running at relatively higher specs. The game physics break hard and often. Cars go flying. Grenades go through walls. Recently there have been server desynch issues as well.Honestly at this point i'm fairly convinced that Blue**** is only trying to milk the game to the last of its moments and has already given up on trying to save/salvage it. Hence save your money and go get something else.,Not Recommended

I like this game I really do. It's fast enough paced to pick up for an hour (games last 0 25 minutes). Unfortunately all the fun you can have in the game is literally taken away from you at the most annoying times with constant frame drops CTD's and even hard locking (steals cursor alt tab does not work force restart is required).I would be OK with a lot of this but it's a 25 early access game the developer should reconsider his price until the game is more stable.EDIT Returned after 7 months of not touching it after hearing about a new map and Xbox release. I thought that perhaps it was out of early access but no still the same thing. Unoptimized (varies between running perfect for me to barely running at all) buggy unplayable mess that is overhyped simply because every other attempt at a Battle Royale game has been worse. It has no competition therefore it can be just good enough to pass and frankly it is JUST good enough to choose over Arma Battle Royale. This is all it will ever be marginally better than the worse out there.Don't waste 25. You will be disappointed hell it might not even run on your rig as it seems hardware/driver compatability is touch and go.,Not Recommended

Oh I haven't written a review for PUB GEE? Well here goes.I can't recommend this game to begin with due to how shoddily the whole thing is put together. I don't tolerate crap and just because I've had a few entertaining experiences with this game it doesn't mean I can just say 'get the game you'll love it'.PUBG is kind of like smoking. People smoke because other people are doing it maybe just as a social kind of thing. Maybe you're one of the outliers and you do it because it 'keeps you calm' or some such but whatever I'm not here to talk about it. This game is like that sort of oddity where a bunch of people are playing this game just because other people are playing this game.I can respect some aspects of the game I'm not gonna say it doesn't have redeeming features having basically copied note for note most if not all of the gunplay elements from ARMA III (a series in which Bohemia Interactive have been attempting to perfect the military simulator) the FPS elements are at least tight and work okay. Hit boxes lag compensation and such are up in the air but considering this is a game that connects 100 different people from who knows where in the world to one server I think you can forgive some of this stuff.However I'm not gonna forgive them for making an Unreal Engine 4.0 game that runs like a complete dog looks like a game from 2004 while it's doing it and punishes you when you turn up the graphics by basically making it harder to see by adding more foliage and such. So you might as well play on the lowest settings anyway even if it looks like crap. Enjoying the scenery after all is pointless in a game like this.My PC sure ain't top of the line anymore I'm running an AMD 7990 (yes the dual GPU card) and an i7 3770k. Not like awful can I can play Doom (2016) on the maximum settings at 60fps. That's sure not amazing and I bet a more modern system might do better but with PUBG wowee on the absolute minimum settings possible I barely get 60fps at all and even then I get spikes of 50 and lower when I guess slightly too much is happening on screen.Let me talk a bit about the experience itself some since that's kind of one of the highlights. It's okay. Most of the time you just sort of doddle along and occasionally you pick off one or two guys by yourself. When you play duos same sort of thing but you'll be fighting more duos and squads. Sometimes maybe you'll be able to take down a couple of duos on your lonesome but squads might be out of your reach. Now once you're playing squads you're really in the serious PMC sort of territory where you have to start playing serious if you want to get anywhere.Winning is random. Sometimes you get great circles! Sometimes you get awful ones and you're hiking across the entire map since of course the game refused to spawn you a vehicle. Sometimes however... you're in a squad with two friends and some guy you got because nobody else was around. Then you just happen to get some great great circles some fantastic gear and all kitted out you go and face the last dozen guys. Maybe you tag a few you don't really lose anyone then all of a sudden you win. It just comes out of nowhere. It might feel good but it'll always be a surprise that first time.The excitement you feel after that first win can never be matched. Yeah and I mean it too you win again it won't feel the same. You'll just be kind of satisfied maybe. By the time you've won a dozen times it won't even mean anything anymore.I understand this game's in early access. Yeah I get it. Maybe if they ever finished the game and made it really great I could give em a nice kind review. But that's not right now so for now I say Stay away from PUBG. It's not really worth your money. If you have to buy the game play some games win a match stop. You'll feel better for it.,Not Recommended

It's definitely trying to be H1Z1 KotK 2 but it changes quite a few things.It's got a huge map a pretty good weapon variety with a good amount of attachments for each the vehicles are more scattered the hit reg is pretty solid and there is an attempt at some realism. You need to add the attachments to your weapons in your inventory you can lean to peek around corners movement feels a bit realistic and you can blow out the tires on the vehicles. Playing with friends is made better through a ready up feature and also when you're shot you don't die right away so that your friends can revive you.The map is very big so there isn't much time to loot gear and outrun the shrinking boundaries you can often get killed before being able to spot the enemy switching guns can often bug out and leave you with empty hands waiting for it to fix itself and there are long load times when leaving a match.,Not Recommended

After a long time of being out the developers are still refusing to fix the bugs that are in the game and instead are set on releasing new content. Sure new content is cool n all but the framework for the game is a buggy mess so what's the point?

"Okay so i have been playing for almost 500 hours with little to none beiong AFK and this is my review. To start there are 2 types of ways to play this game A.) You play for thrill of the kills B.) You play to win even if its with 1 kill we'll come back to this later. I first started playing this game un aggresive and landing/running away from anyone I saw. I ended up with a few wins in my first month of playing this way. As I got better I started landing school and got a few kills but would later be killed by a camper. I would be mad but accepted the fact that people played a diffrent way. But playing recently I realized pretty much anytime I die in TPP/FPP it is due to a camper. The 2 gameplays don't mix well and rewards players B for being scared and being ""smart"" as many campers will tell you. When they added war mode I had much fun just killing not worrying about the end result but that was quickly ripped away from us. Talking with the community many people don't enjoy the game and feel like it is an obligation. There are many things this game can fix/add to make the experience enjoyable for everyone but decide to add new maps such as mirmar which is a disgrace to PUBG. Overall there is to much to say about this game and after buying it and playing for so long I would recommend your better off saving your money and just watching Shroud play. Please let me know small or big things that bug you hopefully Player Unknown or BlueHole see this and take all the suggestions to save the sinking ship.",Not Recommended

Well...I play on 200ms stable ping to EU and in nearly 90% of my Death Cam views I see that I get shot to pieces before even being able to fire off a single shot however on my view (whilst alive) I am under the impression that I get in many shots. The game even shows blood and bullets being emptied. Can someone kindly just explain to me how the actual F...U...C...K am I supposed to have any chance AT ALL if my view shows me actually shooting whereas I basically just die without ever having a chance?It is mind boggling that such differences occur in the same game on an isolated and pre cached server. It is making it absolutely unplayable and totally unfair as I will only have a chance whenever the server dictates it.Adding to that... It is pathetic to see such a big company who have made absolute millions not being able to fix errors. Look at some of the other 15k + negative reviews made recently all pointing to the same thing...Let's add more Cheaters... Oh my dear sweet baby Jesus there are an insane amount of cheaters in this game. In any given day I report around 3 6 people and occassionally when I log in (6 times already and look at my play time) I got messages that the people were banned from the game.Let's recap $30 for unfair and totally luck based hit assignment and lag tide in your favour with the added option of getting headshot whilst driving a boat or car from 50+ yards away thus rendering your gaming experience absolutely horrid... Let's define PUBG You pay in order to stand an unfair chance against cheaters and legit players alike all whilst making you believe you actually stand a chance...

Edit 2 (9 months after intial review) Every point still stands. Servers are better yes but chinese players are still rampant. Before the increase of tickrate you couldn't really tell if the person was lagging or if it was just pubg being pubg. The increase of tickrate makes it insanely obvious that this game should not be clientsided in hit registry. Playing AGAINST chinese players is now unfun as they're able to hit you after you've been long in cover because hey it has clientside hitreg on their laggy end they could see you still in the open. I understand region locking china would not fix the issue because of VPNs being a thing but maybe match people of equal ping? Make hitreg serverside like CSGO? Lock chinese players to a specific client like CSGO?Edit Another thing to add against buying the game is hackers are now becoming successful in their attempts. Before they might hack at the beginning but near mid game they'd get banned leading to a fun end game. Now they can last the entire match insta downing you from across the map with shotguns. Also you'd thing that playing the game on a weekend on NA servers would up your chances of finding English speakers but no it doesn't matter what time you play the game you'll always get Chinese speakers.Unless you'll enjoy playing solo or have enough friends to play squads or one to play duos with I would not recommend buying this game. Most of the players you get match maked with speak Chinese leading to no communication in a game that really does require it. Unless they add a new client to Chinese speakers to exclude them from invading NA servers (CSGO style) or somehow region lock them out of playing Duos/Squads on NA servers it's not very fun to play. Most English speakers on NA servers tend to not group with randoms for this very reason leading to almost no chance of finding anyone that speaks your language.,Not Recommended

PLAYERUNKOWN S BATTLEGROUNDS is a badly made battle royale game which is pretty much the same as the other battle royale games on the market but is even more of a 'sit in a tower with a sniper rifle and wait for people to walk past' simulator than the others (H1Z1 for example).Firstly PUBG is ridiculously overpriced for what it is especially when all of its competition is free to play. PUBG should cost half of what it is now at most if not free as it is still a glitchy mess riddled cheaters and bugs which is also why it shouldn t have been released as a fully completed game the fact that it went out of early access is just so that Bluehole could grab even more money than they already had with such an expensive game. Secondly PUBG s maps are far too big for battle royale as you will play for 30 minutes or so only to get shot in the back of the head by a sniper so can t even see which I find to be extremely frustrating and a massive waste of my time. There isn t really that much more to say about the actual game as it is just spawn and try and kill the other 99 people apart from the fact that the graphics are quite poor considering it was created in 2017 there s nothing that sets it aside from other battle royale games apart from its weapon attachments.Finally Bluehole shouldn t have added micro transactions so early in the game s early access when a game adds micro transactions it just shows how money grabbing that company is and Bluehole isn t an exception especially with the game s ridiculous price as I mentioned earlier. Also the fact that PUBG now dominates the steam market with its mostly worthless skins annoys me as it makes it more difficult to find things that I m looking for.In conclusion PUBG is rip off considering its price and I don t recommend this game for primarily that reason it's also the only game I really regret not getting a refund for.P.S the new map (Sanhook) is ugly and looks amateurishly made it is also just another way for Bluehole to suck in money.,Not Recommended

After about 30hrs on my steam account and about 50 60hrs on internet cafe my opinion is The game was on early access when i bought it.At first i thought that the frame drops and graphics lag would be fixed on the stable version of the game.But sadly the game became worse than before.The new map lags more than everything on the planet.The Fire Rate is also very bad.I shoot somebody with a shotgun twice and didnt died(he had only level 1 vest).Then he shot me 1 burst time with m16 and i died.When I tried that I found that it is impossible.The map takes 30sec 1min to load and play smooth.The Driving is also bad.I Was Driving and Suddenly the car crashed with no obstacles in front of me.Then the car exploded and i dead.My first game was Win.After then i always lose cause of game bugs.Conclusion +Shooting Physics+Multiplayer Fun+Battle Simulator(kinda)+No Cheaters Until Now Physics Bugs Lag Too Much Hype For Nothing4/10Not Even Worth The Money,Not Recommended

Honestly I really want to like this game since its one of the only modern br games there is but its just awful. Constantly dying from things you just cant see strange scenarios where your bullets dont land but theirs are heashots. Honestly if your thinking about jumping in now dont. People are just absolutely insane at this game and there are also hackers that just run rampant since in game loot can be very valuable on the steam marketplace. And on top of the 30$ price tag you can now drop an extra 10$ on an in game pass for cosmetics! yayyyyy,Not Recommended

It's H1Z1 Battle Royal but with god awful performance terrible loading times (in terms of objects and scenary) and horrible movement as well. This game should be priced at 14.99 not 26.99 for a game that's far from being finished.Edit So... The game comes out of early access despite the fact that it's still in early access because it still has god awful performance issues cheaters with of course lootcrates and microtransactions being shoved in there. Considering the popularity and the amount of money this game has made you would think that they'd hire top talent to have all of the problems fixed?Nope. Despite the fact that the playerbase wants China region locked to decrease the high level of cheating the main dev's response is pure cringe and illogical its clear that the main goal here is to get as much money as possible whilst the popularity is still high. He calls people who speak out against this xenophobic despite the fact that he's completely unaware that China is NOT like the western world. I'll just leave it at that...This game hasn't gone on sale/been reduced once either. Of course why would they need to if people are going to buy it anyway right?I would stay away from this game even if you do want to play it with friends. There are much better co op games out there than this pile of trash.Brendan you're a greedy shame to the gaming industry.,Not Recommended

Bad bluezone change. I understand the intention of making players focusing on whats within the safezone instead of whats still behind them. But the change to the first few bluezone is totally unfair. It significantly reduces the time of resource gathering for players far away from the first safe zone and thus giving the LUCKY players within the first safezone a high resource advantage. Please at least increase the vehicle spawn rate for places away from the first safe zone.,Not Recommended

"While it's a fun game to play and I enjoy it dev's approach to development pisses me off. The game is an absolute winner in 2017 with over 15 million copies sold but Bluehole still struggles to hire proper developers and uses monkeys instead.Each morning when I commute to work I go through my Twitter newsfeed and what do you think I see? ""We are aware of the server lag"" ""We've fixed server issues"" ""Servers are now back"" and whatever else they can come up with excusing themselves for shtty server performance. The current development team is absolutely low skilled and they don't know how to solve issues with the game. I wish this game succeed even more but until the current team is still there this will never happen.

So bought this game last year in September or something.It was pretty much nice those days with it's gray colours game felt right unreal engine game. I played it once which was a whole new experience then again then again game kept changing it's course. It was pretty much fun. Met a lot of people even made some friends from the same city.But still game was incomplete optimization sucks still but for the sake of gameplay me and my friends kept playing this. While the game kept updating on weekly basis it was nowhere near of optimizing gameplay. Not to mention the netcode and desyncs. I kept believing that they would make this game better i used to play this game in high ultra settings with 50 60 fps. Last i play this game(not recently) i couldn't get stable 60 fps on VERY LOW settings. Then i stopped playing this game hoping to return to it in the future when they would get their heads out of their butts and fix this game.But my nephew 14 years old boi played from my account and pc. So few days ago he was playing. And ran up to me says they banned me. I was outraged obviously my neph didn't knew how to cheat teamkill or abuse to get perma banned. I checked forums bunch of people got banned because of their anti cheat malfunction. In the end they unbanned me but i highly doubt i would be ever returning to this game ever.That's my 2 cents on this game if you want to spend your money on this game i would suggest spending it elsewhere hell try free battle royale games.P.S. Did i mention all the cheaters in the game running around with aim hacks ?,Not Recommended

It's a shame that the mobile version gets to have the training mode and arcade mode permanently whereas the main game does not have any I imagine how the hell are the newer players going to improve. keep on camping like every other these devs need to realize that not every player is shroud and the game indeed lacks content but I believe it lacks the necessary stuff that will allow you to improve more weapon practicing stuff needs to be added first After that newer content should be added and events like war mode be made permanent if the map selection is going to be a issue set it on random if it's still an issue set it to 1 specific map. As long as community custom servers are not mainstream with training arcade mode and war mode not permanently added sadly i will not be recommending this game to anyone.,Not Recommended

My time with PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds has been a mostly pleasant one until the last few months. A little while back I began to notice the huge influx of chinese invading the EU and NA servers. They enter into our lobbies screech at the top of their little lungs and start ranting about F**king Your Mother. Worse yet they bring over some of the worst forms of hacking humanly possible like wallhacks aimbot speed hacks and recoil hacks. They have no regard for our servers and come into them lagging out of their minds and murdering our people leaving us wondering what happened. They also do not care if they ruin our experience because their servers are some of the worst I have ever played on. Hackers on every game obnoxious chinese screeching that may sound quite hillarious at first gets old when all you hear are a bunch of Asian people screeching out of their minds that china is number one.

People silently sprinting at me doesn't seem right in terms of the footstepsDoors Opening doors seems way more challenging than it should be. Far to often do I open a door only for it to slam itself shut again. Closing doors will just open them the other way about 20% of the time. I have even seen doors that appear open but still need to be closed and reopened to go through. Melee just don't you basically need to be inside someone before you are close enough to hit them and even then its 50 50.

If you are a streamer PUBG will bend over backwards to make sure you dont bad mouth their game If you are a normal player you better not do anything suspicious to streamers or here comes the shadow ban hammerPlus Broken promises of no monetization until launch but i guess that was a lie,Not Recommended
I don't support the practise of broken promises to the consumers when they are doing something for their own benefit. The fact that they prioritised monetization over fixing bugs in early access is beyond me especially with the introduction of new bugs that have developed after that update (connection problems and invisible buildings) which I have experienced personally in addition to banning players for using those bugs when it might not be intentional.Also they suck up to famous twitch players by giving them freedom to ban whoever they want. Yes stream sniping is bad sportsmanship but they know the risks of going in to those games and it is hard to enforce this as you don't know who actually might be stream sniping or honking for that matter (everybody honked when that patch came out....) and who's not. The game is fun and was showing promise up to this point but the dev's need to sort out their priorities especially during Early Access.,Not Recommended

optimised and it was good at the start,Not Recommended
It s laughable the current state of the game Desync and nonexistent hitreg seem to be something usual. The terrible framerate is still there since launch. The huge number of cheaters looks like is not going to decrease any time soon. You will get at least 5 26.1MB updates a day changing nothing. The devs decide to add more loot boxes instead of fixing the game. Oh and the lawsuit that PUBG Corp has filed against Epic Games for copying the game is ridiculous. They're crying just because other developers are more consistent/successful so they want to monopolize a genre Wow Let s see if you will also file a lawsuit against EA and/or Activision/Blizzard.,Not Recommended
"I've done multiple reviews on this game. The game is fun if it works correctly. Other than that if it doesn't you're gonna have a bad time. De sync and hackers everywhere. Unplayable most of the time and let's not even talk about the FPS of this game. Most of the time it's dropping a lot especially when you are about to fight someone. Guns also don't work correctly. You can shoot someone multiple times 2 seconds before they see you and they turn around and kill you with an SMG? What happened to all my other bullets that i shot?I did buy the vikendi survivor pass and while it does give some pretty nice cosmetics the missions are way too long and tedious. The thing is most of the time you cannot do that task more than once per game. Sometimes you have to repeat dropping in the same spot 50 times before you can actually achieve something in a mission.Daily missions also expect you to play 6 hours a day to get anywhere most of the time at least. Although i do like the ""progression"" in this game the way to progress is just annoying and not feasable. You need to spend way too much time for something you pay 10$ and have access to for only 2 months.In conclusion fun game if it works right ( which it doesn't most of the time because of ping and desync ). Other than that completely horrendous. If i was the CEO of PUBG CORP i'd delete this piece of garbage and make it again until it's completely right.",Not Recommended

"(wall of text TL DR its fun with friends but not worth $30 for being MP only and having awful core optimization/mechanics) I really have to give this game a thumbs down but do be warned that it is after 200+ hours of gameplay. PUBG is hands down the best battle royale game available but the problem comes from core gameplay being unreliable most of the time. If you are looking for something to spend $30 on and get hundreds of hours out of this game is for you. If you are looking for something to be competitive about then this is NOT for you. The main pro of PUBG is that its fun to play with friends and is a good mix of tactical and fun while having relatively short matches and offering a variety of experiences. Everything else is a Con. The optimization is laughable the servers are unstable the hit registration is worse than early CSGO matchmaking and to top it all off its infested with hackers. The game is touted as being ""e sports ready"" (yeah its a meme now but still) while being a game based nearly entirely off of RNG. Get past the bugs and at its core PUBG is still just playing the lottery often times you will be frustrated to have looted entire sections of cities while receiving nothing but low level equipment and no spectacular weapons only to be killed by someone who managed to find a sniper rifle and 4x scope. As a player who enjoys a competitive experience I simply cannot play this game for more than afew hours at a time before becoming annoyed with the nigh impossible situations constantly thrown at me by the game. I also simply cannnot play for more than afew hours at a time because the game will crash or have some other catastrophic bug causing the client to become unresponsive or getting booted from games without the option to rejoin. To conclude its great to play with buds (but thats only because there arent many AAA co op options out there right now) its unoptimized and its basically playing off of the common human gambling addiction to keep you looking for that great loot.",Not Recommended

Game was looking promising but even if they got 100 millions $ selling an unfinished game they still decided to prioritize making more money with t microtransactions instead of focusing on improving this game. You shouldn't buy this game unless they decide to change their policy.

Don't put your trust in these guys.It still has so many bugs updates are taking a ridiculous ammount of time to come which is unacceptable considering how much money they got for developping the game.

"The game is more luck based than skill based. And the RNG factor here is bigger than in some ARPG equivalent. In order to shoot and hit someone you have to go through approx. 4 RNG rolls Did the server recognize you shot?Does the server recognize the bullet they insist must be made to fly and travel?Did you REALLY hit him as well as on his and 5 other random players screens?Does the server feel like removing equivalent amount of health remove a random portion or leave it be?Once these calculations are done you are then prompted with a brief ""f*** you"" and you die... somehow...Needs a WHOLE lot of work not worth your money now probably won't be later either.",Not Recommended

Great concept for a game extremely fun to play ruined by rampant cheating. If the devs decide to ever deal with the cheating seriosly this game would be one of the best games I have ever played. I don't play the game a ton maybe 3 4 games a night several nights a week but the fact that I get put in a squad with a cheater at least once a week speaks to the shear number of cheaters you have in the game. Although it can be slightly entertaining to spectate someone who can instantly heal spin 180 degrees and headshot another player with a Kar 98.Note to devs while banning cheating accounts is a great short term business move (I'm sure you've made millions on cheaters simply repurchasing the game) the actual loyal player base will eventually give up on the game and it will end up like MW2 a game where the competition is only about whose hacks/cheats are better.,Not Recommended

Honestly this game is far from done to be an early access edition. its a fun gameplay but there are so many things wrong with this game. Bugs hit registration stuttery gameplay server issues etc. just when you grab some nice guns in the game and you walk out the enemy shoots you and your dead. its a bit frustrating dealing with people in the game. You have alot of Team killers who end up ruining the gameplay as your reaching close to the end just because you dont have a mic or they need weapons so they kill you with a shotgun or whatever. This game has alot of things to be worked on in terms of it being an early access. As for now this game gets a one star from me.,Not Recommended
Absolutely horrible constantly crashes and that isnt even the worst part about it the crash reporter is even laggier than the game itself consumes 1/4th of the power google chrome already uses of ram which is completely idiotic considering how simple that should be. Physics in the game have absolutely no effort put behind them if you walk down a 10cm ledge it can either throw you 5 metres forward or just kill you. Car mechanics... I dont even want to get into that but ill give it one example you drive into another car one flys 200 metres away the other one glitches under the map. What bothers me the most is the absolutely S**T system that you cant even choose the map you want to play literally what the hell is that. And thats not all the system behind it is so awfully made that you can get the same map 50 times in a row because the devs most likely dont even understand how to make something switch every time a person plays 2 maps is it really that hard to make it 50/50 if you are so incompetent that you cant inplement a system to give players a choice which map they want to play.. Also most selling game of 2k17 or 2k18 i dont know and i dont care the money you have made from it should be enough to develop 50 different games that all work flawlessly but instead you just wh*re the hell out of that money and dont even use it for the game development.

tbh there is way to many things wrong with this game combat is mediocore at best and the driveing is terrible.

joke game,Not Recommended
words can not describe how dissapointed i am in this game. it got so much praise so much respect and so much fkn money yet after all this time the game has been out it is still one of the worst looking most poorly optimised glitchy and hackerfilled games currently on the market. Lets just put all the hype this game has received aside and look at it the way you would and other game.The movement mechanics are pure trash. there are free games that handle movement better. i would prefer csgo level movement mechanics to this an open world game where a small bump can cause you to stop in your tracks then you jump but for some insane reason you cant jump forwards unless you have forward momentum so you jump in place... gta does it better and its literally a joke how bad gta does jumping.The weapon mechanics. Leaning is next to useless bullet drop and weapon kick are so so different from any other game and so unlike anything you can expect that most gunfights consist of constant misses with people squinting with there tounge hanging out there mouth until enough shots hit. you can be a GOD at any other fps/shooter but this game will throw you for a loop everytime. this alone does not ruin the game and if the devs really want to have a weapon system like this then fine while it may not be for me or alot of other people some may enjoy it and in that case all i have to say is that its a little clunky in comparison to just about all AAA titles. It was very frustrating however spending 10 min looting just to potato someone for my whole clip and die for the first 50 hours or so of game time.The servers the optimisation the glitches the crashes and the hackers while being significantly improved since launch are still very obviously present and in my opinion have not been improved nearly enough for a game that is still bringing out entire new maps and weapons and has so much money to spend on making the game worth the hype. Dont be fooled by the statement that there is seperate teams working on fixes and new content both teams are apart of the same company and the talent has been assigned by that company if fixes are slow delegate more staff to the team in charge of it. saying there seperate is not an excuse.in conclusion the game in itself has received so much praise that people including me for the first 200 hours ignore the issues with the game but when you really think about what makes a good shooter game PUBG just does not tick enough boxes. I cant tell you how many times ive thought 'its just because the game is in early access and is new' but it has been long enough and the painful truth is that PUBG just doesnt measure up.,Not Recommended

"17/11/2017 UPDATE The game is now again riddled with hackers. I recently played 2 games in a row and in both games I was killed by a hacker. The first was speedrunning around the map and autoaiming people's heads the second instantly killed me with an M16 that was firing 4 5x faster than humanly possible I could tell by the sound.TL DR Avoid this game if you are a competitive person. There is too much RNG and too many bugs for anyone to take this game too seriously.As far as I'm concerned this game wont ever get a positive review from me. There are just too many issues that the devs don't care about and instead of fixing them they'd rather add cash boxes to the game to suck more money out of us. Pathetic.My main issues with the game are below 1 There is no real anti hack implementedThere are WAY too many hackers in this game I would say over 10% of the population is using some type of ESP aimbot or antirecoil macro I've had them on my team when I have queued for a group with strangers. It is blatantly obvious because their cursor will immediately move towards the head and they can lead shots on vehicles with insane accuracy. They can headshot someone running up on them that they didn't know was there until half a second earlier. I would honestly say I come across a hacker every 3 4 games. Can be quite annoying being killed by someone who knows where you are without you even moving.(UPDATE 11/7/17) Hackers are still very common now they run around racking up 20+ kills per round with no punishment. The leaderboards is littered with them.2 The developers ban people on the forums for expressing any type of distasteIf you look at other reviews there are quite a few people being banned for stating that there are too many hackers and that it is unacceptable. Seriously devs you're going to ban people from your game because they show interest in seeing it improved? Pathetic. Stop doing this. (I know it might not be all devs but having any devs that do this is unacceptable. Remove them.)3 The game needs to be optimised betterThe game crashes spontaneously even on the best of cards. I've posted threads on the forums and reddit about it and these crashes seem to be affecting everything equally. Running on lower graphics seems to help FPS but not the crash issue.(UPDATE 26/5/17) Performance patch helped a lot but still much to be desired!(UPDATE 4/6/17) Performance is better but crashing is still FAR too common I'm talking 25 50% of games end in an abrupt crash. Also the server's latencys go up and down making for an inconsistent experience.UPDATE 27/7/17They are now adding microtransactions to the game when they promised that would never happen. As far as I'm concerned this game will never receive a positive review from me if the developers want to nickle and dime us.____________________________________________________UPDATE 28/7/17 SummaryAfter over 160 hours played I can safely say that though this game can be addictive and it can be fun I do not recommend it to people based on 4 reasons 1 There are too many hackers and they only get punished when people post video evidence. I have stuff to do I don't have time to find hackers for you Bluehole.2 The game runs alright but often drops down to horrible fps for no apparent reason. (I run a GTX1080 and i7 7700k cpu and I had my fps drop down to 7 during a gunfight for first place. Couldn't aim or even move.3 They are adding microtransactions after explicitly promising not to do this until after Early Access. The excuse is they are ""funding a tournament"" Oh? What happened to the literal 50m+ worth of money you made from sales?4 The game is largely latency based. If someone else is lagging they have an advantage while peaking. They can peak out from a wall shoot you and even if they haven't even appeared yet on your screen you die. You can pump them full of 5 bullets but if on their screen you've already died all the bullets you just hit them with never happened on theirs so they take 0 damage. This basically encourages camping and the game becomes very boring. I've noticed in the 2 months of playing players have slowly become less and less aggressive with people now sitting in buildings for entire games. Can't blame them though the game encourages it with this lousy network coding.5 Too many games end in getting killed by the blue wall due to slightly miscalculating and not being able to outrun it. The blue NEEDS to be outrunnable at all points in the game. I don't care how much damage it does but dying to it has ruined too many awesome moments for me to be okay with it. This is probably my #1 reason for not recommending the game. Dying to the blue is simply not fun. It should be used as a tool to group everyone together not an actual way to die.6 Armour and helmets do absolutely nothing at all. You can get 2 shot KO'd while wearing the best armour in the game. Why did I just spend 20 minutes looking for this gear if it isn't going to protect me? If you want me to spend time looting then MAKE THE ITEMS USEFUL. Multiple times I've been 2 or 3 hit KO'd by an M4 or M16 while at full HP and wearing full level 3 gear. It is very very tilting.7 To add to the reason above attachments do almost nothing. Look up a ""Attachments PUBG Guide"" and you'll see that over half the attachments in the game (which is what you spend the whole game looking for) do almost nothing or literally nothing. Some of them actually make recoil WORSE if you'd believe that. Bluehole you expect us to spend 20 minutes running around looking for items then make the items worthwhile. Right now every game is a waste of time.8 Too many bugs to list. If you've played more than 10 hours of this game you know what it's like to die to a glitch. Vehicles shouldn't be shooting into the sky and jumping out of a car going 2mph shouldn't kill you.",Not Recommended

"I've had a lot of enjoyment out of this game but what appears to be bans to players for some stupid thing like ""stream sniping"" should be a concern for you if you're thinking about making the purchase alongside the microtransaction system they are planning to implement. I'd rather take my refund on the game rather than risking a ban because some sorry streamer can't take a death but doesn't mind being paid for sitting on his behind. Streamers shouldn't feel they're entitled to everything and owed by every developer. How about banning someone that really deserves a ban such as the hackers for a change eh?Once and if they have these problems sorted out I'll consider changing my review.",Not Recommended
"This game is a cool concept but has several huge hurdles to overcome before it's worth the $30 asking price. I'll outline them as best I can. LagThis game is SLOW. Everything but the actual gunplay seems unpolished and awkward. From opening doors to picking up items and even joining a game the input is clunky and unresponsive. This is a huge issue in a fast paced shooter such as PUBG where being able to pick up a pistol after you parachute is the difference between life and death. Expect a half second delay time whenever you press ""f"" to do anything if it even registers that you pressed it at all. Map LoadingTo optimize performance PUBG renders distant objects with less polygons which is a common practice used in games since you're far enough away to not be able to tell the difference anyways. The issue is that in many cases after parachuting down to the ground the high poly models have not loaded yet making every structure ""bloated"" and putting you at a huge disadvantage versus players who have already loaded the models. These low poly models' faces often go OVER loot obfuscating it and forcing you to wander around with your inventory screen up just to tell what's in a particular building. Main MenuThe main menu is a mess. For some reason it takes 40 seconds to load upon startup and after games. I'll admit that they've definitely cut down on menu load time(it used to be much worse) but it's still annoying to have to have an additional minute added to the wait time in between games. The frustration with losing a match can easily be mitigated by hopping right into a new one but this isn't a very streamlined process. If possible I think PUBG ought to work towards putting you in a new match immediately after the death screen but that's probably a long ways away.",Not Recommended
Very sluggish and unoptimized should not be a fully released game yet. It constantly feels like the servers are overloaded. Do not buy this until its been optimized.,Not Recommended

Screw this game or more accurately screw it's creators not only is it bad enough that they still haven't fixed the myriad of issues that plague this betafest of a game with its unpolished optimisations or the rampant cheating then they go and try to sue other publishers who not only did they licence the engine off of but managed to make an objectively better game in the same genre oh and let's not forget there were plenty of Battle Royale games before it so it can pipe the down about anyone stealing ideas (and I don't even like that game) and finally now with this season pass which wouldn't even be worth half of what these are selling it for IN A FULL PRICE GAME.Man I used to like this game screw greedy publishers they are.

Microtransactions while the game is still in early access after saying they wouldn't do that. On top of that instead of using the money towards fixing the game they are using it to fund a tournament.

Yeh no. I really enjoyed this game for a long time but a matchmaking bug meant I could no longer get any games on OCE (my local server). Issue has been around for months and the devs pretty much abandoned OCE to speculation as to why we could no longer get games with limited to no communication. Most of the player base has shifted to other regions but this is just a giant turd sandwich with extra servings of dysnc lag and hackers. Thanks for the memories though looking forward to a competent company bringing out a battle royale in the future.,Not Recommended

This game got me hooked.I started around christmas 2017 and made 400 hours within 3 months. I had tons of fun with my friends and everything was fine.. until.. until nothing happened. Nothing that made the game better. Flaws that you ignore at first because of the hype still there after 400 hours. And there were a lot of flaws. They started to fix them. They started to listen to the community but it was too late. They only started to listen to the Com when players started to quit. Before? Everything was ignored. You had the feeling that they wanted to lure out as much money of the players as possible. They would add Crates and Skins all the time. Crates that you could only open with keys which you had to buy. They would add everything to generate more money. But did they care about other things? Things that people complained about? No. I havent played this game in months and lately they changed a lot of things but they did it because people like me were gone. They were forced to do something to not let the game die. And this is why i refuse to comeback to this game or to support it anywhere in the future. Why i write this review? They added a ing BattlePass now something that isnt worth the money. Something to get even more cash out of the players. This is disgusting and i want to warn you do not buy this game.,Not Recommended

Over a year later and this game is still trash. Feels more like an RPG than an FPS. Weapons are extremely unbalanced bullet drop and recoil is over exaggerated which leads me to believe the developers did no prior research before developing this successful joke. For example the fact that a 7.62 round shoots at the same velocity as a airsoft pellot is beyond me. Want some tips? Go straight for the 9mm SMG's as they seem to be much better all around weapons than anything else in the game or any 5.56 rifle for long range shooting. Makes total sense...Netcode is still complete garbage. No consistency ever. Everything is desynced and I feel like I'm literally playing a third party mod of some game except this game has tons of resources and budget at this point to where there's no excuse for these idiot developers to get off their and actually finish the job. I don't expect them to as Player Unknown is already developing his 2nd game. Way to finish the job before starting something. I guess this is what we have to look forward to in the gaming community Lazy idiotic millenial developers producing a game cashing out and refusing to do anything beneficial for the community that bought in to it.,Not Recommended
Terrible optimization.,Not Recommended
"Pre ""ballistic optimization patch"" Fantastic game has a good future ahead of it. Strongly recommend the purchase they have a plan for the game's future the gameplay is fun if a bit laggy and the tactical realism makes the kill and wins sweeter than any game I've ever played. Post ""ballistic optimization patch"" Game is now ruined. Bullet drop off is majorly changed bullets often don't register due to the new recognition system which is supposed to change damaged based on Head/Limb/Torso hits. Exiting a vehicle is instant teleport there's no animation so in combat you have no idea if that's what they're doing until it's too late to reposition. Unless they majorly change this supposed ""ballistic optimization"" this game is not a recommendation from me. Edit Some people are arguing that the new ballistics are in the test servers. Yes they are but they're being deployed to all servers in a mere 6 hours (at the time of writing) and PUBG Corp/Bluehole is turning a blind eye to the garbage the new system is despite being told by players top professional players (Dr. Disrespect Shroud etc.) Bluehole needs to get their crap together or this game is dying mid to late 2018.Some people have told me the devs are working on a fix. I'm going to tell you exactly what this game needs to be fixed 1. Clothes as loot Gone. Make clothes static as part of the buildings not something that gets in the way of getting guns.2. Guarantee some form of weaponry in every building Pans Machetes pistols AR Grenades etc. GUARANTEE. This will make looting a more enjoyable experience as the extensive ""10 minute loot for a 1 second death"" will be virtually gone. 3. Remove shotguns their no aim Instant kill nature ruins the early game4. Increase server reliability. This is a no brainer.5. Add map selection to remove the unenjoyably matches for those who dislike a particular map.",Not Recommended

It's a good battle royale game honestly and it's fun to play with friends.However I'm giving it a negative review because of it's item shop policy where you spend your earned points on a crate and there is a RANDOM chance you will get a crate that you have to PURCHASE a key to open. I have useless crates sitting in my inventory now taking up space and infuriating me whenever I look at them.Just make keyed crates and non locked crates separate purchase categories. I don't see much point in progressing and earning battle points if it is random that I will not be able to spend it on things to use in game.,Not Recommended

It is terribly optimised with big frame drops chinese player do not have servers in china so they play NA and AS servers with lots of lag.

First person mode which eliminate the disadvantages of 3 person mode but is imperfect and it shows laziness of the creators. Huge amount of crashed games. Devs deploys patches each month but it ruined and couse more damage then it improve.. Huge amount of bugs and errors(you cant heal yourself etc) The game is too random you often land on the building with 10 opponents next to each other and despite the search of the whole building you do not even find a weapon. Delay in the appearance of items you often lend and thare is nothing on the ground but after a while items apears. Poor optimization On a PC for 1500$ i get average 60fps on minimal senting what is unacceptable but despite average 60 fps game fps drops so bad that turn the game into a slideshow.

The game runs very poorly even on a mid tier PC the system requirements are also incorrect because even having parts better than that the game runs terrible on all very low settings. Also the networking for the game is pretty bad too it is extremely frustrating to being shooting at someone rubberbanding all over the place.Edit The developers have added microtransactions which they promised wouldn't be in the game until it was finished and released fully. It's flabbergasting to see that even when a dev team makes millions more they are still greedy for more money and releasing microtransactions instead of actually finishing their broken game.,Not Recommended

This is a great game dont get me wrong. be twhen you get 50 hours of gameplay then run into a bug that restrains you from playing the game that you payed 30$ for its just not worth it. a few months go by and a update comes out saying it will specifically fix that bug yet you still have the same problem and cant play the game. this game has a lot of potential but it shouldnt be a game it yet its just not ready it has way to many bugs that restrain players from playing the game that they payed for.,Not Recommended

"Every game is crawling with hackers and exploiters and what does the dev do? ""Added emoted and new skins lol xD"" because people are starting to realize that there are other Battleroyale games that actually give a damn about the playerbase instead of trying to milk every cent they can out of people and allowing hackers to roam free. They don't issue IP bans they don't investigate these people who suddenly in their first handful of hours make it to the top of the leaderboards (boy howdy wonder how those got there so fast) and they don't investigate these ridiculous cross map headshots and kills despite the blatant use of cheats to get them. Instead they adjust for e sports purposes only and they add emotes because ""well that other game over there did it and people like it better."" You want to sue people for using a concept that has been around since before he majority of your dev team was even born but then you want to copy things they've had since launch? Make up your minds get your asses in gear to permanently ban cheaters (not an account ban because we all know how incredibly easy it is to make a new Steam account) and instead of having your artists devote time into making new skins have them work on the awful texture flickering found on buildings and the fps drops from particle effects.",Not Recommended

Region Lock China (Check) You also did an update that promised to block cheat system but.... it just ed up my fps!! I'm still finding three ou four cheaters and I'm having too much frame drop! I can't understand how you can't deal with macro and tracking cheat! It's so easy! Just do like valve in CSGO ten years ago! In this way cheaters will drop in 90%! You have to really pay atention in cheaters situation but not like you did until now. Otherwise this game will die if a big company put in the market a new battle royale game! Edit Great! You'll removed anti cheat system to recover those fps lost in last update but now there are TOO MANY CHEATERS!! IN EVERY SINGLE PLAY I FOUND AT LEAST 5 MACRO USERS! You can listen weapons in single shot shooting as automatic with no recoil!! I don't want play this game any more while a real anti cheat system isn't aplied.,Not Recommended

"Okay to start off I don't have a gaming PC that can possibly run this game. But still I insisted myself and bought this game although I knew that it was impossible for me to play at home. I knew for a start that there was an internet cafe at the city and that was my only source of playing this game. I went there after school during weekend in order to play with my friends even though the internet cafe was costly. I have spent around 50 hours playing this game (played more on my friend's accounts) and I enjoyed every moments of it.However about a month ago I was banned for no reason whatsoever. I know a month ago right? I still decided to write this as a review anyways. As I have said before I only play this game at an internet cafe and so do many other people that visit the internet cafe. I can see for a fact that hundreds of people visit the internet cafe as it is the only one of two popular internet cafes in the city. But what? I am banned? It was pretty shocking when I first saw it. NO ONE else knew my account details and I was the only person that played on my account and obviously playing at the internet cafe I never hacked. I tried to be calm and emailed Bluehole about my situation and what? They can't revert my account. Supposedly softwares running in the background that ""MIGHT"" be a hack was detected during my gameplay and I was banned. I don't know if this happens to anyone else but wasting 30 dollars + all the money I spent going to internet cafe was it really worth? Do they even actually go through my gameplays and see any signs of hack before banning? Do they actually take their time to look deeper into this situation? I don't really think so.",Not Recommended

"Not really sure why this game is so popular. Game mechanics aren't very tight and quickly grew stale for me. Shooting physics don't feel very accurate driving is meh/buggy melee combat is so laggy it's laughable. I get kicked randomly from matchmaking all the time and the game itself seems full of bugs and random glitches. Feels unfinished.Also don't really feel safe or welcome playing this game. The developers ban anyone who kills or annoys their streamer royalty. If you make the mistake of killing the wrong player too many times banned. If you honk a car horn and it happens to be in the vicinity of someone who's choosing to broadcast the gameplay for profit Banned. If you join the same lobby too many times (possibly due to the janky connections) and kill a streamer banned. If I was aware the developers were going to treat their customers this way I would not have purchased the game. I feel they should definitely have to disclose the preferential treatment players can receive in exchange for advertising the game through streaming gameplay. That doesn t seem very fair to the rest of us who just want to play the game and have fun.PUBG developers have basically created a small group of privileged players who have the authority to restrict your enjoyment and playtime either through direct complaints resulting in bans or the constant looming threat of ""is this guy I'm about to shoot a streamer?"". This practise of elevating streamers above the common player base creates a hostile and unbalanced game environment with essentially 2 classes of players tantamount to paid and free populations now it s just Streamers and Non streamers. And with the constant updates there seems to be new ways every week for unaware plebeian players to step wrong and cross the steam lords of PUBG. To top it off if you complain or try to voice your objections to the ban you run the risk of the developers publicly humiliating you on their twitter. They have done so to several players already.I honestly cannot believe Steam allows this kind of developer behaviour.. Seems very dishonest and unfair to me. Combine that with a shooting game that s just not really that fun for me and I can t seem myself playing PUBG again.",Not Recommended

BoringPick up trash and get shot simulator 2017,Not Recommended
Gameplay is interesting enough. For an EA game it runs decent enough although there are some pretty gamebreaking issues (vehicle mechanics buggy hitboxes complete trash foilage settings).I would give it a 6 or 7 out of 10 for an EA game if the community and the devs weren't such garbage. The devs bend over backwards to please a couple whiny streamers. As it stands you can get banned for honking your horn at a person you had no idea was streaming. Meanwhile people in the lobby are screaming racial slurs at you constantly but apparently honking your horn is a bigger problem than that.Stream sniping shouldn't be a bannable offense. Simply set a delay like ANY OTHER GAME THAT HAS EVER BEEN STREAMED.Friendly fire shouldn't be a bannable offense. If your teammate is trash in a game of this nature you should be able to waste that guy.Stream HONKING being bannable is the most ludicrious thing I have ever heard. The difference between PC gamers and console gamers is PC gamers by definition tend to work 40 hours a week so we can afford to build nice rigs and play games how we would like to play them. The devs of this game don't seem to care about that and instead favor the opinions of whiny rich kids who can afford to play video games 10 hours a day. The strength of the PC gaming community has always been our ability and willingness to completely screw over devs that screw over us. So in that spirit SCREW OVER THIS GAME UNTIL THEY START LISTENING TO US. Blast the negative reviews tell everyone not to buy this game. Until they learn where their bread and butter is (the MILLIONS of hardworking ordinary people that bought th is game) they don't deserve your support.,Not Recommended
I used to love this game I really liked watching streamers play it and all the sudden stream snipers who did nothing but honk vehicles got banned? Like seriously devs? Seriously? Is this some sort of a cruel and sick joke? Uhh here we go again... If you devs see this You should stop wanking off to the streamers and actually think about the community instead of the streamers. And I don't understand how it's bannable? Like if a streamer streams a game it is their responsibility whether someone watches their screen and tracks every movement of theirs etc. Like seriously this game is better constructed than H1Z1 but when it comes to the devs individually they suck.,Not Recommended
This game could have been great but it is the so bad now.

"Very bad game! I never leave negative reviews for games but if you are debating buying this game and you read this review heed my warning. This game should free to play! It feels like a singleplayer game that added a multiplayer expansion and that single player game was terrible to being with. In short this game is like AIDS you don't want it but your friends make you get it anyway.The concept for the game is trash when combined with the large map spread out players atrocious graphics and player movement. Getting kills is not fun as is dying. Most of the game is spent walking or traveling another majority is spent picking up items aka ""looting"". Your death is imminent. There is only one type of game the max team is 4 people. This game is wasted potential and that is what makes this so hard to hate. But it is so bad you will hate it anyway.",Not Recommended

"It wasn't really fun to begin with but the amount of kills that occur due to lag (emptying an entire magazine into someone 5 feet away will not kill that person but god forbid he throws a punch at you) possible cheats (someone shooting at you though spectating him shows that there was little to no reason for him to check that nook) blatent cheating (just instadowning you from across the map) make this ""game"" not worth your time at all. Also the devs decided to add insult to injury by adding a loading screen 6 months after ""release"" which and I am not exaggerating shows humanlike mannequins which appear to have been rendered in 2003 for the game ""little big adventure"".How is it that a game which has amassed money AAA publishers can only dream of can not even afford more than two (!) badly rendered not even screen filling loading screens? At this rate I'd assume that future updates will include a loading bar which does not progress past 17% or maybe a new plane that flies upside down into a hillside while teleporting you to your destination.",Not Recommended

I loved this game absolutely loved it. I played it for over 300h and then I decided to take a pause. Returned for a few matches in the 1.0 version and it was still quite okay. Yesterday I tried to play it the menu screen was filled with cases and key ads. When I finally got into a match it took ages for everything to load in (something that had never been a problem before). And now they are trying to sue a company which happens to be their only real competition. I don't know why they're doing it but they are and that is extremely of them. I hope that they lose but since the court is in Korea it is going to be handled a bit differently and that might mean that Bluehole actually win.Frankly I can't believe that they aren't continuing the development of the game and instead investing the time into micro transactions and loot boxes so frankly bluehole.,Not Recommended
sad,Not Recommended
Overall after 700+ hours played I had a lot of fun the game is enjoyable and very rewarding when you win. However the amount of users/cheaters in general has increased hugely. When I first started playing when it came out the cheaters were pretty uncommon now consistantly getting into the top 10 my teammates and I usually get insta wiped by an user that locks on without even seeing us and drops us before we can even blink. Would not reccommend this game as it's all about the cheating to win now. Region lock China that would be a huge plus. Crates require keys now to open with a $2.50 purchase and give trash constantly crate loot ratios are trash. TL DR Don't buy this game it's gone down the and not worth it anymore unless China is region locked.,Not Recommended

I bought this game nearly at the start so now i can speak about it properly. When i first time laucnhed this game i was shocked how good it was as idea and how bad as game. First five month it was really interesting game and when i had 40 fps on minimum settings i really liked gameplay. Later game became more optimized and game increased fps to 60 as average but here's one disappointment. Game started crashing right in the game. I don't see any solution for my problem but fact is that this game is became unoptimised DayZ standalone n2. Thanks for the new skins probably I can enjoy them in the menu.,Not Recommended

"To give you a basic idea of the game You and another 99 players jump out of a plane into a huge inhabited map (there a diffierent maps) you have only your clothes and a simple bag that is empty. Once you hit the ground you have to acquire guns ammo and equipment that is scattered through the map. You have to search for them into abandoned buildings and houses. Once you are packed you can try to find another players and kill them or you can hide and wait. As time passes a zone in the map is marked players must get there in a given time otherwise their health start to drop until they die. As the number of players is reduced the game zone is reduced as well. Finally you end up fighting in a small area until only 1 player remains alive.My review (It's my humble opinion after playing it for about 2 days and ending TOP20 on almost 70% of the games) It is a nice game based on a great idea but not a big deal in the end. In fact it becomes really boring after 10 hours of gameplay. Further work and contents must be applied to make it more interesting to actual players and possible new players.I just bought it because the game's loot gives you the chance to turn it into cash to be able to buy stuff for other games. I think this would be cool until the market prices get too low to be able to buy any other stuff.

I have played PubG for a little while now and I left my review until 1.0 because well... I thought it would be fair to judge the game based on the so called final product.

SO MANY BUGSCan't shoot through chain link fencesSome objects/fences only allow bullets to go one wayPunching is really unrealistic and makes the start of matches really dumbThird person is rubbish the only way to get an even play field is playing first personPeople use leaning to their advantage even though it's unrealistic and looks stupidLoot is far too inconsistentThe gun play is unpredictable (that bullet might go where you're aiming or it might to 4 meters to the right!

"I like the game played it since EA release on steam. It was fun you could do everything. The first comment i received from a friend when the ""horn"" update was made was ""lets honk other people to death"". I didnt get a chance to do that yet. Lucky me because if it wouldve been the wrong person I could have been banned for that even tho i rarely do visit twitch. When you try to punish streamsniping it becomes impossible to have proof beyond reasonable doubt. There are several reasons to search for a new lobby never had a friend who missed his jump? Afk? Disconnect? Honking isnt the only thing to get banned people streaming and shooting in the open for 10sec and then being shot... oh such surprise mustve been a streamsniper. GJ. Could have been everybody though the fact that you can proof that it was actually the person you honked at doesnt mean you sniped him cause if I see somebody well how do you know that I watched that stream and didnt fool around? Yeah now already around 90 people of my friends actrually do own the game. I will tell the rest to stay away from it until devs release that when you priorize a certain group out of your customers you will only cause problems. In the end we are all customers. So in the end we all start streaming... 100 people each time I get killed damn it was a sniper ! So immediately ban pls I mean you can fake all kinds of viewers on your stream so yeah it is utterly stupid and wrong to ban people for that. Is it legit you get banned when I run around ingame and use voice and complain afterwards that you heard me yelling? Damn get some god damn sense devs.",Not Recommended

This garbage is the most overrated game of 2017/2018 Except for the first person view and the immersion it may offers pretty much everything else sucks bad netcode bad servers ( roll backs at the start of round ) horrible optimization ( for a not so good looking game at the end ... ).Gameplay wise it gets old quickly ( the last safezones are usually 95% flat plains if you're not at the center of the area or if you don't have a x8 scope you are already dead ... ) if you dont spawn at the key locations you're probably have some boring time before having action the vehicles are glitchy some weapons feel weird especially with the recoil random pattern i dont even know whats the point of melee weapons in this game ( you have like a 0.5 second lag between the moment you press the click and when your guy actually swings his melee weapon the delay between 2 swings is really high ) And now it is on 1.0 another rushed out early access for milking peopleJust take Fortnite it's free better on every point ( excluding the missing first person view ) more stable and the construction system actually provides a little amount of skill at the end of the match unlike PUBG where you have 0 ways to defend yourself against the average silenced KAR wielding morron on his hill that spent nearly his whole match waiting either up a staircase or in a bush.,Not Recommended

If you are here for the Steam sale a word of caution. This game is a good game it has many problems with bugs terrible netcode and it is very poorly optimized. This game is on its way out but it will be a good few months before it dies in the U.S. at least and probably longer for its international audience. The developers have had a year + to fix many performance issues and cannot seem to grasp the fact that clunky and inconsistent gameplay for this type of genre is infuriating. Try playing for 30+ minutes and then being killed by poor netcode lag and the occasional cheater. It simply isn't fun at that point.,Not Recommended

Now i really wish steam had mixed review because im on a verge with this game.Game is really fun to play with friends it has lot of potential and gameplay design is good.Problems with this game lay in crappy performance and bugs. Textures/mesh grid not loading at same speed for everyone at start of the game good luck picking up a gun or fighting when you are bobling on buildings up and down with 8bit textures randomly falling through terrain getting stuck inside of walls fences furniture. Lag and desync is horrible get used to getting shot after you have taken cover rubber bending all over the place picking up weapon just to realize 3 seconds later it went magically back on the floor. Before someone says its my internet connection i play on 120mbps connection on my region servers.Besides poor network optimization game itself is badly optimized with fps drops stuttering and freezes i play it on very low even tho my hardware should play it comfortably on med high. Its ridiculous to have to put game on very low and play on 720p resolution while it still looks like crap just to be able to have somewhat stable 40 50fps. I watched streamers such as shroud experience same types of stutters and freezes so its really not something on our end its their badly optimized code.Then there is whole another issue of buggy vehicles fences/walls windows. There also seems to be surge of hackers lately.All in all i cant in good faith recommend this game in its current condition especially considering 30 euros price tag in its current state its worth max 10 euros or so.,Not Recommended

Pretty blocked on each element of the map. have enough time to make a coffee when i hit the prone key.

Through out the time whilst i was playing this game I was never truly satisfied with the game itself. Something major was missing and it didn't feel satisfying as a game. Generally I enjoy most shooters but I ofcourse had substantially negative perception of what kind of game this is since the genre of this game is very unfamiliar to me and seems very weak for the long term for customer consumption since it lacks variety in gameplay. But still when I first launched the game I decided to enter the game without any prejudice towards it since the reviewes were amazing and playerbase was rising daily. So when I give this review you have to realise that I was never truly a fan of this game genre so realistically speaking I probably shouldn't have ever bought the game in the first place regardless of the hype this game gets on the daily.Major flaw that affected my opinion of this game was the unpleasant feeling of time being wasted each time I die after spending approximately 10 minutes of my time just looting. The whole tidious process of looting is one of the worst things I've yet to experience in a game add to that the whole slow pace aspect of the game and thats the finishing blow for me. Only gratifying feeling in this game is when you are in the top 10 and you face off the very last opponents you have to kill but that's about it. Everything else about this game is pretty damn broken.Should you buy this game? Yes you should if you enjoy the genre for what it's worth the genre was from the get go not for me.The game aswell is in alpha but its been there for quite some time and good updates were released just to bring up some examples the optimization update did a great job as someone who uses 144hz it was prior to the update unpleasant to play with random fps drops which are mostly fixed. Devs are working and I hope the game will see different game modes different maps that are much smaller so the action is a lot more quick paced since this game has different type of players with different type of playstyles.,Not Recommended

This game can be fun and it is. Though when you have people connecting from over in the Eu to NA server makes it total garbage. The server's seem to not be able to handle a lot of people on lots of rubberbanding and I know its not me having this on a ssd seems to make little or no difference and my internet is just fine 220.96Mbps and 12.25Mbps.when playing seeing people jump from one location to another is not a good thing and getting killed when you put an entire clip into someone and they don't die but turn around and shoot you once and your dead. I do and I don't reccomend this game until they either get better server's or make it to where you are not able to connect unless it is in your own region.My pc spec's are Windows 10 Home 64 bitAMD Ryzen 7 170016.0GB Dual ChannelBIOSTAR Group X370GT7 (AM4)RX 480 8192MB223GB OCZ ARC100 (SSD)931GB Seagate ST31000528AS (SATA223GB FUJITSU M200 240GB (SSD),Not Recommended

i used to like pubg but as time went on i realised that they weren't listening to fans and were just added pointless content like a new map (mirimar) that wasn't even fun and was full of gliches to be honest the entire game is full of glitches that will make your experiece less enjoyable and that is really unexepltible since the game costs 30 dollars. now we have the latest tragedy which is sanhook and the event pass sanhook as a map is not that bad but the event pass is just awful first of all it costs 10 dollars to use the event pass which is weird because the game already costs money to play the pass only lasts 30 days and it would take 29 days and to reach those 29 days you would have to play pubg 6 to 8 hours a day which is insane and then when you get an item you can only keep it for 20 days because how dare you for grinding on our 10 dollar event pass and expect to keep what you have no screw you you can only get those items PERMENENTLY through the use of gambling through are terrible lootbox system. they clearly didn't see what their competitor's battle pass did so much better because the event pass does not reward you for grinding it just slaps you in the face for wasting 10 dollars and the tiem you could have been playing a better game. then we have the problem with the hackers and the cheaters which i think by this point they have given up on. but you might be thinking well they did arrest those 2 cheaters in china well my friends that was clearly just a way to set and example for the rest of the cheaters but it didn't work and cheating and hacking is still a giant problem. but again as i mentioned they will never listen to their fan base and just add a new scope that nobody asked for. while their competitor manges to find a balence between adding new content fixing the exsisting content. in conclusion i think pubg is do poorly right now but it can be fixed if they would jsut listen to their community for once and jsut stop adding new content when ever the fans get mad.,Not Recommended

The game used to be fun but I got tired of saying 'They'll fix it eventually' The game had alot of promise back when it first released. It was a clunky mess of unoptimised poop but it got better. With each update came optimisation and tweeks to gameplay. However PUBG lost its charm when updates became more about tweeking it for Esports that made it unplayable and laughably bad. There's no reward for winning and no runner up prize if you come 2nd after a 30 minute game. Just a few hundren points to spend on some cosmetic loot boxes that give you the same pair of shoes over and over. Servers are trash netcode is none exsistant and hackers are everywhere. It's so bad that now after months of being out of early access released on Xbox One AND has a esports they're like 'ok we'll fix the game'If this were at the beginning I'd say buy it. Give it a chance because it is early access but it seems like its going places. But now it's a poor excuse for a game that hardly functions through its terrible gunplay and movement.,Not Recommended

Let it be known that when you play this game you must expect to lose.In combat so in combat there is a 1 second delay between you and the server.You will be aiming and shooting a guy before he sees you and in theory he should be dead but with the 1 second delay he will turn around later like 1 second after you shoot him and he will kill you.So until the servers are fixed which must be hard since its 100 players a lobby then I will give this a good review.You can't make a shooter multiplayer game and have so much lag.Have less servers and buy better quality servers I will wait longer for a more fair match.But PUBG is the most played game so they sold the most copies and they should have the best servers.You can blame that on Greedyness.SCORE 6/10I do not recommend this game until the servers are 99% accurate with shot registration.,Not Recommended

Playerunknown's Battlegrounds is a good game in general. I bought the game and played some matches with good confidence and excitement. I want to like the game but it's going downhill right now.When I first started playing the game it was fine and bugs existed but the developers had promises with bug fixes and general issues. Personally I think the game needs a big bug fix and optimization because running this on a potato pc makes you feel tricked by paying 29.99 on a game that performs poorly with 20 fps.I'm still waiting for Bluehole to finally get things going and make some good changes such as bug fixes and fps optimization as I metioned. But the thing is that instead of using all of this huge amount of money that they've earned they are jumping on Fortnite and trying to sue them. This makes the game bad because of how the developers are focusing on rivalry instead of making the game better. Each week I play less and less because i'm really starting to give up my hopes of this game.,Not Recommended

"Game Content Great. For a battle royale one of the best. The addition of the team deathmatch gamemode was also nice. Helped spice up the game add some variety. Gun physics somewhat accurate difficult to master quickly. Overall a very good concept Game Performance Getting Better. For a game that started where it started it's definitely improved tenfold over the beta/early access/whatever version of the game. However a concern all players have is definitely how slow they are to keep optimizing the game. The time spent to develop emotes extra crates and the goddamn ing Sanhok fortnite ripoff money grab event is completely useless. Not to mention trying to take everything from Fortnite that is different from PUBG because Fortnite is ""more popular"". Not to mention trying to sue Epic Games in the meantime for copying. Brendan Greene you didn't invent battle royale buddy. Not to defend fortnite but it's a totally different game just the same genre. If Valve tried to sue Activision just because CS GO is similar to COD it'd be pretty stupid. So stop spending all your time trying to regain your players and trying to rip them off for money + making a useless lawsuit and give your players what they want an optimized game. Customer Support Absolute ing Garbage. Contact PUBG Corp about a problem you have and they send an automated reply saying the same thing Whatever the you have an issue with we cannot change it because of the way that it is. Okay so I might've teamkilled a few of my squad members as jokes and we 'report' each other sometimes as a joke or because it was deserved. Either way it got me banned. Now mind you I didn't think it was a big deal you could contact support and get your account unbanned with the logical and reasonable explanation. Nope. PUBG Corp s you in the Vigorously. Sorry Player your account has had an infraction on it we cannot remove it because it's been applied. We hope this helped ) Enjoy your PUBGless life. Well that was a waste of how many hours and $37 CAD. So as a retard I tried to give it another try. After many times trying to contact support I was kindly gifted the game again on a separate account. (Which I still have to pay back my deepest apologies Monty.) Fast forward to one hour into the game. BANNED. Again. No reason just an almost instant ban. Now a waste of 2 peoples money. Again after multiple attempts of contacting PUBG Support the same automated response Sorry player we can't do this as you're banned. In terms of helping customers by far the worst support team out there. UPDATE recently there was a notice about PUBG giving compensation to accidentally banned players. Hearing about this I reinstalled the game to check if I was part of that list. Nope. Another ticket to PUBG. Another ing degenerate response. ""This only applies to people who were accidentally banned. We noticed you've been banned so this does not apply to you."" Thanks ) makes 100% sense and helped us waste $74 CAD. I would recommend this game however the way they disregard players and their concerns makes me change my mind.",Not Recommended

"PlayerUnknownBattleGrounds or PUBG was a great game when I began playing. Now unless I'm playing with friends or just bored out of my mind picking up PUBG is unthinkable. I understand that the game is an ""early access"" game and the team behind this game started out extremely small and is doing what they can. But when the devs start breaking promises and implementing cosmetics that the community decided to be pricey (a damn skirt for an online game is over $100) instead of fixing the countless bugs for this game then I say it is safe to say that the headache that this game causes is not worth the current price of $30.Now if a friend is telling you to purchase this game so you can play with him/her just know what you are getting yourself into. That 30 minutes of looting or driving/walking into the circle can be ruined by one simple bug or camper and when in squads a looting run gets you around 20 50 points with no kills. You wont even be able to enjoy the tasteless cosmetics this game has to offer. However I've had plently of good experiences despite what i've written with this game. Those only came when I was with a group of friends not having a care in the world. So if you want a game to play with your friends buy something else if they already own this game then why the hell not get rid of the headache you get from them nagging you to get this game and get a new type of headache that being once induced from PUBG.",Not Recommended

I am not going to give AN opinion on how the game could be like but rather focus on what I EXPERIENCED while playing the version of the game as it is now.Pros Nice weapon mechanics Beautiful and well designed map Interesting game design Environmental sound is terrific Nice character customization Richness of items and weapons Cons Player movements feels clunchy. You can't jump through a lot of small fences and rocks Netcode is terrible. I go further to say that it is even worse than in Battlefield 4 in its earlier days. Actually Battlenonsense ranked this game's netcode as one of the worse out there. Check out his video on Youtube Extremely bad optimized with massive FPS drops (and I have two Titan X and up to level hardware) You might point out that I only had 3 cons for this game but for me they are the pillars of a good game specially the netcode and the OBVIOUS bugs. I don't want to be killed because I shot someone in the face and the server didn't register it or when you try to retreat or/and get cover and the game glitches. Specially for this kind of game where death is a big punishment.If you are coming from even worse bugs and netcode issues such as DayZ and H1Z1 you might find this game interesting or if you are extremely minimalist and do not care for these obvious phenomenons that ARE going to affect your game experience you might find this game interesting.Finally I can only conclude that this game was a bit overhyped. Since it is the best of its kind so far we don't really have much to compare with leading to this massive hype.NOTE You can refund this game if you are not satisfied with the experience. Check your purchases log to call it back. You must have played until X hours in order to do so. I believe it must be just a few probably less than 4 like I did.,Not Recommended
"Before anything let me just say that the game is really fun. It really is. But fun / a purchase. The game is buggy. Very buggy. Optimization is horrible and seeing how the developers are ""fixing"" it I don't believe it will improve much. The price is ridiculous. 30$ is WAY more than what this game is offering. Desync and other annoyences are all over the place. You shoot a guy point blank with a shotgun blood comes out everywhere he doesn't die and he 1 shots you with a pistol. Happens way too often. Do not let the screenshots above make you think that this game is beautiful its not. The game is unplayable with everything on ultra EVEN if you have an overkill PC like me. Not to mention that having shadows on super low actually gives you an advantage because you can see players from far away and inside buildings. Also turning foilage super low allows you to see people hiding in bushes. You are banned from discussing cheaters (not cheats) in the forums. (Someone can't take criticism) You wont be able to run the game at a consistant 60 FPS. You just wont. Some places are 10 fps others are 90 but most of the time (if you have a high end PC) you will get 40 50 fps averege. But with all that being said the game is fun. I like running around fighting the other players and trying to be the best and survive. Playing with friends is even funner. But after all of what I covered this will have to be a negative review. I like this game but I wouldn't recommend it AT THE MOMENT. I will update this review if they fix the game.Too bad you can't ban people for posting reviews huh Bluehole?EDIT Yeah the optimization got better.

"do not buy this game it is trash.this game is attempting to be the next big hotness in competitive shooters and yet it has beyond doubt the worst shooting mechanics of any game i have ever played. i guess the programmers missed the memo. imagine the clunky ""realness"" of arma but with zero polish. never get close to any object if you want to shoot virtually everything in the game has ghost edges that will absorb your bullets and there is no penetration.the game will prevent you from pulling your gun up to shoot if you are too close but unlike arma and some other games even if you are in iron sights will simply drop the gun to low ready rather than just preventing you from getting any closer. so if you need to hold tight angles and shoot back at the enemy too bad.there are massive issues with the perspective you see your crosshairs and the actual angle of your aim. part of this is due to the default third person mode but even in first person there is a different point of aim between normal movement and aiming down sights. this will result in shots striking objects you dont expect in close range engagements because your crosshairs are not represenative of your actual field of fire.the net code is horrifying. all multiplayer games have lag. some are worse than others. some are amazingly well done. i have never seen a game with sync issues like this. it is most noticable if you are dead and spectating a squad member and they aim down sights at an enemy and begin to track and shoot them. you will see them aiming a significant angle off of target its not that they cant aim they are aiming and hitting the target but hat the desync is just that severe. and it is impossible to tell just how much it affects the rest of the game apart from trying to open doors or get in and out of vehicles.the vehicles are arma2 level of bad. small bumps or variations in terrain will launch you sideways through the air. dont hit a bridge at full speed on a bike because you might sink into it before the games fourth rate net code syncs up resulting in you impacting the bridge poping out of the bridge and cartwheeling through the air. taking damage at best and likely losing the bike and getting killed at worstso you have a ""competitive shooter."" hoping to be the next big esport. it has pathetically bad shooting mechanics it has the worst net code ive ever seen and its vehicles behave as though they are on the moon.i get that this is an early access game. i am aware of the issues with early access i own many early access titles. but these are not issues that they should be having even in early access. to put this in perspective. DayZ standalone is a more mechanically functional and sound competitive shooter with regards to the shooting netcode and vehicles. than this game is by leaps and bounds. and we probably all know what a show dayz is.and their announced plans for mtx are pure cancer but really that is a foot note given the massive mechanical failings of the game.",Not Recommended

"Nice idea bad performance.The game itself is fun laggy servers bad fps and random dcs are not.+ Nice gameidea similar to arma 3 Battle Royale+ Good loot spawns everybody can get a gun pretty fast+ Good looking map Sounds are a bit confusing random ""shell hitting ground"" sound sometimes my own footsteps are played from a different location. no killcam (would be nice to see what you did wrong/where the enemy was shooting from) laggy servers random dcs (it's not only at ""rushhours"" I still got laggy servers 5pm.

"Too broken.Devs release a survey ""What should we do to improve the desert map"" and closed it before I could respond so here's the response.Finish it?

Mircotransactions. Couldn't help myself gave me 3 trash items for $7.50 and all my BP. Wondered what the circle icon on the bottom was Clicked on it but thanks to their trash network today nothing happened for a full 2 seconds so i clicked again and since I double clicked the warning came and went and refunded my $2.50 1200 BP item for 120BP. Ridiculous. I'm such a sucker for microtransactions like these and it's a poor practice for game developers. I'm all for new items but make it in game currency please. I'm a completionist. I want all the cosmetic items I can get but the fact that there are premium limited run items behind a pay wall really is a awful thing to do.,Not Recommended
This is good game Some toxicity Couple of bugs Good gameplay Active devs? Much Potential Chinese and Koreans on NA servers? People that will accuse you of ''Stream Sniper'' Need to have patience and strategy to win. No rank ( If any devs a reading this please dont put ranked games in that will attract a hella lot of wannabee part of championship and toxic people that will ruin the overall ''good'' gameplay experience) Devs put microtransaction when they said they wouldnt When they told us that they wont be anything like that They had my praises for not being moneygrabbing ******* but now look even tho this game is early access and cost at least 30$ CAD and that the player base is now huge they got back on theyre word and they put microtransactions plus theyre banning tons of people for no ''REAL REASON'' .

The game has gone from action packed fast paced gameplay to 60 people alive in the 3th circle because every single squad has taken every single building in that circle. The game is full of people who wanna become one with a bush one with a stone one with a house one with every single fckin object you can imagine.I most certainly enjoy spending 10 minutes of my life looting a place being happy about all the things I found and then ending up dying to a bushman or one of the 50.000.000 people that camp the door of a house.,Not Recommended

My friends and I bought this thinking it would be fun but after 2 weeks all we do is argue because we cannot work as a team and 1 person inevitably gets blamed for dying too soon while another gets killed by some rando because the hitmarkers do not show where your being shot from. Also $30 for a free for all sandbox killgame with 1 map and 1 game mode is bs. I know the hype is real but wait for a full release and pay full price if it's good then 5/7.,Not Recommended
Hackers have ruined this game. Cheaters in almost every game not even hiding it. Played 5 games the other night and got killed by 3 obvious cheaters. Cheaters with names like CheatBoy999 who I looked up on pubgtracker and had a 100 1 kd ratio and a 90% win rate with all headshots. If the game cannot detect a player shooting full auto at over 1000 meters with a UMP and killing 40 50 players per game you got real problems. These cheaters get 50 200 games in before they are detected and they are openly speed hacking or aimbotting. I really enjoyed the game for the first 400+ games I managed to win about 130 games. I haven t won in the last few weeks because every single game has a hacker in it. The game is ruined do not buy it unless they do something to address cheating.,Not Recommended
The combat system is horrible. 1 on 1 encounters seem to be always be decided by who spots each other first with the lower ping and not by reaction or aiming skills. The hit reg and hitbox are stupid and feel incomplete.thanks to that the game feels only skill dependant on your patience to sneak like a retard and communicate with your premade ape friends as combat is inconsistant. the game's design promotes heavy camping because of RNG circles n shheeeeiittt and that's how almost every person in the top 10 gets gets there and gets kills.and its even worse in thirdperson since now you can legit camp behind a door looking at someone incoming without giving them any chance to know you can see them completely unfair because in shooters if the enemy can see you you should be able to see them too even if its a single pixel or zoom in is needed. RNG if not already a deciding factor in your early game mid game and late game via drops plane drops stupid war zones and circles can take the fun out of the game if you are at the other side of the map away from the circle zone if you can't find any vehicle you are either doomed rushing to find one right when the circle spawns or hold shift for 7 minutes.thus the RNG promotes you to usually land around the center of the map or in large cities which in turn you are encouraged to land with a large bunch of other flying feces and rush to find equipment first and kill them like an afghanistan child. the visual information feedback is terrible you have no idea how much damage you can do to a target if the target is wearing a vest under certain clothes what weapon the enemy is holding(unless you're point blank) and even if you hit someone target AT ALL unless you are close enough to see some blood sprays. The game itself takes zero effort to teach you what the is going on and how the core mechanics work such as if your weapons are hitscan or projectiles with travel speed your weapon's damage how certain consumables such as grenades and boosts work from what distance can people hear you running/crawling.it took people to playtest for hours (ON LIVE SERVERS because you can't create a custom) to find a weapon's damage recoil spread reload time weapon upgrade benefits hitzone calculation hitbox bullet travel and drop etc. Parachute control walking running and jumping movement is awkward. You can't even check your ing ping or change your nickname.4/10 great potentional bad execution Do not recommend it's only fun with friends.,Not Recommended

"Hello People Here is an updated review to PUBG my last was very positive.Developers and the game It has changed a lot with the time the developers brought out many useless updates and made a lot of money with the game we got nearly nothing!PUBG is now one of the most selled games ever in his time range and it feels like the developers are just interrested in the costumers money so we never got free stuff or funny events we should get because WE ARE THE COMMUNITY we make the game great because we are the ones who keeps it alive. For example we nearly never got an performance update or something.Players/ PlaystyleThen there is a big problem (in my opinion). I speak about the direction how the players plays they just camp in buildings or at the deathly border. This takes away the action parts of the game there are no fair and fun gun fights WHO CAMPS WINS. The only action u get is in the TOP 10 FIGHT.Positive/ Negative things pointedNEGATIVE moneygreedy developers still bad performance (getting better slowly) mad/ terrible players support isn't interested in your problems (I got banned for something i didn't do)POSITIVE still makes addicted ""FIX PUBG"" campaignResultsAll in one I need to say that PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS regressed really hard.(refreshed 2018 08 18)",Not Recommended

DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEThe developer of this game is making money hand over fist and does not care about the quality of the game as there is little to no competition. I suggest playing Fortnite or to wait for an actual competent dev team to make a working game in the coming years.

Game released now so i'd thought it would be best if i edit my review.Vaulting is very solid and fun but the game developers have not fixed the real issue with the game.The Netcode Servers of PUBG are still running 15hz while good servers are supposed to run 65hz.The server performance is clearly noticable while playing the game you get shot after you get in cover. Damage takes a while to go into effect. Example I quickly peek another player and shoot him. He looks up but i duck into cover again. He shoots and a second after the shot i get hit in the head while i was in cover. This gunfight was CQB so there is no excuse for this slow bullettravel and hitbox issue.This game will not feel solid and after 200 hours the fun of winning doesn't feel like a reward. Its core issues arent being worked on or resolved so i don't see PUBG being a longtime favorite for most people.,Not Recommended
Pros Best benchmarkKilled by a naked girlCons Chinese should be removed from playing other servers they're all cheaters. Game has the worst anti cheat.,Not Recommended
It might be a game that had all the potential of blowing Triple A gaming out of the water which it did. It pulled off what most indie companies DREAM OF. But than instead of doing everything to go and give the middle finger to this world of microtransactions overpriced DLCs and lootboxes it goes and joins on the bandwagon with lootboxes before the game even came out of early access I have held off on this negative review because I wanted to believe but as of this review. The game still is not well optimized I run into glitches constantly and overall this is just a experience I can not do without friends. Which is a shame because it holds potential for a market saturated by the battle royal experience and while it might have made it popular it definetely could be improved. I write this more out of disappointment for what this COULD have been rather than what it has become. For while it can be enjoyable still I would rather just spend my time in other games where I know I can have a consistant and fun experience without the fear of really getting frustated by dumb ways to just die from game breaking bugs from textures not loading in regardless of being on a relatively good computer and a SSD drive to a object actually loading INSIDE of me and causing me to just be stuck until the zone kills me or I leave. Me and my friends have gotten frustrated about countless things in this game that are more or less out of our control. While this had so much potential I am disappointed to see the route that this game did take.,Not Recommended

I'm not aware of any streaming/harassment drama involved with the game developers or streamers but I can tell you what's wrong with the game mechanically.For a game that is as succesful and popular as this game is you'd expect more frequent patches and improvements to the technical aspects of the game and not the streaming and video capture features. It's like painting your nails when both your hands are broken.Aiming a gun with or without a scope is like flipping a coin. Sometimes you completely miss other times you get headshots with shotguns from 50 feet away. Graphics engine and textures are horrible. It feels like you're playing an unfinished alpha for college computer science project that some kid started and forgot about 15 years ago. Doesn't matter how powerful or up to date your video card is what settings you enable or disable in the config it looks terrible. I don't know how they got their screenshots but the game doesn't look like that even with every video setting at max.The car physics are ridiculous. If you've ever played GTA5 and laughed at how some of the cars handle playing PUBG is like that except you die. Usually for no humorous reason at all. The interface is atrocious and was obviously designed by a developer. The inventory management screen makes no sense at all. Let's put everything in one giant list that you have to scroll through. Seriously guys hire a qualified UI/UX team and at least make your game look professionally made.Basically this game is getting a lot of attention and a lot of money as a result but the only things the developers seem to be working on are the streaming and video capture features. Instead of improving the game engine physics interface and graphics that should be at the top of the list.,Not Recommended
This game has a lot of potential but at its current state it really is a hit or miss each game. I dont have the latest expensive graphic card or processor but they arent bad either. The rounds are a hit or miss due to the fact that buildings dont load in properly for like the first 1 2 minutes atleast 5/10 times. This will either get you killed or set back quite hard to the people that do load in properly. Furthermore server stability isnt to best either and lagg happens often aswell. However if the devs do keep up their work and optimize this game further i would play it again. Just at this time i would not recommend buying the game due to the fact that it is so unstable.,Not Recommended
It's fun in the start but it gets really repetitive and boring.After many times of playing and knowing its a Early Access Game it has a lot of bugs and gliches that people use.A big minus is also the Lag spikes that happen on the server where cars sodely drift in the air and Players and teleporting around. Players getitting killed but have suddely killed your team or yourself instead.Only Recommend this if you have about 20 min to waste and want something with your friends.I hope more mod's will come to this.,Not Recommended
why would you have a esports tournament before you fix your laggy as balls game. i can shoot somebody with the same gun but he gets me down in less shots or i can get 1 shotted by a akm with level 3 armor. the game would be good if they actually worked on it and fixed the bugs how can it make so much money and not fix just another case of a alpha game making all its money before a full release and not bothering to fix its the devolpers the probably got there degrees at phoniex university trash mother ers,Not Recommended

I know it's early access but the horrible optimization alone makes me not want to recommend this game to anyone in its current state. It eats up RAM and video memory like crazy and keeps constantly crashing due to that and the memory leak forces you to restart the game after every round. Do not even think about playing this game if your system isn't at least 2x better than the minimum specs.However they have announced promising optimization changes for the future and I will edit this review to be positive then.,Not Recommended

Welp since this game ended up beeing that much popular its good to say few words about it now.The performance has improved vastly over the course of last 3 months. Patches actually did something but there is still a lot of work to be done in order of making this game playable. Right now on decent pc you get average of above 60 fps. 3 months ago I was jumping in joy seeing the counter go above 45.There are still bugs. But that is not the thing now the game is still in a early access.But about that promise devs really shouldn't be that disohnest when they made the promise about not monetizing the game more untill full release. Now we have system of keys and cases. What is more dumb organizing an event revolving around competition in an unfinished game.Also... Brendan should take it easy go blow off some steam cause what he does inside his PR tent is just off.If this keeps up I'll be really disappointed. The game has so much potential going for it.

This game is full of glitches and bugs. It should be named player unknown bugs and glitches.I understand its in early access but the more patches they releases they more glitches it creates they sold 6 millions copies and their servers are 10 tick rates with 150 ping i'm getting lags every game EVERY games and most of the time you get NETWORK connection lost etc...Dev works hard on releasing patches for PAID CRATES so make more profit but where are the servers improvements ? Where is the support for all the problems in game ?Last patch killed my Sound effects. I now can't play the game anymore because any sound effect has a HUGE distortion.I wish I could ask for a refund. Don't buy wait for the FINAL version because there are huge chances that the final version will be full of glitches still and DEV won't give a since they have your money.,Not Recommended
The game itself is decent with a lot of interesting things and mechanics like shooting out tires on a car. However the endgame (10 20 left on solo) is pretty bad. It takes skill to make it to the end with luck (rng) having only minimal affect on you but once you get to the end the luck (rng) has major impact on how well you will do. There is of course still some skill and strategy but luck at the endgame can either screw you over or make the game for you. The circles (playzones) seem to be completely rng at the end rather than being neutral which ruins endgame content.Plus an obscene amount of cheaters/hackers. Despite many claims to fix this they have yet to do so successfully. You wont typically notice it unless you are consistently getting to/near the end (10 20 left on solo).,Not Recommended
boring game for boring people but its kind of fun if you're playing with friends.If you're playing solo and your play style is aggressive (searching for kills moving around alot) then you'll lose alot of times.also sound system is ed up you'll have no clue from where you're getting shot and there's no markers or anyhting telling you like cs go.1/5 solo experiance 4/5 when playing with friends.,Not Recommended
Very enjoyable both alone and especially with friends however deeply flawed. I see no motivation from the developers to get this game into a state where it could be considered a complete finished title/experience. In my oppinion not worth 30$ and also yet another example of 'Early Access' being an exuse to release an unfinished game at full price for maximum revenue with no plan to actually complete it.,Not Recommended

I used to love this game but now I wish that I never had brought it.Reasons 1) Developers had broken their promise of not selling in game content during the Early Access. Only 4 month had past after early access release and they already lost honor to their own greed. 2) Developers keep stuffing the game with ridiculous content. For example ads all over the level. They are ruining the atmosphere of their own game to advertise some stuff like online stores(I mean ESL) or they own tournament events on Gamescom. 3) Game performance is terrible. For example my 200$ videocard(GTX 960) can't handle the game on ultra low setting without lagging for 3 30 seconds just on landing. Every second lost on landing is devastating for your survival chance because you need to arm yourself as fast as possible but instead you are lagging standing target for up to 30 seconds!And its getting worse with every patch because developers are overloading video memory with textures of ad graffities and paid content like pink miniskirts! 4) Major game bugs are left unfixed for more than 5 months for example invisible obstacles which could destroy your car when hit on.5) During Gamescom tournament developers had shown themselfs from not to bright side. The event had terrible score rules low quality operators performance and was overcrowded with streamers instead of good players. Very very unprofessional as for my opinion. I no longer believe that game will become anything good. With every patch it's more game of ads and miniskirts and less about guns and tactics.Think twice before spending your time(the game is very hard to learn) and money on this game.,Not Recommended
Devs only care about money and skins . The game stutters without a reason on any graphical setting with no performance changes .

"You think that they would actually adress some major issues in the game before their official ""release"". On in particular I am fond of is the parachute propblem where you get stuck in the air right before you're about to drop and get your weapon. It's amazing that at the most crucial part of the game where you're completely volnurable and unarmed there is such a bug that will completely you over. Kind of feels bad when you drop at the cartel drug mansion on the mexican map and you get stuck in the ing roof while all your enemies scramble to find weapons. When you finally get unstuck and see that glowing mini 14 with 3 boxes of 5.56 and a slight bit of hope the you get one pumped buy some with an s12 because he was able to get a gun before you. Terrible game. Don't waste your money.",Not Recommended
So i played this game for around about an hour. It felt like what i was expecting except it was stripped of almost everything i was expecting. Its not even worth the buy in my opinion. I wonder how many dislikes i will get but seriously i did not enjoy this game at all.EDIT The game may get better when it is out of early access but probably dont buy the game is still quite empty and probably wont be when it is out of early access.EDIT 2 After revisiting this game a couple months later literally nothing has changed and now the game always crashes around when you try to exit the plane. I cant even play. When the game crashes other programs crash as well as a result of this game crashing.,Not Recommended
Very slow paced to a lot of campers more on the desert map (The bigger map) Lots of bugs Servers a bit laggy Low FPS New map looks cool Takes a long time to find people unless you go to a big city 95% Of game time you spend looting or camping in the corner of zone If your in the centure of the zone then you will probly get pinched and then get sniped in the head If your not in the zone then you will probly need a car because the maps are big Not solo game (very boring) have to play with friends to make it a fun game Instead of making the game better there sueing the components (Which is fair enough but i still think they should make there game better) Very overrated A lot of fan boys that will say the game is 'perfect' when its far from it (They are not joking they are being 100% serious) Graphics arnt as good as what people say Most the people who say this game is good are people that dont want to say that they spent 27 on a bad game or console players that are just saying its good because the amount of popularity that it is getting and they play fortnite so they cant say that game is good so they say PUBG is good...

"Terribly optimized. Creator cares more about profits from crates than fixing the game. Buildings dont always load in my specs are well above the recommended.Game freezes all the time Multiple restarts are sometimes required just to play 1 game. Just sad how the game was very profitable and instead of reinvesting money back into the game to make it more enjoyable for consumers the creator just implements more ways for him to profit.Would be a pretty decent game if not for the unplayable bugs that rely in the game and have been there since the beginning of release.Also connecting to games is a hit or miss and you might just not make it and have to restart.9/13/2017 Edit 5gb update and none of it is improving optimization. They also stated ""PUBG declared its updates would become less regular so as to maintain a ""high standard of quality"" moving forward."" basically stating updates will come less frequently showing that the bug fixes will take longer to come in and seems like they just don't care about the playability of the game. I do not recommend you getting this game for many reasons.1. The devs do not care for fixing problems that have been in the game from the very start.2. The optimization is poor and there looks to be no correction of that in the near future or maybe even the future.3. $30 is an outrageous price to pay for a game with this many problems. Wait for a sale and i dont mean the one where the game goes from $30 to $29. It is not worth the frustration that will inevitably come from you trying to play the game.Lastly they can see that their game is doing better than their counterpart ""H1Z1"" so they would be under the impression that they won't need to change anything big in order benefit the user experience. After promising they wouldn't do ""DLC"" they released things otherwise because they see the profit margin that games such as ""Counter Strike"" ""Dota 2"" etc is pretty large. And in thinking that they would want to pursue that alley of content in order to increase the money they made from the game but refuse to reinvest in order to provide a game we deserve.Edit It has now been over 6 months since the initial release date. The game was said to be out of early access in 6 months. Too much work for the PUBG team? Too many bugs they care little about? Too many ""DLC's"" that you pay for to be released before the game is out of early access? Just sad.Out of ""Early Access"" review Game fully released. Tons of bugs still present. Game is still terrible optimized. The only real big difference is you will not find this under the early access games. Still garbage still not worth $60. Still not worth your time. Play a different game don't give the owners of this game any satisfaction by playing their game.

I love this game and I wanted to grind it out quite hard after waiting more than two weeks for the release however I came to a huge dissapointment.After buying it straight when it came out I couldn't run the game at all and I still can't after some time of waiting for the optimisation patch or something like that. After going through pretty much every post on the forum and tutorials on youtube how to max out the performance of this unoptimised I give up. The minimum system requirements are a total lie and only the best rigs can run it fine... It's a shame but I will still wait for the patch because I really enjoy watching the game and I would be even more pleased if I could actually play it. For 27 I expected much better. As I said there is nothing wrong with the game itself it's just the performance and optimisation section which made me not recommend this game at the current time. After some months I will revisit this game and do another review of this to see if anything changes.UPDATE After the optimisation update and buying new RAM I have little to no problem of running the game.,Not Recommended
Can somebody please explain to me why this game still runs plays like a pile of hot garbage still?? It's been over a year since release and they can add in all this new content which is good but they don't seem to care enough to optimize the game and make it feel good to play. The amount of pop in buildings still loading after landing and stuttering even on LOW settings is absolutely unacceptable.,Not Recommended

Desync issues lag issues and the lack of kill trade makes the game super imbalanced. With the amount of players playing the game you'd think they'd have invested in some servers. I can go from DOTA 2 and play with 40ms ping to this game where I'm constantly at 120 150. Invest in your game might be a good idea instead investing in fog maps and hats.Do not buy this game until they fix the issues mentioned. If your lucky enough to live close enough to one of the servers you might have a good time killing everyone else that has worse latency/desync.Oh and there's thishttps //steamuserimages a.akamaihd.net/ugc/858355614969126502/A54FE324B51AF518FC9E77308441A9E445C3D090/ Enemy drops with no buildings spawned drives a vehicle through all buildings/terrain because he can see every person/loot on the map.

"This game is the most garbage piece of that you can possibly spend your money on.The game still feels like its in early access the game runs like complete dog even when you have a super high end PC. The game is debatably not even playable for the first 2 minutes of the match because of server lag so you have to drop away from groups of people to avoid dying from lag. The game is prone to crashing and memory leaks no matter how much ram/vram you have. you can't shoot out of a vehicle because the game runs like and you go from 100 to 15 frames while peaking out of a car(should honestly just take it out the game because you're more likely to be shot out the car. You can only shoot out of a vehicle of the person is driving completely straight down the smoothest of roads.. Vehicle mechanics are trash and unrealistic for a game that focuses mainly on realism. Cars flip and do barrel rolls after hiding the tiniest of bumps. While driving you'll randomly crash into an invisible pebble that will make you do front flips or just have the same effect as hitting a brick wall. If you get inbetween two object the wrong way you'll be glitched intbetween them (with the only way escaping being knocking yourself away with a grenade.) There have been times that I have glitched through the floor and the only thing you can do is swim under the map. You crash AT LEAST 1 3 games and it WILL be durring an important moment that your team needs you or when the game is about to end or when you're simple trying to run to zone. This game is prone to hackers (Like shotgun your entire squad out of a moving vehicle or just no scope your entire squad) or killing your entire team with a single clip of a gun. Grenades in this game make little to zero sense at times. Someone could throw a grenade at the opposite side of a house with there being litteral walls inbetween you and you'll still be knocked out. You can throw a grenade right ontop of someone and that person either gets slightly damaged or be completely unaffected. Shotguns are extremely inconsistent in damage you can shoot someone with no armor twice with a shotgun and they wouldn't die. you can have level 2 3 armor and helmets and you'll get oneshot with a shotgun. There were also times where I sniped someone decently far away (70+ meters) with a 2 pump shotgun. Guns in this game aren't balanced at all. It's not even that guns are preferenced over others some are just inferior in every single possible way to others. You'll spend most of each match running to zone you never find a vehicle when you need one. Or other players ahead of you just shoot out all the tires of every vehicle you see. Majority of your games where you choose don't land near the center of the map you'll walk the entire game then die to edge campers.The game looks like literal They arguably made the graphics look terrible so that it would be harder to see enemy players. The way things are shaded makes them look like they're something else. For example a far away bush will look like an enemy player aiming at you. A far away rock will look like a vehicle. Parachuting in this game is extremely bad (this literally determines how well you do the first 3 minutes of the game which for the most part determines how well you do the rest of the game.) While parachuting you'll get stuck on nothing and hover above the ground likely until another player comes and guns you out of the air like the degenerate you are for playing this trash game. Or you'll just glitch off the roof you were trying to land on. You buy crates with points you earn ingame (BP) which contain clothing and gunskins. You aren't able to choose whice crate you buy. (most of the crates require keys) The key's cost $2.50 These crates are basically ""gatcha boxes"" which have extremely low chances of you getting anything worth while. 99.9999% of the time you use a key on a crate you'll get something worth 30 cents(if you're lucky) so you can't even sell it to make a decent amount of your money back. Most of the clothes you can get in this game look like utter doodoo unless of course the very very very rare ones. If you want specifc clothes in this game you're much better off just buying it from other players. I've saved around 30 boxes for a mass unboxing test to see what i'd get and i've recieved about 10 copies of the same trash combat pants one button down shirt and a bunch of other garbage shoes and pants that are worth 2 cents each.(meaning nothing i recieved were considered rare). This is even more ridiculous because you can't choose the crates you recieve so you can't even decide from which pool of items you can roll from. each crate requires its own seperate key meaning if you have extra keys and another crate comes out you have to buy the next designated key. This game made little progress since early access mechanics are still buggy and glitchy as they were before some things are debatably worse than before. The only actual improvement that I've commended were the change to throwing grenades through windows they used to break the glass but bounce back towards you (made zero sense.) The reason this game has so many players and has been doing decent over the past year and a half is because it had a lot of potential and people had fun playing the game because they understood the game was early access and that the game was on track to be an amazing masterpiece. HOWEVER I repeat ... the game has made very little progress towards actually fixing and optimizing the game. Insstead of actually improving the game they waste time porting an even ier version of the game onto console (at that point it was considered an unfinished game ... and they spent alot of time porting it) they spend alot of time making garbage maps adding more garbage guns into the game more gacha boxes. They're just cashing in on the game right now because it's easier to make more clothes and skins to buy than fixing the game. The only argument against this is that they donate SOME of the proceeds to charity. again only some of it they still greatly profit off of this. This isn't a small company. They've had more than enough time to fix and optimze the game.The only people that got their moneys worth are people that preordered the game for the unattainable preorder clothing and' and or got the limited eddition twitch prime clothing. I made my money back from selling my twitch prime clothing.At the time of writing this review I have about 588 hours average 20% wins top 10% of players for squad games (average i'm not bragging if you're not top 10% you're garbage and should feel bad because most scrubs die first 3 minutes of the game) so i'm pretty qualified to explain why you shouldn't buy this game.To sum it up Graphics are trash Game runs like trash even with a $3000 computer Game feels like it's still in alpha Game is pretty much luck based (you'll either get really lucky with the zone but get really unlocky most of the time) (loot an entire town not find a gun then get rekt by someone that did) $30 market price when the game at this point feels its worth $5 players would rather ruin your game than try to win themselves. The game is trashIf you don't care about the building aspect play fortnite it's free optomized works doesn't crash everyother game better developers they'r actually noticable improving their game. Fortnite's primary game mode was supposed to be a zombie defence game but made a battle royale game mode in about 5 minutes relative to the time pubg spent doing absolutely nothing to improve the game. I'm not over exagerating pubg has plenty of time and money (most played game on the steam charts practically 100% of time time). it's sad they should honestly just sell the game to another company with better developers that will actually improve the game and give it the attention it deserves.",Not Recommended

"Edited for update Unfortunately this will be my last edit for a while until I hear through the grapevine this game has improved or I get fatalistically bored and play it. Steer clear from this game as is because the developer has no idea what he is doing with every subsequent patch where my lag issues have only gotten worse and hackers are more prevalent than ever. (I just ran into a guy who was able to delete the guns I was using. Think about that. As soon as I ran into his radius (I assume) my gun just disappeared. Happened to my co op partner. Sure it could be a bug but it did not look like a bug to me. Edited for update The current lag in this game has gotten worse with the most recent update. The amount of hackers has also skyrocketed. Every time I play this game I run into at least one guy. Hell I was playing Duo with a guy who was able to fire his gun underwater had unlimited ammo and could duplicate anything he picked up. I can't even stomach through what I once was able to enjoy. Definitely hold off on a purchase until this is resolved. I uninstalled the game after reporting hacks/cheats and receiving a WARNING from their forums for simply agreeing with someone that this game has massive hacking problems my first and last post. Original review I would like to recommend this game but I will not.There are lots of good things about this game but it comes down to really one major feature. Tension.Pro Tension like you wouldn't believe.Cons hackers (so far run into hackers that I know of over a half dozen times in two days.) latency issues Firing a full AKM clip into a guy before he goes down where as I take two shots as i'm dodging and am put down.Really those are the two cons.The latency issues can sometimes seem like ""hacking"" issues and frankly it'll be hard for a lot of people to tell the two apart I've had years of admin experience in FPS and consider myself somewhat of an old hand when it comes to realizing I've been stiffed.It can be fun but again I have the best internet possible in Chicago and playing in the NA server I'll be finding myself putting 5 headshots from behind into some guy only for him to turn around and destroy me. Instances like that will have you go ""lag or hack?""When this happens every other game its more than frustrating. Its a shame.If you are like me and get frustrated at these things this game will not be enjoyable.Here is an example of a frustrating match Landed in the military base managed to kill two people (one with my fists vs his pistol because pistols are god awful) and one with that very same pistol (P1911) into a prone looting guy in a corner. Pick up a M416 and a silencer. Then find a kar98 and kit that out. Find a Mil vest 3 and helmet 3 and various other goodies.Run across the bridge to the ne and find a crate falling from the sky. Camp the crate for two minutes and kill one guy with the kar as he is trying to loot the crate. Run up to crate and find the MG. Grab that and drop the m416 and run to a nearby buggy. Drive buggy to the center of the white ring and jump out. Find a second story building where I camp a door with no windows. Sit in room. Player numbers tick down from 60 40 30. I stay in the same room. 20 18. Same room. White circle moves to outside my room but still covers the building. I go to the other side and do the same thing for two minutes. White circle moves so I jump from the balcony to the floor and make it to another building where I repeat the same process. Now 15 left. 10. Sitting in room guy opens the door and I blast away at him with my MG. he just stands there looking at me. Then shoots me after I've finished firing 100 bullets close range into him. I die from one pistol shot despite having full armor/helmet 3. Yeah... no thanks.Half the frustration of this game comes from the incredible highs you get... to be undercut by what I mentioned is again a shame.It's possible this game will be worth playing in the future. I'll check up on it every now and then and update this review as necessary.",Not Recommended

This game is horrible. It runs on the newest unreal engine and yet the developers made the game look like absolute dog Every game I go to the areas that supposedly have the best loot and instead I find myself armed with only a pistol while everyone else has assult rifles sniper rifles and the strongest armor. I can empty an entire clip into someone with the same armor that I have and they'll be fine. On the other hand people can consistently fire full auto from miles away and kill me in 2 or 3 shots. This also includes inconsistent hit registration and hackers galore so I recommend you wait until the game developers stop being greedy and start actually caring about this game.,Not Recommended

Positive review 1. Better game than H1Z1 KoTK or JS or ARMAs. 2. Loving this shooting game because its different and less arcade what i mean little bit more realistic. OK thats about the good stuffs.The negative review now 1. game still lag the FFP (first person shooter) FOV is sucks what kind FOV you guys using go check Battlefield....even I prefer FFP than 3rd person due to peeking disadvantage and more realistic. 2. ban rules it so bad. So you create unfinish products and trying ban people because they abuse it. Its like selling unfinished automobile and if you hit someone they take your car back. Noo you the manufacture automobile get sued possible goto jail when you know you selling broken automobile. ok ok....LOGIC BLUEHOLE????3. selling skin with keys!!!!! you game is UNFINISHED what the **** SO UNETHICAL just because DAYBREAK doing it and you follow their footsteps. GREED GREED where is the priority finished the game!!!! you sold 2 millions copies 40 millions profits use that money if you are going tournament price money !!!4. Since community support you guys BLUEHOLES at least the one give community free skins as APRECIATION!!! not the one cheap as skins or stupid skins with twitch mark on it.Overall that me off GREED GREED GREED skins skins skins...its should be free!!!!! Now everyone release unfinished game and keep making more money from broken game. Ill give thumbs NO due to the GREED and UNETHICAL doing business.If you buying this game its fun to play with friends but do not support their skins selling. Great community is the community that can boycott this type or kind of business company as a lesson. If the community is dumb keep supporting this type of bad behavior nothing will CHANGE. SO the community need to step up maybe sometimes its ok as whole community BOYCOTT their game for certain company like DAYBREAK for examples until they change their behavior...release complete game not unfinished game.,Not Recommended
Blueholes decision to include microtransactions during Early Access has got me worried as they had previously promised to not do so. I am unsure of the games future and would recommend against buying it for now atleast. I will have to update this when the crate and key situation has been solved. We'll see how it goes but for now its a fun game but i would recommend sticking away from it. Ofc if microtransactions or lies from devs don't bother you it may still be worth buying.,Not Recommended

Another game spoiled by greedy developers. Nothing is optimized in this game. I have issues myself but considering my friend with GTX1080 and having barely average 60fps is pretty ridiculous. If You can't get at least 50 60 average don't even play this game you will never win nor kill anyone without playing dirty. The servers are crap I could speak about their issues the whole time but it's pointless they are unoptimized hitboxes respond like 40% times. Players teleport at times they hit you from ridiculous angles. Servers are simply fu**ed up there's no denying. Most people camp because they cannot get the playable minimum from their PC and as they are willing to kill someone they are forced to take extra precausion. You may have watched some streamers and You never see them camping they obviously know that when it comes to shooting they have all the hardware advantage thus only 5% can only stand a chance with them. Throughout the development I have never seen a patch with engine improvement. They just praise the streamers that can afford the best of hardware our feedback doesn't matter. All they do is add advertisements to the game and more microtransactions. There's no reason for You to go and read more reviews this game is done. After all the income they got the development didn't advance a single inch. It is really not worth Your time there are much much better games than this early access cancer.1.0 Release Update The only thing that makes this game unplayable are now servers. I am 400h into the game and the game still does not register 86% of fired bullets. The funniest thing is when I am watching the demos to avoid what I've done wrong in my plays but the sh*t comming out of the server side gameplay is just nuts. F**k anti cheat measures I prefer playing on high tickrate servers with cheaters rather than with casual players with no aim capabilities that kill me behind the cover by shooting the air not the actual model this feels like a cheat to me really... Fortnite servers are basically the same.I am happy to get a profit of the in game crates not to regret the purchase but that's all I can tell good about the game at current state. The game performance improved but it's still all over the place. I've played hundreds of early access games and I can tell you that PUBG has genuienly the laziest developer team I have ever seen. No wonder though... after tens of games released by Brendan in KOTH genre his dedication gone to hell.Sanhok Release Update This game is still nothing more than a how you've seen previously but now with more crates that you can open with your $$$.,Not Recommended

Despite meeting the minimum requirements this game froze very often for me. Along with that I was unable to talk on discord as the game made me not be able to talk for some reason for half of the time.Also I don't want to support another company adding microtransactions to a buggy and unpolished game.Can this game be fun? Yes. Encountering others players is exhilerating and many cool moments can be made with friends.Will I recommend it? No. It's very buggy and doesn't feel finished. There's even a button on the main menu to resfresh the UI in case there's bugs with it. Do they fix this? No. They add microtransactions instead. Cannot recommend.,Not Recommended
Meanwhile it's still badly rendered and lots of friends are reporting they get into match and buildings hadn't loaded yet or crash before landing they spent their efforts in adding microtransactions to the game. They had promised not to do so before it was finally over with early access and they did it anyways. If this doesn't change beware of buying this game at the momment.,Not Recommended
"This is my hommin opinion about this game.1. Gameplay. Looting simulator when you are looking for items for 30 40 min and then get killed by sniper with single shot. Whole game is a russian roulete so mostly luck decides who would win.2. Lags.How about to play for 30 40 mins and then die because of stucking in a texture of stone riding motocylce. Here we go.How about to by a f****cking chinese supercomputer to play this game without lags?How about to play for 30 40 mins and then your game will crush what obviously leads to your death? And how about same thing happened every 5 6 games?If u don't mind this u can actully try to play it. 3. Desync.In pubg there is a big differene in what is going on server and what is going on your screen.Even desync in 0.3 0.6 sec makes this imposible to win fair 1vs1 fight. You think u were hiding behind the cover? Nope you were busy catching all f*****g bullets enemy shot in you.4. CheatersAll good sides of this game really goes away when you were killed by a chater. Game is used to relaxing not to making me feel my helplessness.5. Bluehole. With all these sides Bluehole really made one good improvement map choise.After community became mad at them.But I DON""T NEED NEW F***NG MAP. I NEED TO PLAY ON OLD ONES AND PLAY WITHOUT EVERYTHING I TOLD HIGHER.And they are making new skin for weapons clothing and many useless thing just to make more money and more money.

More like PlayerUnknown's HackerGroundsHonestly the cheating problem is jokingly bad at this point. Almost every game ends with a hacker wiping out the last 20 players or few teams.I know that people are being very rude to the Chinese playerbase but I honestly can understand the frustration. When roughly 70% of the games you play in any other server are filled with Chinese speaking players it creates a verbal barrier for the community. NA servers and Oceania servers are prime examples of this. Try playing squads with matchmaking and see how often you are teamed with a Chinese speaking person.And the people who are stating that there has been an influx of Chinese hackers are not racist there just happens to be an influx of players who just happen to be Chinese and also happen to be hackers. Not every Chinese player is going to be aimbotting or wallhacking but there is a very noticeable group of them who are. That is not saying that other groups of people around the world aren't hacking I have met plenty of other language speaking hackers as well.I'm not saying region locking the game is the way to go. But I believe a temporary block could help give the team time to create a better anti cheat. The death cam was a step in the right direction! You just need to follow it up now.Also there is also a bug that defaults people to play in the Asian servers despite clicking on any other please fix.,Not Recommended

How this game got a weighted average of 86/100 from metacritic is the craziest thing I've ever seen and says a lot about the state of reviewers and not living and dying by the score on that site. I don't think I need to discuss all the problems this game has and how lazy the devs are. Somehow Fortnite is a free game and the amount of quality work and optimization done to that game is leagues ahead of this trash heap of a game. There's also a more recent game called Ring of Elysium that is almost identical to pubg in every way but plays better and has dozens of QOL improvements that pubg doesn't have. It's also published by Tencent as well lol. There's not much of a reason for me to make this review besides saying don't waste your money on this game since the devs don't care.,Not Recommended

This game has every bit of potential to be THE battleground game. So far all I see is it going the way of dayZ... The content updates are very bleak as of late and the servers seems to be getting progressivley worse. The lag makes every round a toss up from picking up a gun to being shot around a wall as well as bouncing you around a room or out of cover. I play this game a LOT because I want it to be fun and sometimes it really REALLY is! But for what seems like most of the time it is just a horrible lag fest.If the devs can actually stick with this game and see it too the end then it will be great but I am not hoping for anything from them as of now.,Not Recommended

I really can't recommend PUBG right now. I've logged hundreds of hours it's a fun game when it doesn't crash. Prior to September I had no issues with crashes. Now I get 6 a night through a 2 3 hour session before I give up. Nothing sucks more than playing 25 minutes into a match reaching the top ten then crashing. No other games crash. My drivers are up to date. It's just PUBG.Yeah there's botters / hackers / cheaters but the crashes ruin my experience more than anything. I've no idea how they're going to fit in a full release before the end of 2017 as it's early November now and major features are still missing from the Test Server and the Live Early Access servers.There's other stuff but it doesn't bother me. If they get the game stable and resolve the issues before launch I'll update the review. But for now if you haven't bought the game now is not a good time to buy check back in a month or so.,Not Recommended

all in all great concept but devs need to step it up before someone else does it better,Not Recommended
My experience started off extremely well but was quickly stunted by the very high amount of hackers and aimbotters that are present in this game. Every second death was the result of a ridiculous headshot with a weapon that should'nt be that accurate. On top of this the game has started to crash for no apparent reason. I would understand this is the game was small in popularity but given how popular it is and how long it has been out for this is an unacceptable occurance that tragically hinders the game.,Not Recommended
"I've got over 500 hours in this game. I've played it to death.

Do I recommend this game NOW? No wait till well after their release of it. When it works it's pretty great but those games are few and far between and I'm writing this 9 days till full release. It's...bad. It is not worth 30$ it's not worth 60$. Two maps one mode.

While interesting as a concept this game lacks in basic features. There is a lack of actual controller inputs and while this game does use anti cheat software people still abuse solo play by buddying up which needs to be addressed. The game is poorly coded and poorly optimised for what are very much last gen graphics. I am running a GTX 1080 and this makes my PC fans go crazy yet I can run other games on ultra and my PC doesnt go crazy. There is also a long standing bug within the game where by the frame rate drops drastically as a player is rendered somewhere in your area. reducing graphics setting does not solve this problem and it effectively lets people know when people are nearby. It is a heavy drop too going from 60 to about 45 fps for a few seconds. The game is basically rinse and repeat. Good but not great. 6.5/10 maybe a 7 on this games best day. Oh and the hit indicator is dog on a paper platter. It does not help locate where the shots are coming from.,Not Recommended

It could be a good game but this game isn't taken care at all by the devs your pc might not be able to run it for strange reasons even if you have good component cause they are so good at ing up the optimization.Since I have an AMD Ryzen CPU it is impossible to even launch the game the fix proposed wont work and they just wont give a at all.So if you wanna buy this game it's like playing Roulette or you get scammed and you can't even run it or you're really lucky and you can play it.The game wasn't really bad but if the devs let it down after only one year i don't think it's worth buying it.,Not Recommended

"This game has gone straight downhill. Servers are full of hackers with the majority coming from China. Dev claims that region locking is racism But it's not about race he's the one making it about race.We don't care about race we care about being able to communicate with our team and enjoying a fair game. Claims of ""Racism"" is just his futile defense to continue to monatize off hackers recycling accounts.Instead of owning up to the obvious problem and obvious solution he'd rather make the consumers look bad by calling us xenophobic.What a joke.",Not Recommended
To be really honest when I just got this game I sincerely enjoyed playing it. Especially with my friends as a squad. When the FPP mode came out it was the best as I get motion sickness whilst playing in third person. Although I have been really supportive of the developers of this game I just cannot stand the fact that they would rather take the time to find fault with Epic Games rather than actually fixing the problem where hackers have spiked in this game. Also this game is getting rather laggy I run a GTX1060 with 16GBs of RAM and an i5 7600 pretty decent for a desktop I'd say. But in optimum settings I get around 70FPS and sometimes it would get a sudden drop. Will change my review once they fix these problems ),Not Recommended

I really cannot recommend buying this game. Bluehole is milking this one out and is doing nothing to really address the many issues there is. I have had fun playing it with friends but ultimately very poorly optimized game that HAD potential. If I could go back I would but now its a game in my account that I probably never play again.,Not Recommended

Initially this was a fun game. With friends. Even with all the kinks that came with the game for it's price it has been quite enjoyable at times.Game is gradually getting worst. It has been less than 2 weeks since 1.0 release out of early access and I feel there are already plenty of cheaters in the game. Every game has me questioning whether I've been killed by a cheater. It's a terrible experience. Credit to Bluehole for adding the death cam in game. I know now for a fact when I've been killed by a cheater. Let's be real they are cheaters. They don't deserved to be called hackers they don't hack anything. Pros Fun with friends Relatively cheap $30 game for hours of replayabilityCons Too many issues with game (lag bugs glitches and overall instability) Cheaters Lack of quality of life features (can't choose what map to play on etc.) Co op with friends is punishing if someone dies early on (either you play on or restart if your team mate plays on you could be spectating them from 1 30 mins). Although this is arguable as this is the style/objective of the game. Batte Royale.If you are planning to spend on this game because your friends are committed to playing with you then by all means try it out. You'll probably get your money's worth.I don't play this game solo anymore it's not fun. It's not rewarding. Cheaters make it worst. The game looks much nicer and smoother (at some points) in 1.0 but overall it's still a experience.Uninstalled 569 hours.Peace,Not Recommended

bought the game. played it sucks. waited a long time for them to take care of crap. came back game still sucks. its a niche game you either love it or hate it. different style of game from others like CoD or Battlefield. controls feel clunky. and they still have a problem with hackers which is really fun to play for 15 minutes see no one think you are going to make it to the final few and you get shot from out of nowhere or have a grenade thrown into a house that you have been hiding in for 10 minutes and there is no way anyone knew you were there. squad is a better time then solo in this game for sure though if you have a few friends to play with it makes it more enjoyable.,Not Recommended

I got to be honest I bought into the hype of this game. I played it for a while during pre release and did have fun with my friends getting into all sorts of crazy situations but there is a single major problem I have with this game and thus would not recommend it to you. That problem is optimization. I have a pretty high spec rig for gaming with which I have played MANY demanding FPS and MMOs and I was wrong in thinking this game would eventually run decent. The game stutters randomly Frame Drops happen randomly throughout both maps hit registration is the sound can be hit and miss and finally it just feels clunky when doing most everything in the interface. It's not the worst game ever but I got sick of waiting for the game to run like a well optimized piece of software. I'd also like to add that I have observed cheaters in roughly 1 in 3 matches on average ranging from the early days with full auto SKS to the ongoing speed hackers that can run at the speed of light. The servers are also and you'd think with all the money these devs are making off the MASSIVE community they could upgrade their netcode and servers. Save your money and buy something that actually runs and doesn't play like it's still in Alpha. Clunky as hell.,Not Recommended

So far the game is very bad bad for mid range PC's servers have a low tick rate so you can empty an entire mag into someone and they can one shot you with an AK shot to the chest afterwards and you can just die from random things out in the open. The game is really fun to play and when it works it just works rest of the time its torture to play. I hope they fix most of the problems when the full game comes out because now i have a love hate relationship with it. On the plus side the devs are actually listening to the community and are trying to fix a lot of things with the game.It has a lot of GOTY material but its just not there yet..for now i do not recommend this game and i hope things change for the better.,Not Recommended

If you like been shot through the terrain buildings and from across the other side of the map then you will love this game.Nothing been done to stop the hackers probably due to the fact that when banned they are ALLOWED to buy another copy of the game without any problems. I'm sure that is why the game has massive sales figures.When you see the tweets about the massive amount of players banned take into consideration that they all probably bought another copy after being banned.I hope they sort it but they seem to be twindling in updates and I think they rushed 1.0 out so as not to be associated with DayZ as being another failed EA game stuck in beta. This game is still in BETA in my eyes. When players are rubberbanding all over the place and add to that all the other bulls**t it's still beta until fixed.

Edited my review because it came out of early access The problems that were around before are mostly still problems now. The physics are slightly improved and since the full version I have only once been killed by a stationary car. But here's the largest issue with the game Hackers. They're mostly Chinese and there EVERYWHERE. It's really seeming like I end up encountering them in most games that I play. Within two hours I was killed by a man noscoping me through a rock and another guy headshotting my teammates through smokes at impossible distances.

This game has a insane amount de syncs which allows low skill players to randomly get advantages on you cheaters are still rampant which could be easily solved by ""REGION LOCK CHINA"" but that will never happen. Good luck ""hot dropping"" anymore because when you land you can not pick up any weapons because of their code and then you get killed. All of the physics in the game are still very buggy and the hit detection has somehow gotten worse over the years.When Sanhok came out the game ran so smoothly and gave me hope that this game was gonna make it but after two weeks and the joy of something new wore off i could finally see that they were just polishing a turd.

"Don't bother spending ANY amount of money on that game. First of all You need to have PERFECT pc to get at least 100 fps cause even if you're playing on 70 fps and shoting guy that has 80 fps you lose cause the tick rate on the servers are like 5 or 10 and there are tons of t in that game like you shot you see the blood and in fact the guy didnt take the any damage cause tickrate says so. Second of all the amount of cheaters in this game is ridiculous. It's not cheating with simple maphack or even aimbot there are next level cheats like for example no recoil arms extending (yes like gadget arm) to shot the guy from the 100km away teleportation. Game even with terrible lags and worse optimalization was playable on the release cause there wasnt enough cheaters and you could make it to top10 rather easily now You're dealing I would say with 80% of cheaters most certainly triggers no recoils and ""no enviroment mods"". Anti Cheat system in this game is Battle Eye which is the arrow to the foot already You could literally download any cheats for free and yet won't be banned for more than a year.

This game was actually fun. Until it got too big and popular and hackers were able to start making money of exploiting it. Don't spend money on this game until they get it under control. The NA servers are especially bad as all the cheaters from overseas *cough* china *cough* come over to NA to exploit the game outside of their region. The hacking is so blatent that it's hard to say the PUBG devs are putting true effort into the problem.,Not Recommended
This game is absolutely rampant with cheaters and with these kill cams as evidence it's extremely easy to see that Bluehole BattlEye and whatever other anti cheat system they're using isn't doing a dam* thing. This game is absolutely unplayable. After 1500 hours of gameplay the cheater infestation has reached its peak and is causing hundreds of thousands of people to quit/uninstall this game (Myself and all friends included). Unless something is done about all of these cheaters (99% of them being Chinese by the by) then this game will die. Now that Bluehole has the money it wanted it will cease to do anything productive. My suggestion is to stay away from this game if you can help it. Until the cheaters are banned or ping/region locked Adios PUBG.,Not Recommended

No longer early access No more excuses.Update 1.0 still a half baked poorly optimized game with dated graphics. Shame fortnite went the cartoon approach... truly a game that is well polished.This is Dejavu... first we had horror survival games that were only mods on other popular titles then it gets a standalone which turns out to be a total gutter cash grab... then this game. Dejavu360 hours on recordHad so much promise it'll turn out to be another 4 years until 'beta'. Just like famous charities giving your money to faceless companies expect more turnover and lack of actual product or promise of a product.What PUBG is a basic FPS with copy and paste design and structure. A much better version of PUBG is available years ago it was on ARMA 2.The same arguement excuse of 'it is a small developer with a number of actual people working on developing the game design' well after 300 MILLION DOLLARS PLUS 6 months of time to development it is clear the direction of this company like so many before it Rust (Facepunch) 7D2D (The Fun Pimps) Dayz SA (Bohemia Interactive Dean Hall) just to name a few have been in development for YEARS and are no where near closer to being finished than 3 years ago. Now with PUBG it is being introduced to console gamers as an 'early access' game. Another wave of weak willed consumers ready to hand over $ to bluehole or whatever other developer that wants to profit off creating half made games in the hopes that it will gain popularity and become 'viral'. We as the consumers are creating this enviroment and allowing these companies to take advantage of our hopes that they will be good to us and deliver a working product.I would never pay someone upfront for work on my home it should be no different for a video game. Unless as investors we got some sort of return thus far it is broken games and false promises.Bought the game because it was the week 'favorite' for my friends.I found it fun and infuriating as any early access game. Overall this game is a disapointment... Developers seem only interested in adding cosmetics and micro transactions then actually fixing any of the actual issues affecting the player experience.Experience cheaters every day I have ever played this game. To the point I don't want to play it anymore... old feelings of titles like Rust or Arma 2 Dayz Mod level of hacking that really ruins the fun of the game as you can't simply respawn without starting all over.Game is clearly poor optimization and is still considered 'early access' which is pre Alpha... yet this game company is releasing a bug ridden semi working featureless battle royal with poor gun realism?I give this game one year of 'interest' good for PUBG another better company will come along. This game should be called running simulator.HOW DO WE ALL KEEP FALLING FOR THESE SCAMS!? KickStarter/EarlyAccess we are investors with NO RETURN. Ugh I'm such an idiot.,Not Recommended
Came up as a cool concept for a game. but after some time failed epically.* Game monetization yep you can spend money in game for items you don't need* No Anti Cheat lots of hacker from China * No fixes same bugs same glitches * No Optimization the game runs like potato on a super awesome hardware,Not Recommended

this game is awesome in it's idea...battle royale like a boss...but then come the crackers ( yeah hackers are actually those who have a bit of brain and knowledge to make the actual software crackers are the ones jus double click the .exe file ) and poop whole a lot on your game...i understand the the issue of de sync and lag and i can live with that...killcam gives you the opportunity to observe what happened...and when you see ppl just turn arround 180 and start shooting you from far away without any scope you feel robed from your hard earned looting and crawling and bad aiming...so the good feeling is gone...until this cracker/cheater issue is resolved or at least toned down to minimum i cannot give this game thumbs up...,Not Recommended

"If you are looking for a short answer whether to buy this game or not the answer is no. NO. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. (Dated Jan.10 2018) If you want reasons jump into the extended review below.First of all I want to start by apologizing to anyone that has encountered hackers/cheaters in this game. I am Chinese and on behalf of the good(non cheating) part of Chinese players of this game I want to sincerely apologize to all of you. I am sorry that the majority(if not all) of cheaters are Chinese. I am sure you hate them I hate them too. They are ruining this game. I understand your #regionlockchina thoughts but please know not all of us are bad. There are even Chinese streamers cheating and Bluehole did not do anything about it. Unfortunately I cannot elaborate here but new comers please note BLUEHOLE KISSES STREAMERS' ASSES AND THEY WOULD NOT HEAR PLAYERS OUT.Secondly there are lasting server issues that is not fixed. This review is dated Jan.10 2018 almost a month after the 1.0 release. You would think that server would not have issue after the game leave EA. However during this month often player tags/names and clothing items would not load when you enter a game. This game still has server issue days before and after every patch. There is said to be an update Jan.11 and today I had played 5 games where 3 of them I could not enter at all and get connection timeout error pop up screen and other 2 of them I was killed by hackers.Thirdly there are several glitch through out the game and rubberband issues that severly hurt your gameplay experience. In the lobby sometimes some of your friends would not show online even if they are. Sometimes the team invitation will not go through. In the ""new"" map where it is tested on the test server for almost 3 months there are spots you can fall through floors stuck in crates etc. Regarding the rubberband issues I have experienced a lot of times where on my screen I am already behind cover for more than a second and in the killcam I was still exposed. (P.S. I am playing on NA server in Boston)Finally I would mention several things where the game did good even if in current state you should NOT buy it. The killcam was asked for in the EA state they did add that into the full release even with minor glitches it helped a lot pinpointing hackers and cheaters. There are obvious difference in killcam where one is hacking and one is just good. The optimization is imporving with each patch. I have experienced 30fps with GTX1080 in March 2017 to stably above 60fps in my current mid high custom settings. The game itself is extremely fun and the adrenaline rush it gives after each kill each firefight each win is unparalleled. Note I am not going to discuss the incoming microtransaction because everyone has their own opinion about it. But there is incoming microtransaction to be implemented into the game. It is cosmetic only.Note 2 If the hacking issue is fixed(there is incoming Chinese server of PUBG run by Tecent hopefully it will take at least part of the hackers away) then the game would be enjoyable and bearable as glitches and issues are being addressed and fixed. At least they are doing something. Will update review if issue is fixed.At last (non Chinese speakers are welcomed to google translate this). å¼€æŒ‚çš„éƒ½è¯¥æ­» ç”Ÿå„¿å­æ²¡å±çœ¼ ç”Ÿå¥³å„¿æ²¡é˜´é“ ä½ å¦ˆè¢«äººæ“çš„ä¸ƒçªæµè¡€æŸ“ä¸Šæ¢…æ¯’ ä½ çˆ¸å‡ºé—¨è„‘æº¢è¡€æ‘”é©¬è·¯ä¸Šè¢«è½¦æ’žæ­» ä½ å®¶ç¥–åŸè¢«äººåˆ¨äº† ä½ å®¶æˆ¿å­è¢«é›·åŠˆäº†",Not Recommended
I've had this game since early on in the alpha and early on it was definitely worth the money. Ever since the full release though there has been a plague of hackers. I've never really had a large issue with hackers in the past maybe one here and there but it's gotten to the point where EVERY SINGLE GAME me and my group of friends are killed by someone using an aimbot walls no recoil or combination of all those. These hackers have made the game unplayable to the point where every 4 out of 5 games you will be killed by one. The PUBG developers need to step up and make this a priority because the game is quite literally unplayable until then.,Not Recommended
"I hope no one buys your stupid keys for the crates. Micro Transactions suck! The game should get a good performance rather than ripping the money out of the players pockets. Greedy f***s!The ""new"" loot spawn system is ... meeh. I dont really like it. The new map was cool at first but now it got boring and everything feels the same after a few times played.",Not Recommended
I don't recommend this game right now. Maybe wait a couple weeks until the anti cheat patch comes out. Game started off great. Super intense. Heart racing the whole time....but...now....its gone. Hackers hackers everywhere. Every game has atleast one hacker to ruin that match for everyone. Next concern is the items in the game and I know its random every time but I went through 2 whole towns with about 5 buildings in each without finding a single optic or ammo for the weapon I was carrying. The very next game I find 3 red dots in one building the next has a 4x power and 2 holo sights and the very next building has 2 AKs 2 more effin red dots in the same room not to mention the other holo sight up stairs. I know it seems petty but it happens pretty often. Main concern is the hackers fix it.,Not Recommended

This game is such a headache because of the developers. I have played other shooters which are battle royale based such as h1z1 and fortnite but the netcode and how you have to manipulate it just drives me nuts. I dumped 200+ hours into counter strike losing and dying every round and maybe killing 1 to 2 people every 45 minutes because its fair. I was the reason i got killed and i realized that to be better at the game. this game is just garbage. wether its getting killed in cover you land before someone but they are mobile before you somehow? or you land on a tree about 10 meters away and kill yourself from the fall. do not purchase if you want an optimized and fun game to play and hopefully climb up the ladder.,Not Recommended

Do NOT buy this!It's by now an unashamed buggy cash grab. It's a 30 that is more aggressively monetized as comparable Free2Play games. instead of fixing the many bugs in the game try to prevent the widespread cheating or at least release some playable content they introduce Event Passes. That are twice as expensive (per day) than the ones that the competition offers and give you less interesting loot. Did I mention that the competition is Free2Play?I'm not saying this game is dying but it is certainly beyond it's peak. The future is elsewhere.Go play the Free2Play alternatives that are better better maintained more fairly monetized and are MORE FUN.,Not Recommended

1 000 hours played so yes I got quite a value from this game. However it's been riddled with issues and plagued by cheaters since day 1 and while they've made improvements they've also made a habbit of snubbing the community with their decisions time and time again. There's a reason the NA playerbase has dwindled so much and the AAA BRs aren't even out yet. GG Bluehole,Not Recommended

"Can't say much has changed since my last review. This doesn't feel polished at all. There is a huge problem with hit detection &amp Pings. Honestly how many of you have unloaded 8 rounds from an AK into somone's chest and then just get double tapped and die?.... This whole experience from the very beginning has been a disappointment. As pleased as I am with the optimization it is vastly overshadowed by the game breaking hit detection. Sure you can say it isn't that bad. But you're only fooling yourself. The call of duty franchise runs better than this game could ever dream of. Framerates still fluctuate from 35 120fps (1080ti/6700k/16gb of 2400mhz/samsung850 EVO/250Mb down 50Mb up) for all the trolls out there that think my specs suck. Still fun to goof around with friends if you don't try to win.This game is going to flop hard. I really wish to be proven wrong because it could be awesome. But its all in the developers hands now.Pros +Game runs considerably smoother+New mapCons Hit detection is completely broken Still requires a beastly PC to run smoothly (on low settings) Only 2 maps at launch Framerate loss is significant Sluggish looting movementTLDR ""Where'd my shot go simulator 2017""",Not Recommended

I've played this game for a little more than 1 000 hours now and I can now say that I'm done. I've played this game since march 2017 when it came out in beta and the hackers have never stopped and they seem to be back in full force. 3 games in a row and the last game had at least 2 teams hacking. Our team got knocked out by a singly guy who was auto locking and spraying our heads in third person view with a m416. He then died to another hacker who was spraying his QBU wildly across map and shooting people in the head every time. That same player picked up a kar98 then started jumping around head shotting people without even aiming down. Too many hackers at all times for me to keep on going. At least until they can fix all the hackers I have no idea why they plan to release a ranked system before they can even fix the massive hacking issue. All that's going to do is give hackers an even bigger incentive to make more and better hacks,Not Recommended

"Okay as someone who has played a little over 250 hours made it to top 100 NA I feel like I might be qualified to write a review. I feel this game has promise but there some glaring issues. PROS Vaulting. This game needed vaulting for so long and its a welcome change. Terrain load times have been greatly improved since the release of early access. Deathcam feature is a nice change its been in other games for years. Allows for people to learn from mistakes immediately Replay system allows someone to analyse their matches from any angle to improve their position play and get better through film work. Gunplay in first person is really nice and is fairly smooth. (I main solo fpp) bullet drop is in the game which makes sniping at long distances a nice challenge but once you get good at it you can destroy people. CONS There are too many hackers a lot come from china and have infested everyother region. These hackers are making the game less fun to play because of their aimbot and are basically impossible to kill. That can be fixed by region locking chinese players to china. The lag on the servers is insane. The servers can either bless you with making you almost impossible to kill or make it so another player doesnt get hit. This is a must fix to have competitive play be possible. Its super frustrating to have what seems to be several shots to a body of another player not kill them. Replay system shows how bad it is but registering 2 of your 7 shots hit for like 33% of their health. The last big concern I have about the game is that it crashes. Not only does it crash but its always at the worst times like in top 10 for instance. Ive looked up supposed ""fixes"" but none of them really seem to do anything to help. This is a MUST fix it makes me not want to attempt to keep pushing my rating. It makes me almost not want to play the game because at the most intense moment without fail my game crashes thus killing me. I can't recommend the game in this state its too unpolished and theres too many issues to pay $30. Once Bluehole fixes some of the issues it'll be great. Buy if its on sale or when they region lock china.",Not Recommended

You may as well be flipping a ing coin. What makes this game good is when things go well. When things go well It can be funEdit Im not really sure I can reccomend this game anymore. As months go by and very basic issues stay the same I'm starting to think this game will never change. New guns sound fx and textures are cool and all but its honestly like polishing a turd. After about 100 hours of experience I can confidently say that this game isnt meant to handle 100 players. Hell even 80. Try landing in a hot zone its a giant fest. Players warping several meters at a time players hitting you behind walls (and I thought battlefield was bad about this now I think its wonderful in comparison.) and some broken rng where an entire apartment complex will contain nothing but a pistol. I find that after a couple games I start to get mentally exhausted. At all the above mentions and the fact that I just spent 20 minutes looting only to get killed by someone camping a tree. I wouldnt mind dying so much if it didnt take 20 30 minutes each cycle starting up a game and getting looted. It just creates this frustrating atmosphere that really takes away from the game. All I can think of when I die is ""here we go again thats another 20 minutes wasted trying to get back into the game."".

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT ANY COST DO NOT INSTALL IT EVEN IF IT GOES FREE. THIS IS A STEAMING PILE OF GARBAGE UPDATE 3 last update deleted game 14.10.2018 Continued played this game on and off since start. The game goes wrost bad to worst. This game has the same glitches and bugs since the early apha version of this game even tho now its full release for about a year now (of course it was rushed due to presure from competition) the game on top of the old bugs and glitches that never got fixed has new bugs and glitches due to updates that are horrible eg. the god mod bug. This game is early apha or beta AT BEST. The devs put a lot of crap work in skins and keys and boxes (even thoe they promissed to NOT HAVE those in the game before the game was released the game is circled around skins now similar to CS GO) the game is in absoluteley horrible state. COD 4 just came out never palyed cod tested beta first now i got it purchased and its flawless compared to this pile of steaming (and i never liked COD mind you and played battlefield and arma in comparison).UPDATE 2 10.07.2018 playing this game on and off since start. last few months i have bearly played a game where i was not killed by a hacker! Usually when there are no hackers we play in the top 10 with 1 out of 10 games we have chiken diner. Today we playd again and 2 out of 2 deaths we were killed by hackers with snap on hacks headshots from 500+ meters without clear light of sight. Finally uninstalled the game and not looking back.Original review do not buy unfinished products like me ... wait till the game is fully compleated and ready to be played. Game is filled with bugs (as it should be in alpha/beta state i mean it is expected) and even being in this early state it should not be recommended till full release because things like dayz standalone happen ... 5 years later we still waiting!wait and buy on full release after reviews!update 1 2 Oct 2017 6 20pm the game state is worst than when i wrote the review ... it gets worst with every single decision they do ... no optimization whatsoever!

This game is honest to god GREAT. But it has issues it simply DOESN'T adress.I live in OCE right next to where china plays out of and all you ever get is people hacking people turning off their models so they can walk around invisible people firing at you through an entire CITY of walls people aimhacking and wallhacking and its not so uncommon either you die to a hacker at least once per 3 games at LEAST some days its back to back to back to back hackers that force me off the game I can say I LOVE THIS GAME ITS EVERYTHING THAT FORTNITE ISNT. But fortnite doesn't have a hacker problem and fortnite has good framerates and a more active playerbase because they didn't off their playerbase by adressing issues with nonfixes and letting it RUIN the game. I'll probably play more pubg and weather these HACKING CHINESE PLAYERS. (were not xenophobes by the way we just don't want hackers in our games brendon greene you idiot.) Don't buy pubg.

A game live platform in China is called Douyu. There is a game anchor called Lu Benwei. He used the game cheat software many times in the live broadcast of the game and was found the main game cheating evidence by the mass players but his main account was not banned by Blue Hole. It is said that the host is on the list of Blue Hole's neglect so I want Blue Hole to verify whether the game host is cheating on the game. Chinese game player to a reasonable explanation because the game in the gaming industry anchor China major influence misleading teenagers.,Not Recommended
You need a decent computer to run this. I have above the minimum required specs on my laptop and when alone can run around and pick up items but when multiple people are around the game is unplayabale.

Pros Fun game with lots of replayability Multiplayer experience with up to 4 friends Constantly being updated Supposedly free maps still to comeCons People using hacks ruining the game Players being randomly banned for no apparent reason Severs are contantly down Poor optimisation Frame drops freezes and stutters Even on powerful machines you can't competitively play on higher settings Hundreds of game breaking bug which have been addressed by the community but yet to be fixed Game being rushed to be finished so they can release it on console which leads to even more bugsThis is a very fun game but I stuggle to recommend it with the recent behaviour of the company they are prioritising finishing the game to get it on console and charging full price.,Not Recommended
If you don't always have a full squad of people you know and you don't speak Chinese then don't bother.

TLDR PUBG is not very goodA broken mess of a game on every platform it's on with a dev team with their heads so far up their it's amazing. They didn't invent the battle royale genre and god forbid you try to make a battle royale game (that imo is better and free) without the risk of getting sued. Maybe I'll come back if they can ever get their act together.,Not Recommended

Product received for free. You'll see negative reviews remarking about how its wandering around until you just get jumped and murdered weird U.I clunkyish controls loot boxes cheaters and all the other stuff. If you haven't just poke around you'll see them. However while all valid criticisms I think there's one big real major problem with this game.This game has no soul.There's no personality no charm no depth. Scratch the surface of this game at any point besides the skill curve and you'll hit the bottom right then and there. The game just exists and there's nothing that really makes this game unique or stand out in any way aside from its popularity and being in a fairly uncharted genre. Show me a screenshot of this game and I'd have trouble identifying it if the logo wasn't plastered on the shot.So hang on what WOULD be an example of something with everything PUBG is lacking that I mentioned? Borderlands. Those games... they're distinct. For example when you see something from Borderlands you KNOW it is Borderlands. That series has its own art style its own personality and flair when it comes to world story and gameplay... it stands out and its unforgettable whether you love it or hate it. Those games ooze with personality they simply make too good of contrast. And for more examples? Almost anything Nintendo Armello Warframe The Long Dark Aion City of Heroes World of Warcraft Wild Star Turok Fallout... and that's just off the top of my head without thinking too hard. I've not even played all of those but the souls of those games burn so strongly you can't help but recognize them.PUBG... it has no soul. It's a lifeless large scale free for all PvP generic shooter whose only claim to fame is being famous. And while it'll probably be spoken about for a long time by virtue of its explosion of popularity in time it'll most likely just serve as the stepping stone for something better something with soul to take charge and truly define the battle royale genre.,Not Recommended

"As of right now I cannot recommend this game to anyone at all. This game is fun as a concept you and up to 3 friends are thrown into a map with 100 other players all trying to kill you. This game is not the first to do this but it is by far the best option if you're willing to give this game money. Streamers are a big problem. If you kill a streamer who wasn't paying attention then they will accuse you of stream sniping them and that means you guessed it! A temporary to permanent ban.Region lock is not a thing. Right now hacking is a serious problem and the players hacking are more than often from China. That means they can hop into servers for other regions and ruin the experience for everyone else. This game is supposedly the 5th most played game on the pc platform and if that's the case then this hacking crisis is absolutely unacceptable. Wait to buy the game until they stop listening to streamers whine and region lock the servers...(or until China bans it for ""violating socialistic values"" or some other bull )",Not Recommended

More like AsianBoy HackerGrounds. When this game was first in EA it was great despite all the performance issues etc. (which is only expected from EA.) There was so much potential (still is) and the game progressively got better and better. There was a noticeable moment in time that my experience in game with friends went from wildly fun and addictive to less than desireable and no longer wanting to play rise of the hackers. I had such high hopes for this game (as did we all) and with claims that no region lock or vpn bans will be issued I'm afraid this game is going down just like H1 Z1. Simply solution REGION LOCK. Ban them and they just make a new account and come back. No one thinks region locking is racist in fact you will be doing your entire NA (and more) player base a favor. Wake up PUBG Corporation.,Not Recommended

Can't recommend this game until its glaring issues are fixed. You watch the kill cams and people are shooting 10 feet to the left of you and killing you.Got to top 2 in a game fired 10 rounds with a VSS at the last guy and was hitting him dead on no kill. He kills me I watch the kill cam and he's not even aiming in my general direction.Don't appreciate having a victory taken by how buggy a game is. The only time I can reliably get kills is when I'm within 30 or so feet of someone. Past that distance it appears to be glitched to hell.This game is NOT in full release condition.,Not Recommended

Game is heading where ARK is at now. Where they care more about the they add then how they can make the game perform better and run better on mid to high end pcs. I've seen people with 600 dollars builds get lag and a stable 60 fps. However they have to run the game on the lowest settings. talk about the lobby being buggy the start of a match giving people with expensive pcs and better connection a big advantage. No west or east servers on big countries like europe or US. I've played this game a lot and the game is really fun but it still triggers me to see when I could've got that chicken dinner but died due to me having a lag spike or it not reading my bullets.,Not Recommended

"I got in on this one pretty early before it's ""release"". So I've had quite the ride with it's up's and down's over the period. It's certainly more polished and works better than when I first bought it for myself and my friends over a year ago. However the quality of the matches have declined steadily since then. Cheaters have been somewhat curbed now and are no longer as infuriating common as they were a few months back. However due either to the declining player base it seems like you're almost always going up against people with insanely fast reflexes pinpoint aim and eyes stolen from an eagle. It's getting very uncommon to get into good fights in duo and squad where it's not completely on sided. This drastically hinders enjoyment as 8 9 out of 10 drops ends up being a roflstomp. It may just be my age or my play style hindering me here but it's an issue to everyone I know who plays this game.The direction of the game has changed a bit as it blew up in popularity and its frankly gotten extreme scummy. We've gone from crates that were 100% earnable and openable by gameplay to an overwhelming amount of paid key crates. Something we were assured would only be for a special event became the increasing norm. The item drop rates for crates has sadly remained every bit as sad as they were when I started however. Expect the same 2 3 items over and over with exceedingly low drop rates for anything else. Not as bad an issue if crates are free to open but now with the ever increasing rate of key crates being introduced it's ludicriously stupid to blow cash to get a crappy hat 3 4 times in a row. Also major issues like bugs physics and other serious issues take a back seat to whatever new paid crate they're getting ready to push. Gamebreaking issues have been left live for months before while paid items were released left and right.It's hard to talk about the company's recent scummy cash grab turn without pointing out that they are as of this review suing Fortnite for copyright infringement. And while this is going on they've stolen several gameplay mechanics from Fortnite wholesale. This includes a new level system on test server that was 100% lifted from Fortnite right down to the paid season pass. The company has seemed to either run out of ingenuity or integrity possibly both. I cannot recommend this game on any platform besides mobile for this reason. As mobile seems is run by a different company it's far more advanced and plays better than the PC version. Sounds like it's also less of a cashgrab setup oddly enough.TL DR Buy this game only when it dips under $15. Expect games most of the time due to matchmaking and bugs. Also expect the game to probably die due to lack of players soon. Just play Fortnite or PUBG mobile for a better experience.",Not Recommended

At first glance this game has everything a survival shooter needs to become successful and it does have potential but I cannot agree with the way the game is being managed after all why spend 30.00$ if you ll just be banned from playing. If you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time you could be banned for one semi famous streamer s accusation. The rampant lag spikes of chinese players creates time travel like abilities allowing them to enter building without being seen shooting you when they are on the ground and the language barrier makes them useless in team combat and that's if they don't team kill you first. Game breaking glitches that will make you either die or wish that you did. Creaters would much rather call you a racist bigot or xenophobe rather than deal with the shortcomings of the game.While I believe the game does hold some promis the road it's going down doesn't look bright.,Not Recommended

Product received for free. So I left a drunk review awhile back on the game. And now after all this money after all this supposed work being done to the game nothing has really improved.If I could give my friend his money back for this game I would.This kind of game can be had elsewhere for cheaper or free.Pretty much nothing has truly been fixed. The game still runs like the server(s) have only gotten worse memory leaks still slide in to up your day... I don't watch people stream this so I can't speak from experience but apparently it's very easy to get banned for stream sniping lmao.Supporting an abortion of a game like this will just perpetuate the cycle of early access and alpha/beta testing games for years to come.Stop itGet some help,Not Recommended

Luckily I've been able to break away from PUBG hard to believe how fast it turned to I recently read that the playerbase has dropped 50% since January makes sense. Good riddance.",Not Recommended

Great game until you get to a better rating then it's just Hackerunknown's Battlegrounds from then on.You will spend 20 minutes looting and gettings kills just to die to a hacker in the top 10/20s.Until they fix the hacking issue (which they probably will never be able to) then i'll give this game a thumbs up.,Not Recommended

There are many things i could say about pubg and first of all i think the most important thing is to see if the game is actually evolving in regards to network issues bugs framerate issues etc. I am currently running this on a i5 6400 and a gtx 1060 so keep that in mind that my criticism is adjusted to my own PC.First of all when i bought the game around 8 months back it was a lot of fun the game itself feels refreshing and it's not like most shooters so that's what made it fun for me and made me able to see past it weak points but after playing around 50 hours the issues that are present just kill the experience. When you put 20 minutes in a map only to die because you're stuck your motorcycle just randomly decided to flip you died in a firefight because of desync the zoneplacement is really off (like being on the other side of a mountain or on the other side of the water with no bridge within the zone) or any of the other bugs then it can really sour the experience. Youre in the plane? Great the moment you try to jump the plane decides to drop you facing the other way which results you into being disoriented what just happened and losing an edge in time. When you finally are in sight of your target your parachute decides to start heavily pulling left making you spiral away from your target. You landed you're lucky normally you would've been dead already because your landing sucked. Let's go loot some houses! First house you find 2 extended mags for handguns because we all need those extended mags for handguns and a crowbar. In the house besides you you hear shots from an ak being fired at another person outside. You run outside away from the noise so you can perhaps find a place without people in the hope you can find a gun. Second house you find a random amount of 556 bullets without a gun and a gas tank you leave sprint towards the third house and you manage to find a handgun. You're being pushed by the person with the ak and you take your chances your game lags before you manage to fire and you're dead. The reality is this game suffers from the same bugs that it had during its alpha fase and during its beta fase. I tried thinking about some improvements that they made and they made some like for example when you reload a clip and do something else it doesnt cancel the whole reloading. But mostly the same bugs are still present in the game. Random cars flipping network issues (and they happen so frequently it feels like WoW vanilla patchday all over again) parachute issues where you get stuck your parachute becomes uncontrollable or gets slowed down framerate issues assets loading in issues issues with crashing issues with drivers. And then i still havent mentioned ANYTHING about hackers and cheaters because of the way this game is set up it's not likely you would be banned for cheating due to the immensely flawed system that they use. They made hundreds of millions of dollars and what did the consumers get in return? Locked boxes that need money to open them (bluehole said they needed the money to fix the game) and new maps which for a long time even continued to dilute the experience. The way zones work and the way they interact with a big map like miramar kills the whole battle royale experience. If you had a game that rarely was subjected to bugs then a big map would've been less of an issue but because of the very long games playing on the miramar map becomes a drag and hard to enjoy.I'n the less than 300 hours i've played i encountered lots of bugs and almost 90% break the game or make you gain a disadvantage. Getting stuck not being able to loot servers lagging everything works seamlessly together to kill the whole fun behind pubg.Did the game improve these past few months? Not really they added some new features gave the UI an update and now we're getting a jungle map but is that really fixing the issues that've been haunting this game for some time now? Nope. Is it worth 20 euro? I think so especially with friends its enjoyable but for the love of god dont try to play it too seriously because the mechanics and the issues will smother your fun with a layer of rage. I will be happy to see when this game burns down since the developers made no intent in showing that they want to improve the game. Locking skins behind money isnt content or bugfixing. Not being able to enter the game being stuck in lobby being thrown out games the servers not working not being able to draw your weapon because youre for some weird reason to close to an object not being able to prone on flat surfaces and many more annoyances that i forgot to mention. Dont buy this game if youre gonna try to play it seriously. In all honesty even though it's a fun game it's usually more frustrating and non rewarding than fun.,Not Recommended

the gameplay is fun people seem to talk about hackers but that's not the problem for me oh no the problem for me is the amount of ing bugs this game has how many times am I going to put 4 bullets into someone with the m16 and not kill them while they shoot me once with the shotgun and pow I'm gone like a ing jew during ww2 also when I use the shotgun it doesn't do (the blood does show up) the game crashes when I try to exit the actual game not a match and it locks my system a game before writing this review I saw a guy and I started shooting him for some reason tho (the gun was full and I didn't switch fire modes) I stopped shooting literally no reason behind that the sound design is poor either you are getting gang banged by 4 people or there is no actual way to figure out from where you're getting shot from. The game is poor untill the devs fix the bugs and the glitches y'all need to do something cus your reviews are getting negative real fast at the time of writing this the recent reviews are 40% positive (November the 22nd 2017).,Not Recommended
yeah its true that hackers r destroying this game. Its unfair to all players including Chinese who without cheating... Im agree with the opinion which lock Chinese server.

The influx of Chinese playing on the NA server along with the hacking has made this unplayable. Even if I get a group of friends on all at the same time so I can actually speak with my teammates we'll play for about 15 mins before getting picked off by shots that while not impossible would not happen almost every time I play. Until this is fixed my negative review will stay.,Not Recommended

Good potential to be a great game. Already filled with people using aim assistance software and other types of cheating arrangements.Glitches are many (though they are trying to fix them) such as sound being an unpredictably horrible tool to tell where people are. Sometimes you can here people as if they were right next to you (while in reality being 3 stories above you in a different house while other times not hear anyone at all while they could remove earwax with the silencer attached to their gun.Lag is inevitable and feelings of losing games to ingame flaws rather than poor shooting skills are more than likely to be felt multiple times.When you do win a game you feel great. Needs a ton of work to really become great and not just an annoying where you happen to get lucky sometimes.I recommend the game but only if you have faith that the devs actually fix the major issues the game has.EDIT Still WAY too many bugs. Hit registration being client sided is utter and many MANY exploits to drop quicker with the parachute and to never actually taking any damage.This game would be recommendable if the price was 5$ at this state. Hope the developers are gonna get their together.EDIT Hasn't changed a single bit i a long while and is filled with more cheaters than regular players. This game is complete garbage and the devs should be ashamed of the piece of game they have created! Doesn't care for the fanbase and just lets cheaters roam freely!,Not Recommended

But it auto opens and you can't sell the items on the market...""It's too bad I'm not interested in Blackout or BF5 BR.Release UpdateAt this point I haven't played the game in months nor can I bring myself to play. The focus on skins and microtransactions when the game feels like it's half complete. Sueing Epic Games because ""I did battle royal first hurr durr"" when this game is based off of a mod based of off a game based off of a movie a move that my end up with the license for the engine getting revoked. The general ery of the devs. I had hopes that Blue Hole would be able to actual improve their game to the point that it doesn't feel like a chore to get through load times lag FPS drops etc. There's no hope that this game will be improved unless an entierly new corperation were to obtain the license. Maybe one day there will be a good semi realistic battle royal. It certainly isn't Playerunknow's Battle Grounds.Early Access ReviewWhile I enjoy the gameplay the lack of optimization this game has makes it really hard to play some times. It's sad considering the fact that opimization has seemed to take a back seat to a myriad of other issues the devs seem to think are more important. Such as Banning players under false pretenses of stream snipping Porting to console even though there's a plethora of issues that need to be addressed with the PC version Microtransactions to sponser a tournament that was for all intents and purposes a PR flop btw it was said by the devs that the only paid product that would be introduced to the game before the actual release was the game itself Lack of fine tunning new weapons before they're added to the game Simple quality of life fixes (server prefence perspective prefrence settings that you can only access in the .ini etc)However the gameplay is interesting though it leaves you wanting. The map is too big for this kind of game leaving you wandering across empty fields and forest never seeing another player until the last 30 or so people. Shotguns tend to feel random sometimes one shotting a player then failing to do half their health in the same circumstancethough be warned as this is my experience with them. Buildings loading in as blobs and staying that way for the first 2 3 minutes of the game with the only known fix being to by an SSD. A personal issue that has casued me many deaths that could have been avoided is FPS drop when firing in CQC.The game is enjoyable it just has a very long way to go before release. That and the devs need to get their act together and focus on what's important to the health of the game rather than belly aching streamers and their pockets. I regret having ever spent my money on this game as well as every hour i've put into it.",Not Recommended

"After 350 hours of PUBG I decided to write a review of the game. It was fun in the start getting kills and such with friends playing squad just to die from a glitch that would shoot the car miles up. But now...I feel nothing for PUBG. Nothing that could win me over and say ""Let's play some PUBG"". There were game breaking bugs such as small rocks could flip your car and explode or go under the map by riding a bike. And don't get me wrong those bugs still exist. And in the end I didn't really care about the bugs. I don't see anything fun in PUBG anymore. The only thing I cared about was kills and in a decent round I can get 8 without even winning nor did I care about winning.In conclusion PUBG was nice about now it doesn't seem it is as enjoyable as it was before.

Do not purchase this game until Bluehole has region locked it.If you are from OCE regions I highly recommend avoiding it entirely.After huge promises from Early access mutliple broken promises and back tracking over server progression microtransactions anti cheat strategies reporting methods time frame based promises it's very obvious to see that Bluehole cannot handle how big this game got and how quickly it got big.The OCE servers are infested with hackers and taking a week off then coming back to play 1 game and get killed by a cheater is disgusting.The server tick rates are appauling and well below the standard of almost all other FPS shooters on the market. The game is broken and being pushed with an engine that the developers aren't adapting to.I've sunk a LOT of hours into PUBG and play it with friends on my discord and it's definitely disappointing to see this game go from Early Access (Closed) to Early Access Open to 1.0 Release and drop the ball so heavily.PROS The game can be a lot of fun with friends The gun play isn't half bad when the servers are behaving There's enough playability for various play styles and can encourage people to try something new There are regular patches and updates The devs are somewhat transparent with what they have planned.CONS Huge amount of broken promises Exceptionally poorly optimized causing huge loads and overheating of CPU Cheaters galore with a flawed reporting system No region locks Jittery gameplay for the first 5 10minutes of gameplay where the servers cannot handle the load. Buggy broken physics engine often sends stuff bouncing around in ways they shouldn't. Cars hit literally nothing and get collision damage and explode without warning.Ultimately The game is fun but the frustration of a DEV team that REFUSE to address the hacking issue is turning me away from the game and it should turn you away too.I'd love to recommend PUBG but in the state that it's in with hackers so predominant and a dev team who cannot hold true to promises and address issues plaguing the server loads and tick rates I'd highly suggest staying away.,Not Recommended

I started playing PUBG last summer during the 'Early Access' Phase but I decided to wait for the release of the game until I would write a review.After the 1.0 release I wondered if this game really deserved the version number 1.0 because PUBG was far from being a complete game worth the 30 (price in EUROPE). I wanted to be fair and gave the Devs more time to listen to the community and work in some improvements.NOW six months after 1.0 the situation got worse the game still looks like Arma 2 considering it's UE4 game. Especially the LoD is really annoying and the AA doesn't work correctly. Despite that PUBG is still poorly optimized and the netcode is 20th century crab. Although the game led the steam charts for a long time and made tons of money through crates and market PUBG Corp. was unable to use their financial resources to set up a capable server architecture. Instead they're implementing more and more crates skins and othe bullsh**. But the real straw to break the camel's back was last patch when they introduced the EVENT PASS! WTF 30 are already too much for a game like this and now the're adding even more useless crab combined with useless missions to pay for!?This had been an eye opener for me PUBG Corp. doesn't want to improve the gameplayand create a good game together with the community they just want to fleece as much money out of this game as possible for their Tencent owners.bye PUBG,Not Recommended

This is a great game if you like playing with hackers. I get 8+ kills per game most of the time and make it to the top 5 10 and a hacker kills me and or my team. The asian hackers are toxic and all over the NA servers and now that they have enabled kill cams its so much easier to confirm you were killed by a hacker. Devs need to stop working on improving the game and focus 100% on anti cheat until they can get it figured out. Hackers have litterally killed the game for me...might give Xbox PUBG a try. And with 200+ hours and 60+ hours on the test server it seems to have gotten worse after the 1.0 update for hackers.,Not Recommended
This game is a neat thing all of the best pieces of the PVP from something like DayZ or H1Z1 without the tedious crafting or respawning.I've put over 100 hours into it both in EA and 1.0 release and as it stands I can't reccomend it until Bluehole addresses the absolutely overwhelming issue with hackers (that has seemingly increased with the official release.) Of the 10 games I played even this morning at the time of review atleast 9/10 of those I was very obviously gunned down at over 500m by someone using an aimbot.

I have played this game nearly a 1000 hours and after that long I'm seriously considering uninstalling. This could be a great game if Bluehole PUBG or whoeverthe would actually make this game fun. Millions of games sold and the quality just isn't there. It's better than it was but nowhere near what it should be if they actually want a great shooter. I have seen so many bullets pass right through people reticle right on a person and the shot is nowhere near them in ADS and so many little game choices that just make the game less fun. The vehicle physics are a joke. I was so excited for the new war modes and then I played them. They are kinda fun and you get more shooting in 15 minutes than you will in an entire night of regualr pubg. I don't even play the single player PUBG because it just bores me...I have to play squad or duos and the points from those modes are just pathetic.TL DR This game has so much potential and it's being away.,Not Recommended

Concept of the game is briliant. The way the developers are taking care of bugs and performance issues is quite the opposite. FPS drops for weeks if not months loads of bugs in the game (buildings missing on the mini map motorcycles flying around de sync issues) which need a quick fix but all the developers are busy with is promoting their new map. Just check out the PUBG reddit page and see where you will find the most developer replies (hint their new content).,Not Recommended

In the beginning the game gave a rush and was fun to play with friends but now that game is infested with hackers mostly from China. Every game and every server has them. Avoid this game until they decide to do something about this problem. I will no longer play this title until them. It is a shame this could have been a great game.,Not Recommended

Companies need to make money from their game.However PUBG Corp. is taking the cash grabbing to a new level.

"Nope game is going down the hole. Taking way too long to fix core problems still plaguing the game. PUBG Corp is Korean owned and they are just in it for the money they couldn't care less about the spirit of the game. The original creator seems to not want anything to do with the game anymore even. janky physics inconsistent gameplay mechanics. random updates that lower framerate and make the game a stuttery mess again. incomprehisible hit detection client side is just lazy and promotes cheaters. obnoxious push to buy loot crates going back on early promises of them only using one key then having to buy a new one for each new crate. game updates with little to no testing even though there is a Test Server?? critical core gameplay changes with NO TESTING OR MENTION (Core audio processing changes with bugs galore and no one knew anything about it. tedious cycle of annoying gameplay updates then reverting them. Sure some people can still have fun I guess but we should expect more and deep down I know that the current developers are just wanting to keep the ""hype"" enough for players to buy as many loot crates as possible and if people stop buying them the game will most likely just be abandoned.",Not Recommended
trash lmao,Not Recommended
I bought the game when everyone was playing. Wanted to see what is all the Hype. My advice is to look elsewhere. Some recent games like Fortnite and other survivor games looks much better than PUBG. PUBG is just getting too old and I wont even talk about hackers. The games are packed by hackers and they can not do anything about it and that is the main reason I stop playing. Because you really have two choices hack or be hacked.,Not Recommended

"As someone whose followed the development of the origin of this title when it was just a standalone mod. Supported it through early access and all of it's trifles it's gone through. I've ignored the rampant cheaters that you meet within every 1 out of 10 games I've ingored the trend of ""loot boxes"" locked behind a paywall with no other way of obtaining those items without thousand of hours of gameplay to obtain one trashy item. With the recent release of the ""event pass"" and paywalling these missions that litterally every other game has including Call of Duty (a real cash cow) without this pay wall. This is an EMBARRASSMENT for bluehole and this is the reason why Fortnite is so much more popualar than this game. I do not suggest this game in it's current state until bluehole puts some actual effort and takes care of the community that built this game. The reviews matter Bluehole. You may have a high playcount but these reviews share similar feelings to those on Media streamers alike. This is a game that I'd love to play more of once issues are resolved. A game I would reccomend however was the recently updated Standalone DayZ. Because I'd rather a slow developer over an awful developer. Or rust both are fantastic games. However PUBG just doesn't deserve the community it's gathered.Bluehole you should feel dishonor for something that the community loved dearly and now is a laughing stock of genre you streamlined.",Not Recommended

TOO MANY CHINESE CHEATING SCUMLove the game and despite it being fun to play both solo and with mates the chinese cheaters are out of control and now the newly introduced killcam clearly confirms this. Nearly impossible to win once you reach top 10 as a asian cheater will kill you from a kilometer away without even zooming in and with automatic fire mode with every bullet connecting. The DEVs really need to up their game and prevent cheating vermin. Best to just ban China connections from entering any servers.

This game is absolutely riddled with cheaters and teamkilling Chinese.It's to a point where cheating is an expected part of the game. I honestly think that people cheat just so they can even the odds which in turn is creating more cheaters.You can tell by the way people behave. Instant headshots running around killing people in the open not worried about taking cover carrying crappy guns and getting loads of kills. Even just watching the kill notifications you'll easily see some people get 10+ kills per match almost every match. And if you know anything about this game you'd know that its not a noob friendly game. It really does require some skill at FPS/survival games.I've played hundreds of hours of games like COD DayZ and many other similar titles and I'm pretty good. So either there are people who are so good at video games that they should be serious professional gamers or there's a serious cheating problems plaguing this game. I'm going with the latter...,Not Recommended
"If the game was optimised &amp had better perfomance if the game had fewer bugs or if the game at least was better looking maybe I could recommend it. But it does not succeed in any of these areas. The gunplay often feels clunky frequently performing inconsistently similarily too its FPS throughout any particular match. The developers outright refuse to restrict player regions to those with at least a common language ruining any strategy or plan players can devise with their teamates. Further this worsens the problems with connection leaving you in limbo mid game waiting for PUBG to reconnect you to those on the other side of the world. The graphics look as if you're playing a game from 2008 and the bugs and hacking issue just exacerbate the problems leaving you feeling cheated out of a fight or ""chicken dinner"".However the game does provide an experience although one that is laughable in its current state that is somewhat fresh and realistic in design. If you can bypass the above mentioned issues you may be able to enjoy the game ignoring areas it failed in now and focusing on what it was intended to be. But $30 USD is too much to ask for a game that is just 'mediocre' and far from the claimed ""World's premiere battle royale experience"". It's an experience infested with problems that never seem to be fixed but rather hidden with a new update or map. The game should not have been given a full release in its current state but niether should a broken game like this be $30 USD even in Early Access. The addition of crates adds some progress into the game offering a small reason but a reason nonetheless to keep playing. However unless you want to spending $2.50 on a key per crate for new boots or a different coloured shirt which is almost a 10th of the amount you paid for the game initially the crates become a constant reminder of the wasted time you've spent playing this broken mess.With 170+ hours played I've given it more than enough time to see improvement. I've watched it go from early access to a full release and can safetly say that the game has seen minimal imrpovement often seeing changes that actually make the game worse such as the crate system. Those updates that do seek to change for the better do so so insignificantly or with such little focus on the real issues that they may as well not have even bothered initially.This game does not deserve you're money.",Not Recommended

So if you're thinking about buying this game then think again.It has been absolutely flooded with hackers. To the point that they're openly advertising on the forums and not even trying to hide it ingame. Same with the ingame leaderboards being used to advertise such things.A huge percent of these hackers come from a certain country which was stated by the developers at BH and so the community said we want pinglock/region lock to fix this problem.BH response is that anyone who agrees with this is racist and xenophobic.So if you are expecting the developers to do anything about this huge problem then please think again.I enjoyed this game at one point however me and my friends no longer bother with it and i highly recommend you stay away from this game with the way it is right now.,Not Recommended

The only thing that sets this game apart from other BR games is the fact that it's the only one without stupid gimmicks like Fortnite and Realm Royale.

The fact that the game has an e sports league is absolutely amazing to me because the utter lack of consistency is mind boggling. They take forever to release any kind of substantial update and when they finally do it just makes the game worse and even less consistent.

And still it remains as an unique phenomenon to me. Even big laggs or some bugs couldnt stop me from playing. Neither did it take away the fun for just a second. It was a pioneer game so what? Everyone had the same problems and so it seemed fair. Just give the developers some time to create a masterpiece. All this will be fixed. From all the early access games that dissapointed this will be the one. So it would seem. It was all the time clear that a big game a massive project would take a looong time to be perfect (e.g. starcitizen). To me it was already besides some teething. BUT after 1 year of patience its enough. For more then one year i m reading every single patch note with growing lack of appreciation. The so called ""full release"" was the first big lie. It promised to fix all the bugs all the horrific netcoding and even double the content with a new map. Yet i can say that every randomly generated map from minecraft looks better than what they try to sell you as a big improvement. Miramar rocks are just huge squares standing in the desert that are barely painted because the map had to be released in 2017 to fullfill the promise of a fullrelease before 2018. Time to give some optical improvements to those poorly designed and low detailed structures remains unused. We re in the middle of 2018 and they just released another new map. The rocks are less in numbers and only a minimum of details has been added. Still stairs and houses appear to grow out of a pile of sand instead of having at least some sort of realistic foundation. Its not that i m to much picky when its about graphics its just that everyone is having a little bit different point of view or a different realisitaion point but its going all to one point &gt It just shows that there s no one giving a **** what they are producing. And they re showing it far to obvious. Instead of taking a little bit more care of repeatedly reported problems like the networkcoding or even smaller problems like server stability anticheating not loading textures roughly working lobby ... ... ... ... which all are game essentials (more or less). To be fair it took cs a long time to fix delayed hitboxes but its just one of many points that is untouched for far too long. Especally if theres a forced full release which is claimed to be ""esl ready"". The opinion wishes and the expectations of the community stays ignored far too often. What happend so far 1. Maximised the number of payed chests. 2. Adding an exclusive parachute skin for ""just"" 5$. (is that a DLC or what? No. its just a badly painted parachute for the first 10 seconds.)3. 10$ mission pass to have access to some kind of rewards and half of them are just temporarely unlocked. WTF? Are you serious? So you re making ppl buy your game and then they should pay like one third of the original game price to have access to a 2 3 weeks mission series with ""fake"" rewards? The only thing worth to get is the rename reward so i can rename myself to ""imnotafcknretard"". Oh wait you could do the same by just playing the game for some hours. So WHY? The sad thing is i even know many ppl buying this ridicioulus offer and i hope that on one day they will realise what theyve done to themselves. 4. There was an article I dont remember exactly how it was written because its been a while but ill try to reproduce the meaning. 50% of our income are from China so thats what we re taking care of most. Surely China has the most players so thats where the money is coming from but how it was written was more like an screw the rest of the world chinese are willing to spend more so we dont care about the english speaking peasants. In general all of the articles they publish seem more than just cocky to me. I cant help it maybe i m just too prejudgy too but i have my reasons.The only thing that forces them to at least sometimes take care of the needs of the community is growing competitors. Which they tried to keep small unsuccesfully. The pressure is growing and with small events they re trying to keep the players at it and testing new features like dynamic weather and many other nice ideas. They started to be creative again but till something fundamental is happening i wont bite anything.In the end I can say that compared to the game one year ago many things happend that helped the game alot. Many improvements that made the game more stabile and playable. But all these things were only the side dish served to some bitter tasting payable weapon skins and introduction of sham rewards/dlc's.

I do not agree with the direction this game is going or with the behavior of the companies behind it.

Sound has made no sense to the point that you hear gun shots directed towards you in the completely wrong direction.

"The game was honestly enjoyable within the first few patches Upon the introduction of the Mini 14 update (perhaps slightly before) the chinese had begun plaguing the NA server along with EU and OCE (excuse me if i missed another) and at first it was just a lag/peekers advantage until now these last few weeks they have been BLATANTLY hacking by spawning in loot shooting through walls from miles away and it's all in the death recap. This game is SAD. So much wasted potential I'm honestly used to it since h1z1 and dayZ were let downs I still have faith however PLAYERUNKNOWN needs to get his head out of his *** and ping/region/ lock the game he says it's ""xenophobic"" however the game is supposed to be competitive (sure its an RNG fest) but battling to get number 1 spot and be the last man/team surviving is competitive and people want to try their best to win and with chinese hackers/laggers with advantages RUINS the game. On top of that searching for random teammates is ABYSMAL since chances are none of your teammates speak english and the chinese are all playing from pc bangs (internet cafes) with open mics therefore having to mute your whole team. Once this game is region locked and hackers are punished with IP bans rather than just account bans so the offenders can just buy a new copy THEN I can reccomend this game.

"I have played 40ish hours of the game and will NO longer play this horrible optimized poorly created unimaginative money hungry and unprofessional developer lie of a 1.0 game.I truly wish I did not give Bluehole my money. The game developer calls his player base ""xenophobes"" for simply trying to Region lock since lag happens frequently because people are from vast distances across the world. Instead of the developer (Brendan Greene) trying to fix the issues his players are having he acts unprofessional and curses/swears through his interview using the expletive F**k . Mr. Greene does not stand for his players and instead disrespects them. I don t see how region locking is a bad alternative since it only makes it fair in terms of lag and implementing this poorly optimized game. I do not see this game lasting 6 8 more months. There are two maps a 3rd person and 1st person perspective and nothing else to the game besides a typical battle royal game. Other games are creating Battle Royal modes and becoming more popular since they already have an optimized game and instead ""adding"" to their already existing game.For anyone willing to purchase this so called ""game"" please take into consideration that the developer does not care about you as a gamer nor does he act like a professional developer and human being should act Respectful. Another thing you should consider is that the game was stated being a 1.0 game yet they still act like Beta. Console systems cannot handle this poorly optimized game which sends a red flag that they did not put the effort where it was due. The company and developer keep stating how they are working on the cheaters. You would think that by 1.0 they should have already had that under control yet it is still just as bad as start of early access. The development of the game is at a snails pace on any and all fixes toward the game.I personally have nothing against any culture any religion and any race. Yet when we as gamers help fund a game and the developer tells the people who helped him get where he is that we are called by Greene ""xenophobes"" because we want to help improve the game where it is fair and runs better for every player. There are always ways to assist ones player base but calling us ""xenophobes"" is not one. I do not speak other languages however it makes things very difficult having someone on your team not understanding you or you understand them because of the language barrier. I did not say a specific race culture or anything negative besides having language barrier.So to all fellow gamers out there please take my words into consideration before getting this game.

I've logged almost a hundred hours in this game so I think I can write a review and have some knowledge of how this game works. So is PUBG good? NO. Not in it's current state at least. This game has SO much potential to be a great game but right now it's pretty bad. The DEVs continue to not fix actual problems of the game like bullet lag or actually optimizing the game but instead test new maps that nobody has wanted and add gunskins that nobody cares about. In all honesty I don't hate this game it's just too poorly optimized the DEVs don't really care how the game runs and the replayability becomes stagnant after 100 hours in.

"The gameplay itself is truly riveting and intense. It is soul wrenchingly painful when you are taken out by another player in the top 10. I've even gotten 3 wins so far (2 duo and one squad) but that is not the point of this review.My issue with this game is Brendan ""PLAYERUNKNOWN"" Greene's (The creative director for this game) inability to keep a promise. He stated that there would be absolutely no monetized content during this game's early access period yet here we are with a newly added in crate system very akin to that of CSGO's. You can currently purchase weekly lootcrates that don't require keys to be opened with in game currency yet that feature is slated to be removed and replaced with the ""key crate"" system once the game comes out of early access as well.Tsk tsk. And here I was hoping that this game wouldn't go full CSGO in terms of skins and loot drops. I honestly hope this crate system is removed and reintroduced further down the line when the game is more stable (further bug fixing and optimization patches). Vote with your wallets people. Let Mr. Greene that we will not stand for microtransactions or paid DLC in early access games (just look at what happened to ARK when they released scorched earth). More importantly teach him that it is a disgusting practice to lie to your dedicated players and then use the excuse that the ""crate system needs to be introduced to the community before the full release"" to cover up what is an obvious act of pure greed.",Not Recommended

"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME... I have played the hell out of this game but as of late it has become nearly impossible to play a round without being killed by a cheater. I remember when i could play TPP in the NA server and not have any problems but then it got worse and i had to move to the EU server again it became unplayable. So my friends and i finally switched to FPP and it was okay for a week or two but then they began taking over those servers.Here's my take on the problem the game has a bp system in place to buy crates that have cosmetic clothing. this clothing can be sold on the steam marketplace for money sometimes in the hundreds so the cheaters will accumulate bp fast buy crates and then open them in hopes of finding a valuable item then they sell the item and purchase a new copy of the game before becoming banned.Bluehole keeps saying the anti cheating measures are a top priority and yet the hacking gets worse and worse and it always seems to coincide with the release of a new crate with new valuable items worth selling. I imagine that if they removed the monetary incentive a lot of the problems would go away with some time. Without crates and items to sell they would be forced to spend their own money to repurchase the game after a round of mass bans. This company had a good thing got rich quick and now they're just riding the microtransaction train to retirement. In short despite the hype you may hear about this game do not purchase it until they come up with a solution for the cheaters or you'll find yourself wishing you could get a refund like myself. There is a reason that every post bluehole makes and many reviews inclue the phrase ""region lock china""",Not Recommended

"It's an online sensation there are so many players and the game is extremely fun... for about an hour if you're playing with friends. Alone the joy doesn't last that long although it can be terrifying!At version 1 there isn't anything other than 1 game mode playing first person or third person isn't another game mode it's just another way of playing.There are some really satisfying moments in the game and when the game doesn't lag the mechanics are brilliant. I love looting and adding attachments to weapons to create your own style of play. But the play doesn't last long enough. Most plays are spent looting a lot then getting killed from a distant sniper. It's fine when playing Battle Royal as that's what the game is but for the price tag it feels like it's missing something. It's not a juicy ""get your teeth sunk into"" game it's more like a casual game with a heavy price tag. I would like to see a lot more game modes to give the game some legs otherwise it's just another open world shooter without the ability to appreciate the world.",Not Recommended
Despite not being the inventers of the genre Bluehole have been trying to sue their competition for being slightly similar. Failing that they go ahead and rip off Fortnite's and other f2p games's business models turning a full price game into a microtransaction filled ripoff.

This game is so boring you can not imagine it. If you have a low or mid range PC you are at a serious disadvantage because the game is so unoptimized the framerate drops to single digits when you get into a conflict. That takes all the fun from the game. The game goes like this Loot &gt Camp &gt Loot &gt Camp &gt Loot &gt Camp. A new player with a high end PC using a pistol can kill you even when you have full lvl 3 gear and best guns. That's how unoptimized the game is. And that's not the only boring part. The most boring part is there is nothing else to do. A full price game that only has two huge and one middle sized map and nothing else to do other than loot camp shoot and die. I have this game for two or three months and I only played for 17 hours and most of them was on the first week. I would refund it if I could.

Don't get me wrong PUBG is a very fun game a 100 player battle royale with stress inducing moments which can mean life or death. I had tons of fun despite my short hours of gameplay and its ability to top out at 2.5m+ players while in Early Access is one hell of an achievement. HOWEVER PUBG is flawed perhaps very flawed. The game contains a good number of bugs and glitches server latency which can lead to your unfortunate demise if in a firefight or in a rather bad situation and the good 'ol hackers occasionally finding where you are despite being well hidden (sneaking into a building that you know is occupied by another player quietly finding and waiting at the perfect hiding place and yet he manages to find you and thus find yourself screwed by a gun aimed at your dumbass head even though he doesn't even know your position in the first place) and taking your head clean off in a single shot. And microtransactions. In an Early Access game? Really? And I recall them making a promise about NOT putting Microtransactions in Early Access. The devs need to put their act together. If they don't improve the game we could see a drop in its popularity and lose players bit by bit. Even if they have 2.5m concurrent players.tl dr fun but flawed. Very flawed.,Not Recommended

A game that was very fun and different in the first few months of play. But after 200 hours it is very apparent it is a game where improvement is not something most players can accomplish and is primarily dominated by being lucky enough to find the m4 first.

The game will start off fun. It'll take you a few matches to get the hang of how it all works becoming familiar with the map which weapons to use if you find them catching someone off guard. But you'll soon come to realize that this game has a rampant cheating/hacking issue that the devs seem to not care about in the slightest. So far they have refused to even set a ping lock. You'll light someone up see all sorts of beautiful blood splatter yet your target doesn't die and you've been killed. A quick review on the kill cam shows that the server never even registered you hitting your target.The furthest this company takes punishment is by banning the product key. They do this because the vast majority of people banned just repurchase the game and continue to hack for another month until they are banned again. I've made it to the top .12% on solo first person pespective and can tell you that you'll play more games with hackers than without.,Not Recommended

If you want to play a game that frustrates the crap out of you to the point that you want to put your fist through your monitor and smash your keyboard and mouse this game is for you. It is a game that has its good qualities and can feel addicting but at the same time infuriating and you wonder why the hell did i buy this game. The issues at hand range from cheaters all around in a game that is doing nothing really to alleviate the problem and the moment they found a solution it causes crashes and lag issues and they got to reverse back to the old method which you suddenly see an uptick in fishy play... also it seems like when the cheaters are blatant it takes a long time for them to get banned. Enough time for them to hoard a bunch of wins and get a bunch of crates to sell and buy the game again with minimal loss and do it all over again clearly the company does not care about getting their game under control and weeding out these people permanently and would rather just keep selling subscriptions to cheaters rebuying and ruining their community and dragging the game down.Still lots of glitches black screens and no load ins... when you can crash on a 2 inch pebble with any vehicle and explode and die. Also the loot system where you can land with a few people check 4 5 buildings to find not a single weapon but rather useless and get shot by the guy that got a gun in the first building they looked at while you looked at half the city to find nothing. They really need to rework this randomizing of items and luck rolls to balance out whats the point to land and check so many buildings and die because the guy had no effort to find a weapon its like a big F U.I found myself enjoying the games at times and the thrill of being down to the final 3 or 4 to bring in the win was a rush but all these other things just dragged the game down the community is getting quite dragged down and I personally cannot wait for a better game of this genre to come out and wipe out most of pubgs community due to their lack of commitment to the game and its real issues.,Not Recommended

It's a good game despite the early stage.The thing is that IS FULL OF CHEATERS and the resources allocated to cut down this bad habit are not enough. It would be easy for the developer team to buy all the cheating software avaiable and reverse it to obliterate them all. But in the end PUBG player's population is growing everyday. So basically the money income is big enough for them to forget those player who are leaving the game because of cheating.They should take example by Blizzard that in the past prosecuted legally cheat developers.,Not Recommended

Boring game got a refund. Too much time spent running around and seeing no one and when you do find someone you get killed within 2 shots. If it was more intense gameplay I'd love it I think it's a great concept but the map is just far too open to be enjoyable. The game is very glitchy too crashed multiple times in one night hopefully this is fixed for those who play the game in full release. On the plus side the graphics are very good and gameplay is varied due to differing spawn locations. I'd like to play this game but it's just not fun when you're no good at it.,Not Recommended
new update is a waste of time. ed up a lot of the biomes players liked to play in. New release also will force you to sit in a blank load in screen for about 5 10minutes while you either restart client multiple times or refresh lobby just so you can get into a game.Vehicle mechanics last patch were pretty good. cars and motorcycles were stable. This update they have ED the physics up on vehicles so they flip much more easier and they will drift and spin out at the slightest touch. most damage done to me so far in the game was from vehicle flips on randoms invisible bumps or small hills that the vehicle did not like.new map is exesively laggy and the loot overall went from alright overall to tier. Playing squads unless you get a whole CITY to yourselves count only one person getting an AR/AK with a 4x and others will be hardpressed to find even an ump or thompson. overall this release is absolute dog and bluehole should be ing fined for releasing such a unrefined untested and such a walk backwards from the games release overall.,Not Recommended

First off let me say that I used to love playing this game. It was an interesting concept and showed potential. Now what started as a fun game to play has turned into a piece of garbage. Every match is riddled with aimbots and cheating software and it's getting worse over time. The developers aren't doing enough to stop the cheating and it's ruining the game for all of the honest players. What's fun about waiting in a lobby full of obnoxious people for 1 minute for a match to start investing 30 minutes into surviving only to get shot once by an aimbot and die? Not to mention there's only two maps to play on with no way of voting on the map post match. This game needed some more work and polishing before it was released. The developers only care about the money they made from the 30 million sales though. I don't expect the community for this game to stick around much longer if they continue to show a lack of support. It's pretty much turning into another one of those early access games that makes a lot of money then dumped. I don't recommend this product I can't anymore.,Not Recommended
Don't bother buying this game until they sort the hackers out. Literally EVERY game I've played in the past 2 weeks has had a hacker and it ruins the game obviously.

Now I cant manage 40 stable good optimization progress. servers close combat is a joke and even if 60 fps+ feels like 10 max. close combat is a joke then they implement a fog map where you only have that. vehicle phisics are a joke and they randomly hit invisible walls on terain. graphics are a joke even on max (not that any system can run that) hit registration is a joke you cant hit over a fence that has 20 cm air between 2 little steel rods. parachute landing is a joke and annoys the out of me.I am not an expert in game making but if you are not either then pay someone to fix ur game.

The Game I Love to HateI cannot express how accurate the above statement exemplifies my thoughts on this game. This game can be so fun playing either solo in a duo or as a squad. I have a few good friends I've made by playing this game and we agonize and love this game on a daily basis. PROs It has that unseen 'it' factor that makes you want to keep playing it. It's similar to CS GO for me in that it's the type of game I'll play for an hour or two just to get that 'itch' out. It's the best iteration of this concept that is on the market imo. I do not enjoy Fortnite or KOTK mainly do to their gunplay mechanics. In Battlegrounds there is some base attempt at realism which I prefer.CONs Optimization and netcode Ever ran up to a corner to post knowing there is an enemy running your way in that general direction? Ever did that and somehow lag or teleport 5 feet away from said corner? While I'll admit this issue has gotten better in the months since I've owned the game microstutters and other input lag issues still occur far too often. I own a 7700k 1080Ti and 32 GB 3200 and a 960 EVO SSD my computer isn't the issue.The netcode issue is tied in with the next issue which is that the NA servers are filled up with people from every other continent other than NA. Many times their lag issues cause issues when you are trying to kill them. My internet is 300Mb/sec down and 30Mb/sec up again my computer and services are not the issue. Hacking Early on when I'd purchased this game this wasn't an issue for me. Bluehole was even taking people to court for Christ's sakes! Now I seem to be encountering hackers any time I play for an extended period (2 hours or more). I say this not to be a whiney but because I grew up playing CS and I understand how hackers work (anyone that played 1.6 knows what I'm talking about). I.E. people staring at the ground and shooting you with godlike precision from a couple hundred meters I start shooting a guy 400 meters away as he's running across a field to School and he whips around with an M16 and opens up like an M249 and every shot registers (once I'm downed the kill feed at school lights up like a xmas tree as this dude single handedly clears it or lastly me and a couple friends are driving in two separate vehicles and die within 5 seconds to the same guy all as headshots.TL DR I still play the game because I enjoy more than other games of its kind. It is most enjoyable when played with friends. Microstutters/input lag and netcode issues still common issues. NA servers are filled with everyone but NA players. Hackers are starting to become as invasive as Herpes. I'll give this game a positive rating once remedies are in place to deal with these issues most likely after full release (kill cam should help get rid of hackers). Thanks for reading.,Not Recommended

Ok I will be as forthcoming as I possibly can with this game. It WAS fun. It WAS one of the greatest games I have played in a long time until the creator decided to ignore the ever increasing flood of hackers from China and call everyone who didn't like it a bigot. Way to ruin a good game bud. Now it is next to impossible to play a single match without being instantly headshotted by a Chinese aimbotter. It's an epidemic to the point where the game is unplayable and a waste of time. REGION LOCK CHINA and stop subjecting the honest players from around the world to this absurd hoard of cheaters. It's pathetic but by all means keep announcing things that are being changed that nobody cares about while ignoring the glaring problem staring you in the face. you're allowing the game to be destroyed.

This game was nice but now it is pretty much unplayable. First of all why do bluehole not region lock China when they are joining all other server exept there own. The eu servers are like 99% chinese so fix it. The servers have been for a long time now and nothing has been done to fix this. My game is also beginning to crash with an error saying bad module And i know my friends are having the same issue. Pls fix this bluehole and i might come back and play your gameIf you thinking about buying this game for 30 bucks DONT it is not worth it as of now.,Not Recommended

This game is like a long term girlfriend. When you start off you're in that honeymoon phase where every moment is magical and you are truly enjoying yourself. As time progresses that illusion of happiness shatters and your relationship begins to have its ups and downs. You eventually find out this game is not as great as you once thought it was but you continue to play hoping that things get bettter one day. As time progresses you hit a downward spiral and start seeing other Battle Royal games and realize PUBG isn't as special as you thought it was so you take break from it. You come back a month later and realize that this game has completely changed and you are better off without it. All those sweet chicken dinners you enjoyed together were meaningless. Avoid this game at all costs do not get your heart broken.,Not Recommended

"Well. I will try to be as fair as possible. I haven't write any review so far here but I decided to do so with this game as I have never encounter such a case before.So to keep it simple the game has very nice graphics and they are combined with pretty good movement too.The gamestyle is easy plain not complicated so anyone can learn to play easily.The two maps are nice and quite large even though I'd prefer more so it doesn't feel that repetitive.There are still some glitches especially with the movement and moving with vehicles here and there but overall I am satisfied by the quality of their work.As for the gameplay. As I said it is not complicated so anyone can play it. It has several modes solo which will place you against 99 individuals duo which will place you against 49 enemy teams of 2 people each and team of 4 which is against other teams of 4 and 3 people.It can either be played in FPS or TPS modes but whatever mode you pick it means that everyone in the team is pretty much onto the same mode. Of course while of TPS you can always zoom in to FPS viewing mode at any time during the game.The difficult part comes to spotting the opponents as the map is quite big and the other hard part is targeting. Headshots are effective but difficult to achieve and even with a bit of server lag you will find it hard to shot a moving target.But up to this point all is within the enjoyable limit. I will close this review with two simple sentences that actually ruin all the above.1. I have never seen so many cheating in a game before and so unsuccessful attempts to counter hacking by a developer.Most of the time I lost my enemy achieved a headshot by having the target to clip right onto my head.2. The reward system is crap and that will make you loose interest especially when you see that they will start offering you more ""just simple appearances/clothes"" for several dollars. And even these dollars you might spend for nothing as the case that you will be opening might contain something that you already have.I do not suggest this game unless you are looking so spend 20 euros/dollars into a game that is already obsolete after 6 months of it's release. You will get angry due to cheating and bored due to the repetitive nature without an actual reward.If it was a free to play then sure I would suggest it.",Not Recommended

"I'm going to start this off by saying that I personally do enjoy this game. But there is a lot that holds this game back first and foremost the game is $30. I think it is worth the money if your looking for a ""tactical"" game but when there are many other F2P Battle Royale games that have much better payment models PUBG isn't very competitive in that sense. Not to mention they just released a season pass you have to pay $10 for that gives you a significantly better way of unlocking items. Why is this not an update for every person playing the game? It's much better than the system currently in place where you use BP to buy crates that not to mention are complete RNG on what crate you get that may or may or not REQUIRE you to buy a key in order to unlock it which the crate is also complete RNG on what you get. I understand this system being in a F2P game to an extent but there are better ways of doing this especially in a $30 game. Even Fortnite has a better system and they didn't have to pay a cent for it.We get it you want money but at least be fair and competitive. With recent events such as Bluehole trying to sue epic games for them supposedly ""infringing on copyright laws"" We all knew what that meant what they are doing is trying to get other games shut down or taken down so that they are the only one left. It's kind of ironic that the company who used the same engine bought assets directly from it's store and slightly modified some of them for their own game tries suing the company who owns said engine. Not to mention trying to get rid of other mobile Battle Royale games as soon as they put their own on IOS and Android claiming they were just copycats or clones. While that may be true for some of them take a look at your own game first you weren't the first to create a Battle Royale game there were others before you who also met success.There have been much needed improvements to this game however it's obvious where their priority lies and that's making the $$$. Their are still a plethora of issues like poor performance on lower end hardware even on better systems people still have issues. Hacking is still an issue although I havn't personally come across any. How long before these issues persist? It's been a year yet some of the biggest complaints about this game still remain in the game. Their greed and ego will be the downfall of this game take a look at your mixed and mostly negative reviews there's a reason it's there. I suggest you fix it and fix it fast or this game isn't going to survive.",Not Recommended

"The game is fun probably the best of the genre but it has one huge problem. This game needs a Ping limit all server are over populated by chinese. Dont get me wrong I don't have a problem with them I actually enjoy speaking with them when they can speak english. At this point you think im probably playing in Asian servers well no im not. Even in NA servers you are very unlikley to run into a English speaking person. I'm not saying they should be banned or region locked. If they have NA friends theu should be able to join them as long as they meet the ping limit. Please note PlayerUnknown's creaters we are not being ""Racist"" we just want a game that is fair for everyone and excessive ping is not helping! At this time I do not recomment this game and this troubles me because I love the game so much! However after something is done with the servers I will change that!",Not Recommended

I hate to see it coming to this... I used to love this game as a chill game to play by myself or with friends but in later months it has just become annoying.Even if you overlook the crappy optimization (which seems to have gotten worse?!) the game is now turning in to a playground for cheaters and hosts a generally unfriendly community. Controls bug out (litterally spamming F to pick up stuff at this point) and Collision with vehicles is a lottery where the prises are Congrats your vehicle crahsed normally and took some damage Oh gosh your vehicle clipped through the object and takes damage/ stops in the middle of nowhere. Nope im out vehicle was flung into the air and is now doing summersaults. don't worry it will land soon enough and explode as you sit there wide eyed and wondering what the hell happened.At it's current state i would not personally buy it again. I would wait until the major flaws have been adressed and in the meantime get into the BR gaming mood from other sources.,Not Recommended

I do enjoy playing this game with friends but playing it by yourself is a completely different story. The amount of chineese players that will teamkill you if you do not speak chineese outnumbers the amount of North Americans on the NA (North American) servers that speak english. This makes getting a random group for squad impossible in matchmaking. The vehicle mechanics are broken and the weapon variety is small. Before the game starts all your hear is asians yelling in their native tongue at the top of their lungs and other asian players in an internet cafe with their mics always on thus allowing you to not only hear that asian yelling in his native tongue but all of the other asians in that cafe doing the same.... at video games...... as grown adults......All in all if the vehicle mechanics were fixed more weapon variety was added and there was a region lock the game would be great but from what I have read bluehole has no intention of stopping the invasion onto other servers.,Not Recommended

I would like to give this game positive feedback as it is a good game in many ways.

"I used to love playing this game however here's the deal...Time and time agian the developers of this game have without fail proven their inability to properly maintain a modern multiplayer game. The first time I noticed this was when they threw a tournament despite the game being horibly broken and having major issues with lag and such. Yet the 2 weeks after this tournament the team takes time off to ""celebrate their accomplishments."" Fastforward to now the game still has major lag and gameplay mechanical issues the developers focus more on loot crates (for which keys are purchased through microtransactions) for a random chance at skins! Above all of this this game is payed as opossed to its competitor Fortnite and still manages to not perform as well.",Not Recommended

*A lot of people might hate on me as I've only had about a hundred hours so far but I think that if a player had a great time playing a game for a few hours they should be coming back because of their enjoyment.* *I am also not good at English so please bare my gramatical mistakes if there are any*I was really skeptical about this game when it was first out on Steam. I didn't like the idea of having another early access game with a slight open world feeling to it. Well more than 2 million people obviously didn't agree with me. Despite it's popularity I wouldn't advise buying this game until a few months AFTER its official release Here are my reasons why 1. In my experience the servers' performance is somewhat poor recently. This probably isn't a problem on all servers though but I've experienced much server issues to the point where it has caused me to be very frustrated with this game. (Don't even get me started on those times where I constantly tried to even get to the main menu because of the login issues)2. I haven't encountered too many hackers but I've been through a few (about 3 so far). With many people saying that there are numerous hackers swarming around I don't think developers would be able to resolve the issue by the time this game actually releases (props to this game coming out of Early Access soon though). But I believe that they'd be able to resolve the issue although probably numerous months after the release. I understand that there will be always hackers in ever so popular games but having a large percentage of them around ruins the experience for the community. 3. While this game is being updated with new content (don't get me wrong this is a good thing to keep games alive) this game seriously needs to be somewhat optimized for PCs even on beefy computers. I would much prefer it if there was AT LEAST one major update that would fix the performance issues this game has (and the numerous bugs infested as well) instead of giving a very large focus on adding new content every update. Getting back I play on low medium settings and I still get many instances where my FPS would drop to really low numbers oh and stuttering (lots of it). I have a decent system and I don't think I should be getting this kind of issue at least not very often. For my final words I still believe this game can survive. Despite all the points I mentioned I still somewhat enjoy the game especially with friends. The thing that drives me away are the problems currently floating around. Bluehole has a very very good game with lots of potential in their hands at the moment but if they drive it to the wrong turn the opportunity will slowly cripple down to the trash. Oh and uh please please please stop making this game into an Esport and let people have fun with it and not turn it into something like CS GO. Also this game isn't even Esports ready c'mon it hasn't even come out of Early Access.,Not Recommended
