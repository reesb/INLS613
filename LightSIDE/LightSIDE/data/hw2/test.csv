 I do not know what today's movie goers expect but after 68 years of movie watching.. (Well maybe I didn't watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years so make that 58 years of movie watching) I expect to be entertained not bored to tears assaulted by continuous profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in with no other purpose in mind but to show blood splattering and body parts being mangled. Surveillance is one of those movies that was made by people who have NO imagination little if any talent a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable trait of letting a scene go on and on long after the purpose for it has elapsed. That anyone would ever think that this was a worthwhile movie when it is nothing more that Hollywood garbage is beyond me. As a combat veteran I have seen violence blood and gore in many forms and movies like We were soldiers is about as violent as a movie can get but it has redeeming value. Surveillance must have been dreamed up by persons in a drug induced stupor with no writing ability no directorial training no experience in film editing and a total lack of contact with reality. Just a stupid movie of two serial killers posing as FBI agents setting up a scenario to kill some stupid foul mouth cops etc.. A high priced piece of garbage that only an idiot could like... ,neg
 The films' producers are hoping that Cameron Diaz' name will help sell this picture. Unfortunately nothing can save what has already been captured on the screen. Despite some beautifully shot European locations and some solid production design elements the film fails mostly due to its awkward unbelievable romance between Brewster and Eccleston. An unplesasant filmgoing experience. ,neg
 At first sight I must say already watch The Contractor 2007. With Wesley Snipes too. A better action movie and with a more dramatic plot. The Detonator has an horrendous plot focusing in some sort of atomic bomb set in Romania and with awful directing for an action movie-- there is no thrilling moments and an action movie is turned in to boredom. Really what you expect Wesley Snipes to do when awful screenplays like this one are offered to him? Don't blame him he needs the money. This was the first impression when I saw the movie 3 years ago. But I won't see it again no way. Screw it. It sucks. There. I said it. PS: I don't think I ever said this movie sucks on a IMDb review. Thank you Detonator! ,neg
 Just listen to the Broadway cast album and to the voices of Barbara Harris and John Cullum who do wonders for the wonderful Lerner and Lane score. Then with that beautiful cast recording fresh in mind watch the movie with Streisand as Streisand and Yves Montand reading his lines with such a heavy French accent that a chain saw couldn't cut through it. The best part (for those who need something to look forward to) is what Montand does to the introductory part of the title song. Listen as he sings/says: Could anyone among us have an inkling or a clue what magic feats of wizardry and voodoo you can do? (That one part sums up the problem that results from casting name stars in movie musicals instead of the appropriate talent for the various roles.) I can just see Rex Harrison entering that scene and suggesting Montand too could learn to do justice to the beauty of the English language. ,neg
 Brainy cross-dressing little boy finds success on the Spelling Bee circuit despite an unconventional and dysfunctional upbringing. Shirley MacLaine directed and stars as the child's grandmother and it is always fascinating to see long-time actors getting their chance at directing a film the material that they're drawn to and the actors they choose to work with. Here the only person well-cast in Bruno is MacLaine. The child actors seem to have been picked for their twinkle and cuteness and squishy-hearted MacLaine holds their close-ups for excruciatingly long periods; nothing about these cherubs seems natural not the lines that fall without consciousness out of their mouths or the interaction they have with adults or even each other. As the boy's disgruntled father poor Gary Sinise hovers around the edges in mock shame always with a pained look on his face. Towards the end of the film MacLaine turns the whole thing into a passel of hugging scenes and even concludes with the kid hugging the Pope in Rome! Another ungodly treatise from a talented actress-turned-director who much like Sally Field and her film Beautiful cannot seem to stop winking at and nudging the audience. Shirley uses ethnicity for shtick and childhood innocence as a punchline. The children in this cast roll their eyes crack wise with mature comments use big words--but when one mealy-mouthed boy calls our pint-sized hero gay MacLaine's granny instructs him to go over and punch the kid out (in front the media!). How's that for progression? * from **** ,neg
 How dare you? Adam Low without apparent shame puts his name to this fake tribute. It's not even a serious study or analysis or commentary of the great Visconti's work. Yes it's long and portentous yes we do have some wonderful clips from the films that most people interested on the subject have already seen. But what resounds the longest leaving the most lasting impression is the gossip. The last and loudest voice comes from a third rate German actor ranting and raving. The appropriately named Mr.Low directed this hoping I imagine to get better ratings than his previous more to the point but deadly boring documentary on Kurosawa. Well I have news for you Mr Low and your cohorts. You missed a great opportunity and I for one won't give you another. ,neg
 The Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes. Set in Bengal in the early 1900's the film (based on Tagore's novel) draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women. An educated and beautiful woman Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society. The film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of her depth in portraying Binodini's strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness. Binodini's idealism does not come across and as a result the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried. ,pos
 After some further thought about this film I find it's far too easy to dismiss this as the Boy's dream. I have actually received some spiritual strength from Northfork.......Angels do exist....we definitely are entertained by Angels....most of the time we aren't even aware of it..... At a point of spiritual and emotional turbidity in my life I personally really needed this film. Yes as I wrote before it speaks to so many......can't wait to get to Heaven... Being so sick of all of the FX and Formula stuff I found this film to be genuine Cinema. All I can say is it touched me in so many ways that I still am sorting it all out. North Fork is a wonderful film. One that brings the viewer's mind out of the gutter and into the heart. The spiritual aspect is so very intriguing to me. Pay attention as you'll need to use the brain and heart God gave you to follow the story. I think it's possibly a bit over the heads of some but I feel those are the individuals it speaks to most importantly. I want to view it several more times just so I can take it all in! The Industry needs to study this film to realize we do exist. My thanks to all involved in the making of this film.  ,pos
 I was a junior in high school when Flesh hit the big screens but had the good fortune to see it at midnight movie houses in NYC just two years later. Flesh is the first part of a so-called trilogy of films featuring Joe Dallesandro as an object of desire. It bears the Warhol name but is more the work of Paul Morissey. Essentially the story concerns itself with the exploits surrounding one day in the life of a street-wise male hustler (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is young beautiful and a bit naive... but he manages to bring home the bacon to his wife for reasons which should not be explained to appreciate the film fully. Of special note to film buffs is that this film (along with the remaining two of the trilogy) had no script per se. Warhol's superstars were given simply a premise... and the words and actions which the viewer sees are quite natural (even at times ridiculous or non-sensical). But all in all it works... Rolling Stone noted in its review that the film was better than Midnight Cowboy a film of the same year more polished by Hollywood (An Academy Award winner for Best Film) with big name talent (I equally admire the film)... but FLESH being improvised was somehow more gut wrenching and realistic without the need for complex sub-plots and any cause de celebre .. or for that matter any cause at all! The film grossed more than $3 million dollars and was an absolute sensation particularly in the German market (which ironically thought they were given a censored version of the film because of the post-editing....see note below). Curiously the film is very much cut and paste with pops . clicks flashes and dialogue literally cut off mid-sentence. It is almost as if Warhol/Morissey are stating a simple truth that it is a day in the life of a superstar snippets for your voyeuristic tendencies. Far better than earlier Warhol works of 8 hours of sleeping and the statue of liberty as a 20+ hour movie. FLESH in my opinion is the first of the Warhol films that actually is digestible (given a wide pallette) and Warhol's/the Factory's first legitimate response to the Hollywood phenomenon of stardom . As the first of a trilogy it portrays a young desirable male icon naive sought after responding to invitations to please his family. Subsequent films would show the same character with a differing set of values. (See Trash and Heat ) ,pos
 And I do. Peter Falk has created a role that will live on forever in TV land! And I'm grateful for that. This isn't one of his finest hours though. Columbo goes to college and basically teaches how he solves a crime and yet there are bad guys who go ahead and think they're smarter than he is. What all us fans know is that Columbo needs a worthy opponent. Without a great enemy how can he be the hero in the wrinkled coat? Still it's better than NO Columbo and I'll wait and watch the next one as well. ,pos
 Okay... she's on the boat with this guy realizes he's out to kill her knocks him out and then finds the reason he's out to off her is this disk that got her coworker killed. So what would any rational person do? Maybe conk him over the head again to make sure he's really out?? Tie him up?? Look Sandra honey you've got the chance to escape while the guy is out for only so long. Until you know how long it will take you take you to escape make sure he's not able to come after you. I HATE these stupid female victim roles. The rest of the movie was just a series of twists and turns that were completely convoluted and too unbelievable to remain interesting. ,neg
 Engaging entry from Europe about Czech fighter pilots flying for the RAF during WW2. It's always interesting as an American to see a new point of view on familiar events in history. There's nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which this is filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative. Still it is compelling all the way through. There is a good balance between drama romance humor action and symbolism that is understated beautifully by the director and cast. This is a breath of fresh air after sitting through overblown and boring Hollywood epics like Pearl Harbor. A solid production all around. This is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign cinema. ,pos
 Maybe this movie was actually intended to be satire like 'Airplane' but it failed at that as miserably as it failed at being a 'thriller'. I don't understand why they couldn't have paid an actual pilot a couple hundred bucks for a little technical advice. Hell I would have done it for free! This magical aircraft managed to morph from a 757 to a 767 to a 747 in an hour and the power levers worked backward. And the dialog sounds like it came out the back end of a kid's game of 'telephone' where everyone spoke different languages. I actually rewound the TIVO and watched some of it a second time to see if it was really as bad as I thought at first. It was. ,neg
 Once again Elmer is faced with the dilemma of who to shoot. Bugs of Daffy. He's unsure of what season it is and Bunny and Duck arguing help matters not. Though Bugs proves he's the smartest once more by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when that runs out he does his trademark cross-dressing thingy. Daffy freaks out and demands the bunny be shot. Though Elmer is too stupid he is hopelessly in love with the girl bunny thing. Elmer really is to blame for all this. If he weren't so dumb he'd know it REALLY is duck season and just blast Daffy. But poor old Daff can't believe the utter preposterousness of the situation. His cruel plans of misdirection have been foiled by Elmer's dumbness. Daffy is so shocked that he even goes home with Elmer to be blasted in his living room. Poor Daff. He rules! ,pos
 Hope Floats with Sandra Bullock is a real disappointment. The story starts off ok. Her husband cheats on her and she finds out on national television. So she has to rebuild her life. Here it could have gotten interesting or built up in a story line but you become so bored with it. She moves back with her parents and Harry Connick Jr. who plays Justin begins hitting on her. The two have no real chemistry at all yet your supposed to get the impression that Justin is in love with her. The movie ends the way you figure it will but you wish it hadn't ended like every other kind like it. They had a good start with this movie and could have turned it into something watchable but instead its a movie that you definitely want to miss. ,neg
 Inarguably one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years Werner Herzog has been pushing the boundaries of cinema perhaps more so than any other commercial filmmaker. I've been acquainted with Herzog for a few decades now and I've never not been impressed by both the man and his work. Last year I went to see Rescue Dawn and was somewhat surprised at how relatively mainstream the film was yet couldn't help but imagine Herzog taking his actors and crew into the actual jungle to not only make the film but to live it. No other filmmaker is as crazed about the purity of the film-making process and the subsequent lore from such productions as Fitzcarraldo has been forged into cinematic legend. Today I sat down to Fata Morgana a 1969 Herzog film that could be described as an allegorical filmic postcard. Without researching the actual locations I'm assuming it was shot somewhere in Africa both coastal and desert a region that could have once been the cradle of infant man infant civilization infant life on earth. It is these origins the biblical notion of the Garden of Eden and the Apocalypse that Herzog is concerned with as is voiced by the narration dispensed throughout the 79 minute run time. Watching FM I couldn't help but feel I was a passenger on a profound journey. In the opening sequence the title is translated as Mirage and Herzog juxtaposes this translation with multiple repetitions of commercial jets landing on an airstrip. These images are perverted their 3-dimensionality crushed flat by a long lens piling layers of exhaust heat waves and light aberrations all on top of one another. The effect left me to conclude: things are not as they seem. FM is divided into 3 very distinct chapters: 1) Creation 2) Paradise and 3) The Golden Age. Chapter One opens with countless languid images where bleak barren landscapes scroll by dead animals rot broken shells of crashed airplanes and abandoned cars slowly disintegrate in the desert sun. The people populating this inhospitable landscape are ragged unsmiling and apparent prisoners of the desert. The narration talks of a time before life a time where the canvas of earth was blank and all that existed were the heavens. While the narration hearkens to a simpler purer era a portrait of a young boy holding a fox-like animal by its throat evokes a chilling depiction of man's cruel ruthless attempt to enforce a dominion over nature. In the next chapter we are introduced to more of the same yet the images and people are more animated and seem infused with a modicum of life and vitality. We listen to a goggled biologist talk about the difficultly a monitor lizard has hunting for prey in such a lifeless environment. As he holds the squirming monitor its tongue flicking at flies he also describes how difficult it to capture these creatures in the searing 140 degree heat. The parallel is duly noted and Herzog continues to explore this concept through repeated candid portraits of individuals battered by the sun the desert and the laborious efforts required to exist in this harsh realm. He also pushes forward the theme that if not in control man asserts his control over his environment and not always in the most pleasant of ways. The last chapter takes us out of the desert's blast furnace and into the more familiar Herzog territory populated by eccentrics and absurd behavior. No one seems to have a more effective symbiotic relationship with the oddballs of the world than Herzog -- possibly this is where he feels most at home. Much like Errol Morris Herzog chooses to place his camera in as seemingly objective a position as he can before he lets the film roll. The subsequent flirtation Herzog has with his subject is the result of him being able to continue shooting well beyond the point when most directors would have yelled cut. As Morris does this extended roll pushes past the on moment the subjects feel obliged to offer and through their discomfort of being pushed into overtime their facade gives way to something real. The most humorous portrait in this chapter is of the 2 person band playing an odd polka-like song that Herzog recycles throughout this chapter. The drummer of the band wears the same goggles as the biologist as does another guy doing a magic trick begging the question: what's with the goggles? They definitely add some levity to the film but one has to wonder if they hold any deeper meaning or significance or is this just another example of Herzog's playfullness. The narration aside Herzog utilizes folk and blues music as the experimental documentary's soundtrack. Leonard Cohen grabs the most screen time two of his beautifully melancholic songs So Long Marianne and Suzanne. perfectly accompany the scrolling landscapes adding to the convincing feel that we are truly along for the ride. By the end of the journey Herzog comes back to one of the many shots that recur throughout the film: the distant framing of a lone vehicle traversing the endless desert engulfed by a water mirage that fills the horizon. Despite the overall bleakness of FM the crescendo of the film and the mirage motif leave you with a hopeful spirit belief that against all odds life will persevere and possibly even flourish. Having finished writing this post I referenced FM to discover that Herzog shot it in Saharan Cameroon only weeks after a bloody coup. True to his legend Herzog and his crew were arrested beaten and imprisoned. While imprisoned Herzog fell ill with Schistosomiasis a blood parasite. It's truly hard not to love such a hypnotic and austere film as Fata Morgana; knowing the filmmaker was willing to die to get it made only makes you respect it all the more. http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/ ,pos
 Not for those adrenaline maniacs etc It's a good movie looking at after war psychical problem from the other point of view. Emilio Estevez is great as a young man haunted by the demons of Vietnam war causing problem in family. Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father. It all comes down to the problem how to deal with the past with whom Emilion Estevez's character can't seem to deal and Martin Sheen's character don't want do deal with. Protective mother looks at this problem with warm and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons. ,pos
 In watching this off and on for a few seasons two things come to mind: One - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae. I tried to be a fan because I liked the idea of this reality show competition. No other famous model thought of this and it is very admirable for Tyra Banks to do so. But as the series goes on and on I've come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. Women shouldn't watch this teens should stay clear of it unless they're doing book reports on the subject. Many women try out for slots to compete for Americas Next Top Model . They live together cat fight together cry together get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim You will see me again . Heck I'm trying to see what happened to the ones that DID win actually. This is the dream of some girls and good for them. In watching this I hope the other girls that see this and run like Hades the other way - like to college. I just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group. That even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks. The full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what I think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose - so of course that would make them look even fatter - a ploy fashionatas use all the time. Bad bad Tyra and crew. But to be fair Americas Next Top Model is not about full figured models it's about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. Hence the name of the show. Hence the sorry lot of judges photographers associations. Hence Tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get. But then again that IS the one thing I like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldn't have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors. But after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program. ,neg
 Directed by a veteran Hollywood director Henry King who began his career still in 1915 Love is a Many Splendored Thing was one of his last great films. It was based on a bestseller by Han Suyin called simply A Many Splendored Thing the phrase that was borrowed by the author from the poem The Kingdom of God by Francis Thompson where that many splendored word `love' was used in quite a different and rather transcendental context meaning the love of God. Made in the 50s the film marked along with works by such directors as Douglas Sirk and Vincente Minnelli a sort of renascence of melodrama its florescence and reaching yet again a peak of popularity. The story begins when a handsome American reporter Mark Elliott played by William Holden yet once again typecast in one of his irresistible `playboy' roles comes to the Hong Kong and meets there a young and pretty Han Suyin (Jennifer Jones) of half-Chinese half-English origin who is working as a doctor at a hospital and whose husband was recently killed by the Chinese communists. Instantly Mark feels a rather strong attraction towards her but at the beginning his deep feelings are not quite reciprocated by Han's heart left cold after the death of her husband (`I believe in human heart now only as a doctor'). But very soon she yields to the persistent courting of tempting as hell Mark and both of them enter a passionate relationship apparently stoppable by nothing even by the fact that Mark is unhappily married and his wife doesn't want to give him a divorce or social differences and prejudices caused by Han's Chinese origin. But still it's the fate that has a final word to say in determining the fairness of the eternalness of such a blissful loving relationship for no matter how enduring the two assume it to be the merciless time is waiting in a rather alarming form of death prepared at any given moment to prove its impermanence. Undoubtedly one of the most romantic films ever made Love is a Many Splendored Thing features fine performances from William Holden and Jennifer Jones wonderful Academy Award winning musical score by Alfred Newman and extremely romantic touching heart-warming but ultimately heart-breaking story. Don't miss that many splendored film. 8/10 ,pos
 Having worked professionally with young girls on the run I found this film surprisingly authentic. I would never have found it had a friend not loaned his videotape. There are classic themes here: Coming of Age Mother/Daughter Estrangement The Limited Choices of the Underprivileged Who is the Good Samaritan Tragedy is in Every Life & the many layers or relationships. Flashbacks are meaningful (when Alice acquires a gun we know she has some familiarity with how to use it) and it does not end in cliché. The cast really sells their roles. It is adult material and the audio is a bit too grainy. Allow it 15 minutes to so to draw you in. ,pos
 There's something going on in this film directed by X-Files scribe John Shiban that has eluded me. You get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems yet I feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward. It's about perception. There are characters the heroine Nicole(Jaimie Alexander)meets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish. This might seem like a spoiler but it's something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers' part. They seem to be poking fun at us as we watch curious at whether we should trust what Nicole is seeing or not. It never gets a proper answer and I for one was a bit clueless at the point. There comes a time in a film when ambiguity can just be frustrating because the viewer is led on a wild goose chase that ends at a dead end with little explanation at what we just saw..it ultimately feels like an exhausting exercise instead of a thrilling psycho-drama. Now there's nothing wrong with ambiguity itself but give us something to latch onto or you will evade us. That's how I felt as I watched Rest Stop. This film is supposedly about a young woman named Nicole who decides to run off to California with lover Jesse(Joey Mendicino)to make it big in Hollywood. They make what is supposed to be a slight detour at a rest stop so that Nicole can pee but it descends into terror for her when she finds that her Jesse is completely missing. Someone in a crusty dusty yellow truck is a nut job who seems to be causing a lot of trouble to Nicole and we soon realize that he is behind Jesse's disappearance when things start to occur signs provided to her if you will she will have to find a way out of a very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing town and with limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who provides her with some strong evidence of how evil he can be. That's the easy part. When a female character comes into play the film makes a really bizarre leap from logic as we are not sure where she ever came from how she got there and more importantly where she goes once Nicole tries to break her free from her supposed prison in the restroom's utilities' cabinet. She meets another a Police officer in the area(Joey Lawrence) who might seem like her savior but when he too is a victim of the truck driver startling things occur again that questions if he was ever actually even there to begin with. The truck driver commits torturous acts to Nicole(like holing her up in the restroom and as she tries to untie a wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock she receives a nasty bite from him). He then sets fire to the restroom leaving her without a lasting place of refuge from the beast. It's the timing of the truck driver's attacks that has me listless. Perhaps he just likes tormenting her but he appropriately appears in certain situations where Nicole has time to flee or prepare. It doesn't make much sense his motives which propel the film into an illogical idea. Why does he make himself so obvious? Why does he allow her to prepare? It seems I'm going out on a limb here that he likes having his quarry believe they can find a way of escape only to stomp that hope out when he comes up with his next grisly attack. Yet why does Shiban decide to play with the viewer by having Nicole experience odd meetings with people that don't exist? What is Shiban and the writing team trying to say? And to cap off the film's unhinged weirdness is a family in a RV. They play a small part in the scheme of things as religious bigots themselves but the film doesn't do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film at all. ,neg
 What annoys me with so called 'science' programs such as these is that it is presented as if it were a FACT that dinosaurs live 'millions' of years ago. Firstly nobody can even conduct a scientific experiment to prove that the earth is millions/billions of years old. It's a shallow theory based on inaccurate radiometric dating methods with huge assumptions thrown into the evolutionary pot. Secondly nobody can prove that evolution ever happened. All Darwin's missing links are still MISSING ! If you look at all the fossils anywhere in or on the earth they are complete animals of a certain kind eg: a dog or a cat. Nobody has ever found the skeleton of a dog turning into a cat or in the example presented in this series a dinosaur turning into a bird. This is utter hogwash. There's more proof that Santa Claus exists than any animal changing into another kind of animal. All the ideas presented in this series is an attempt to eliminate the idea that the universe and the everything in it was created. This series is NOT SCIENCE. It is a religious world view that hides under the banner of science. Science is something we can observe and repeat. What you are seeing here is SCIENCE FICTION. If you want to watch a science fiction program that has the decency to admit that it's a science fiction program then rather watch Star Trek or Star Wars. ,neg
 I saw the world premiere at the Toronto International Film Fest this is a great film. Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star as Charles and Emma Darwin in the midst of their struggle through the writing of and decision to publish Origin of Species . Their consideration of the ramifications it may have for their family and the future of humankind are conveyed in such a manner that one suspects only an off-screen couple could achieve. Jon Amiel (who gave a heart-felt introduction) and John Collee do and excellent job of bringing Randal Keynes' biography to life. They created some very poignant and human moments great cinematography and sets and a generous helping of tongue-in-cheek about the still divisive theory of evolution. The surprise star is Martha West who plays Annie Darwin the character around whom much of the story unfurls. She plays the precocious young girl to a tee. If this performance is anything to go by her star should be on the rise. All in all a great film and although it is a period drama the issues that drive it are still very much alive today. ,pos
 I never saw Doctor Who before (at least not in any focused way) so I was new to the concept. I have to say that the new show works very well. It's funny (it really also ought to say Comedy in the genre description; many plot turns are only acceptable because of their comedic value) it's well-written and it's making a meager budget go a long way. The human dimension is very strong and engaging which is very rare in current TV shows. I've seen the first eight episodes and #6-8 were my favorites so far. Even types of stories that are all too easy to screw up (with time-travel saving one's dead parents and that sort of stuff) works out amazingly well here. Christopher Eccleston is a joy to watch as the witty and light-hearted though occasionally morose Doctor - if they can find a good replacement for him I'll be quite surprised. But I'm willing to give the new guy a chance. There's little doubt however that the Eccleston episodes are going to go down in history as classics. The relationship between the Doctor and Rose is particularly refreshing. The Doc is much more of a father figure to her than a romantic interest and yet there are hints of romantic innuendo between them which however is much more emotional and human than sexual. A good show. The biggest drawback is the low budget - a show like this ought to have better special effects. And why they don't simply use some cheaper effects I don't know. In this day and age SFX don't have to cost a bundle - just look at the Star Wars: Revelations fan film. 8 out of 10. ,pos
 *****Spoiler Ahead***** I suppose that you shouldn't expect much of a made for TV movie but this one was especially bad the plot was a good idea but badly done the acting wasn't especially good. And the ending of the film was just terrible. The main character was perfectly normal all the way through the film and then suddenly when we find out that she was the killer she just turns into a mentally challenged psychopath. It's completely pathetic. There is only one reason really to watch this film Yasmin Bleeth although haven't we all seen her in a swimsuit before ? Don't bother even watching this waste of time if you want a film about the world of beauty contest then watch Drop Dead Gorgeous instead it's only an infinite number of times better. ,neg
 Based on a Stephen King novel NEEDFUL THINGS provides the intrigue and eeriness to keep you in your seat. A mysterious man(Max von Sydow) comes to town and soon becomes the most talked about citizen. Could it be that the devil himself has set up shop as an antique dealer in a small town in Maine? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. Also starring are Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is steady and Bedelia is deserving of your attention. Also in support are J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. Not the best nor the worst adaptation of King's horror on the screen. ,neg
 House of the Damned (also known as Spectre ) is one of your low budget haunted house horror flicks filled with mediocre performances and cheap effects. It is about a family that inherits an old Irish mansion and after moving in begin to experience strange phenomenon and ghostly apparitions including the ghost of a young girl who was murdered and buried within a wall in the mansion's basement. The couple's young daughter is then whisked away into some other dimension and they seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help. The ideas this film borrowed from the 1982 haunted house film Poltergeist are obvious. I will say that this movie does have some slightly creepy sequences but it is sometimes very very boring. The acting here is nothing special the mood is alright the score (which was mostly this dramatic Irish opera music) was somewhat annoying and the CGI special effects are really horrible. I mean it was 1996 you would think they could have done a little better than they did. The ending where the house was on fire was the poorest special effect I've seen very very cheap. But hey this was a cheap movie. Also the translucent monster wolf thing that their daughter sees looks horribly fake. And what was it's significance in the film anyway? What the heck does a wolf-monster have to do with a haunted house? The special effects in here are what really ruined this movie. The acting was pretty bad too. I usually enjoy many low budget horror films but not this one. House of the Damned is nothing special at all only consider watching it if you have nothing better to do. But you'll probably want to pass on it. 4/10. ,neg
 Me being from Australia and loving the series I wasn't expecting much from the American version of Kath and Kim but I thought I'd watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad. Well whats there to say. Its nothing special.Selma Blair is OK as Kim and actually had a few good lines Molly Shannon is not a good Kath though. The good thing about Jane Turner's Kath is that when she speaks with all her funny accents (such as when she says Yumor or Noice) it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks but when Shannon has a go at the accent its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And the show really misses Sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about because the Kal and Craig characters in this version are really not funny. So far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the Aussie version although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name not being compared to the Aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better. But if there is nothing else to do on a Sunday night (or Thursday night in America) then you cant do much harm in watching it or better put on some of the Aussie version if you've got it. ,neg
 My wife and I find this movie to be a wonderful pick-me-up when we need to have a good laugh - the conflict between some characters and the repore between others make this a sure fire comedy relief. I am so looking forward to this movie coming on DVD so I can replace my well watched VHS. ,pos
 This movie sucked sooo bad I couldn't even watch the ending. Milo's voice was too low and I couldn't understand what he said as well as some of Kendra's lines. Also where did he get all these wedding dresses from; it was very impractical. The movie failed to elaborate on Milo's drowning and how it made people ridicule Dr. Jeter and his practice. Overall I was disappointed that I was unable to give this movie a rating of zero because by grading this movie as a one I felt I was giving it undeserved praise. ,neg
 I enjoyed this show it was on in the uk but not at peak time and they seemed to move it all over the schedules so I wasn't able to watch them all. I was surprised when it didn't return and had no i idea why still don't know but i guess that's not important. Great performances from the two leads they were very believable as friends. The two supporting actresses also added well to the mix. I guess it was part of a whole load of shows that were lifestyle centred Friends being the obvious main one but sex in the city came along a few years later. The characters get take out coffee they drink at nice bars that sort of thing a little woody allenish in a way. ,pos
 Having discovered the Ring trilogy I have been greedily gobbling up all those other Japanese and Korean films that are either on or following the bandwagon. I don't have an easy definition of horror but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons even though I can't claim that the film makes a lot of sense. I'm squeamish so there were several points in the film when I just didn't want to watch what was happening on screen. The film unnerved me so I became apprehensive of seeing things that I thought I was going to see. It's an imaginative film offering a great deal visually. It also provides food for thought. And plenty of material to argue about when the film is over. The characters are well-defined to say the least. Could they make films like this in the West? So it doesn't make sense in the end but when one has an appetite for the occult the supernatural the bizarre the otherworldly then no film is going to deliver a final all-explaining pay-off. ,pos
 I want the 99 minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie. The acting was horrific! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I will never look at them the same again. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not a surprise. Everyone knows they never could act. Thankfully only Dan attempted an accent. His accent was a disaster as expected. I think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from Minnesota. I hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time. The only reason I was able to sit through the whole movie was because I was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read. ,neg
 me and a coupla friends form university - alberto lopez dave hall celina alcock (we graduated from uea norwich uk in 1997) still get together and watch b-movies once a month. We are consummate experts in the art of bad movie-making and this film was quickly placed in the top 10 of awful/brilliant movies. so if you've just got the beers and weed in and need a film to laugh like a drain at DROID GUNNER aka PHOENIX 2 is the film for you! Marc Singer is totally aware he's in a turkey of a film here and milks it for everything he can! Matthius Hues is sublime in his wooden acting and musclebound moronity (is that a word??) as he grunts But I want my 20 thousand! Pure Shlock Gold! If you liked this also see: TRANCERS THE RUNESTONE DOLLMAN and anything by Charles Band or Fred Olen Ray.....(but be warned: some of their films are completely and utterly without merit and you'll be screaming for those lost hours of your life!!!?!). ,pos
 It came before the ten commandments land of the Pharaohs Ben Hur and it's overlooked today.How unfair!Based on Mika Waltari's mammoth novel it doesn't cheapen it!Waltari's novel was so huge only a miniseries could have done it justice (I hope it will be done some day).Waltari whose message is essentially Christian remains intact(another of his books the secret of the kingdom (first part) takes place after Christ's death in the Holy Land). The Egyptian is the rising of a monotheism close to Christianism long before Christ:the Pharaoh(Wilding) is some kind of Messiah who sacrifices his life because he knows that the true kingdom is not in the material world:he asks to return good for evil!And he has disciples who will eventually turn into martyrs (the scene when Simmons and the other worshippers of the Sun God are slain is visually stunning looking like some pagan ballet).For the priests on the other hand this new religion would mean the end of their influence on the populace and that's why they look for a strong man (Mature)who can lead the army against the Hittites as well as against their dangerous compatriots.Another religion or non-religion should we say is Sinouhé's (Purdom)who during two hours believes in nothing (the sequence of the grain of sands is absolutely sensational and rises the whole movie well above the average peplum !!) There's another fascinating side:the movie looks like a flamboyant melodrama.Not only for the screenplay (notably pharoah's sister's (Tierney)final revelation which predates the ten commandments by two years) but also the splendor of the cinematography:Viviani in his book about Curtiz talks about a Baudelairian atmosphere blue and gold notably in the scenes which involve the prostitute (Darvi)who contemplates her reflection in the water of her bath supreme narcissism. Around the hero all the characters appear disappear appear again but when they reappear they have followed their way and all the subplots come together with consummate skill.Besides as such is often the case in modern melodramas the story is a long flashback framed by two short sequences showing Sinouhé an old man who's remembering. This is a wonderful sword and sandals that had a strong influence not only in America but also in Europa notably in Poland where Jerzy Kawalerowicz directed a spellbinding faraon (1966) which owed a lot to Curtiz. ,pos
 I thought this movie was great if you didn't take it too seriously. Just sit back and enjoy Hilary Swank in all her greatness and laugh when the monks go to Boston MA. I also think this movie has a great message about self control and inner strength. Plus Mr. Myagi was so sweet I wish he'd teach me karate! ,pos
 I went into this film thinking I wasn't going to like it but hoping to be surprised but this much like the film ended up being bleak and hopeless. But don't get me wrong Minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion. The acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for Law Kidman and Zellweger even though Portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film. The locations are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot. However for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to Minghella and his adaptation. The film is so utterly bleak it makes for what I consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film I didn't have the time to emotionally invest or hadn't recovered from a previous blow and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care not to mention predictable. Overall the Cold Mountain almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film as all I remember is death which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters. ,pos
 The Kid is a really good family movie about a stuffy image consultant Russ Duritz who has lots of money a good job nice house etc. The only problem is he doesn't have much of a social life as nobody seems to like him as he isn't always very nice. One day though things are about to change when an eight year old version of himself magically appears. This gives Russ a second chance to make things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead role here and he gives a really good performance. The Kid is a nice heart-warming movie for everyone. ,pos
 The Falcon and the Snowman is the story of two young men a CIA employee and a drug dealer who become disenchanted with United States foreign policy and sell state secrets to the Soviet Union. The events of the film are based on a true story. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in the lead parts and develop interesting characterizations. The supporting cast also performs well notably with a performance from David Suchet of Hercule Poirot fame as a seasoned Soviet agent. The film is generally effective at setting out its premise and developing it and giving a sense of two boys caught in something they did not properly understand going in. However it does seem overlong and cumbersome at points in the middle. The ending however is tense stunning and effective. There are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack but also unfortunately a repeated mellow synthesizer track that doesn't fit with a spy story. There are other spy films more worth seeking out than The Falcon and the Snowman but it is a decent film none the less. ,pos
 A fine performance by Vittorio Mezzogiorno and a masterful one by Jean-Hugues Anglade adorn this stange tale of lust desire and alienation in France. The work of the two lead performers is striking--subtle intense and passionate. Alas the script is deliberately turgid and sordid and the overall effect leaves one with a downcast spirit. Still those who can appreciate fine quality acting will be able to savor the courageous work of the leads in this often difficult film journey of Gallic low life. ,pos
 I got this movie from eBay mainly because I'm gay and I love Til Schweiger. However it's one of those movies that when you watch it a second time you never say to yourself Hmm. I forgot about this boring part. I'll go make popcorn. It doesn't have that part. It's a very fluid and constantly interesting film. And yes Til Schweiger is worth it if nothing else. But it's a great movie even for straight guys. ,pos
 I was on a British Airways flight from London to New York when I saw this movie. I wish I could have fallen asleep. The story line was very thin and the editing crew did their best to stretch it out as long as they did. Gary played by Andy Garcia was such an unlikable character that I found it hard to be supportive of him. Andy's acting ability is good but not good enough to make up for the poor writing in this movie. Andie MacDowell did a fine job with her portrayal of Linda Gary's romantic interest. I can not say anything bad about Andie I always enjoy her acting. The problem here is that the romance between Andy and Andie is so far fetched and unbelievable. The two do not make a good pair on the big screen. The end of the movie was almost as much of a let down as the movie itself. A nod from the Pope and all is forgiven come on. The event that allows this movie to have a some what happy ending and that the writers would expect us to accept it is pathetic. Gary does not change and only by the death of a dear friend does his situation get better. There are tons of great movies that should be seen before this one. Don't waste your time. ,neg
 While some of the things in Haggard are dumb and unnecessary the overall package is good. Haggard follows Ryan Dunn and his friends Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon Dicamillo) trying to win back Glauren (Jenn Rivell) Ryan's ex. The story is followed and developed surprisingly well it doesn't wonder off and become an episode of Jackass or Viva La Bam although it does have a side story which doesn't hurt the main story. And for all the Bam fan boys (And girls) there are multiple sequences of Bam skateboarding perhaps the weakest aspect of the film. Phil makes 2 surprisingly small appearances even Don Vito got a bigger (but pointless) roll. If you are hoping to see a comedy and escape Bam's craziness then stay away from this movie otherwise enjoy the time you spend with it if you can find it. There are some truly funny scenes in this film. ,pos
 This show demonstrates the depths to which UK TV pre-watershed drama has sunk. With these dull scripts mediocre acting poor plots awful dialog one is forced to watch a DVD of any old ER episode to see excellent hospital drama. None of the actors employed on this show seem to be able to actually act! If you want low quality but easy to absorb soap opera style TV this is the show for you. Personally I like something with more meat on the bone. Sadly as with all other UK licence payers I'm funding this dross. ,neg
 The main character is a whiny irresponsible study of how to throw yourself a pity party. She loses it at the drop of a hat acts pathetic is schizophrenic and left me wondering why on Earth she doesn't understand why these 'friends' of hers haven't called her in three years. (Get a clue sister - you're a juvenile mess!) I couldn't stand her or the friends. I never felt connected to any of the characters. To make the entire movie even more unbearable someone went far out of their way to put the world's most hideous collection of crocheted and knitted hats in existence on film for all of eternity (this alone should warrant someone be put on wardrobe probation for a decade!) The acting wasn't awful but not really believable either and in the end the only thing that I DID care about was the two hours I'm never going to get back. Don't waste your time - go catch up on a dentist appointment instead! ,neg
 The film is a gross misrepresentation of Orthodox lifestyle and practice. NEVER will a Jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place. Childless couples do find it difficult to cope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life but nowhere are they rejected by their community as depicted in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact many great Rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce. The depiction of Yosef a horrible human being is meant to - perhaps subconsciously - show the behavior of a typical orthodox male. In reality it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society. Both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable. It is surprising that so many people form their opinions about a society based on a MOVIE (by someone who is personally biased against a community). I have always thought that it is only the Orthodox because of their narrow-mindedness and insular lifestyle who judge all secular people based on the violence and immoral conduct they read about in newspapers or see in the movies. ,neg
 I watched this film on Telly the other night and little did I know what a cringe-fest it would be...I knew it would be stupid but not this bad! This film exemplifies everything that is awful in Australian comedy. Apart from the most tedious uninspired scenarios and characters I have ever come across (aside from those dubious French produced American tax break comedies!) most of the situations were boring unbelievable stereotypical and SO not funny just...terrible! One such scenario that really annoyed me was the nerds on the bus scene. From a screen writing perspective the writers used the most uninteresting - not to mention unbelievable - scenario to get these three stranded without their luggage...They are on the holiday of their lives and they're going to risk it all (including a $300 deposit luggage and room) to exert their rights to dance on a bus? I mean they're about half an hour away from their destination! At least they could have had the bus driver kick them off but no they leave willingly cos 'they can't take it anymore!'and wreck their holiday...Anyway I can't believe the writers didn't workshop this appalling scenario out. I think a ten year old could come up with 5 set-ups more clever funny and believable. I can go on with many others - the really unimaginative stereotypical psychopath the whole relationship with the angry jilted girlfriend and tag along virgin the 'Wow Man! Out there goth girl' inhaling stuff on the train - EVERYTHING was just woeful! I cannot think of one redeeming feature of the this film except that maybe the third wheel nerd was kind of cute. Spoilt his career by appearing in this trash though! ,neg
 Noel Coward is perfectly cast as a suave vain selfish well educated upper class publisher. The literary crowd that congregates at his office is equally lacking in depth and seems concerned only with their status and success. They constantly meet at Noel Coward's publishing office in the hope of gaining favor for their next book and to make sure they are not left out on the latest gossip in the artistic realm. Cora is a young idealist and poet who believes her love can change Noel Coward and that they can establish a long lasting relationship. She ends her relationship with her fiancé to become Noel's lover. However Noel returns to his playboy ways after 6 months and ends the relationship. This breaks Cora's heart and she eventually returns to her fiancé who has since lost his job and self respect after losing Cora. The story picks up when Noel Coward leaves New York City by plane chasing after a new lover a concert pianist who is just as shallow as he is. However a storm is encountered and the plane crashes into the sea killing Noel. God takes pity on him and grants him one month on Earth to find someone who will cry for him otherwise he is condemned to wander the Earth never to find rest for all eternity. The climax takes place on a dim rainy night and ends with a prayer and a miracle. A strange redemption occurs. The death experience teaches Noel the true values of life although his former associate artists are incapable of understanding his message. The film has beautiful music and the scenes are classic film noir. Unfortunately it is not on DVD or VHS. For those who enjoy this type of movie it is a classic masterpiece. Noel Coward's dialog is sharp and witty and no one could play the part better. ,pos
 My first question is NOT about the horrible acting NOT about the horrendous writing it is the directing. The choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions I have ever seen. Why does EVERY single bad guy have to die in slow motion? I was about to beat myself with a rubber hose. The camera shots make it so that you can't see whats going on. I was JUST about to turn the movie off because of Jalal Merhi's accent when it made it to the sex scene so I thought it might get better well it did not. If you rate special effects on an A B C rating scale I would have to put it around a W or so and did I mention the acting? Wow was it bad!!! And the WORST part of the entire Expect to DIE experience is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover which is: THE MATRIX JUST GOT DEADLIER . comparing this movie to the Matrix is easily the WORST comparison I have EVER seen. If you haven't seen this movie Don't unless you are looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall. ,neg

 Anthony Minghella's 'The English Patient' is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is grand and impressive in scale and yet so heartbreakingly intimate in its portrayal of human love and suffering. At the 1997 Academy Awards the film owned the night taking home nine awards from twelve nominations the most decisive cleansweep since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's 1992 Booker Prize-winning novel of the same name 'The English Patient' is a touching meditation on life love and loss tracing the history of a critically-burnt man in the aftermath of World War Two. During the war a man (Ralph Fiennes) is discovered in the burning remnants of a crashed plane. With his face scarred beyond recognition and with the man seemingly suffering from amnesia he is assumed to be an Allied soldier and is simply referred to as the English patient. After the war in the mine-ridden hills of Italy a kind nurse Hana (Juliette Binoche) who has apparently lost everybody close to her remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time she comes to learn more and more about her English patient who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer Count Laszlo de Almásy. Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash we learn that this scar-ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love. Via numerous flashbacks we learn of Almásy's former exploits in the Sahara desert and his romantic liaison with a married woman Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). It's certainly easy to see why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film blending the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection; not since David Lean's magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from Almásy's plane. Even in the film's more intimate moments excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene coupled of course with the brilliant performances from all the cast members. A long-time favourite actor of mine 'The English Patient' might just contain Ralph Fiennes' finest performance and considering his history includes such films as 'Schindler's List' and 'The Constant Gardener ' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly. His Count Laszlo de Almásy is initially a very sympathetic character but as we slowly learn more about his past his likable qualities are eroded by his less-admirable tendencies towards others. Ownership is a major theme of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates most Almásy replies with Ownership. Being owned. When you leave you should forget me. However as the relationship progresses and Katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes: I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine which belong to me. Juliette Binoche who received an Oscar for her performance here is excellent as Hana the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her. After some time of caring for Almásy alone she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe) who lost his thumbs during the war and who suspects that it was Almásy who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) an Indian bomb-diffuser in the British Army. However due to her past history Hana is afraid that becoming involved with Kip will doom him to death particularly considering his very dangerous line of work. At 160 minutes in length 'The English Patient' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old successfully finding a balance of mystery love joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful but also uplifting in its own way. Whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless in every case it is always better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. ,pos
 The creative team that brought us Police Squad - and the Naked Gun derived from it - said in interview that they were told by their network contact that the show would be canceled after their delivery of the first episode. Basically the show was never given any chance. Typical Hollywood. The contact apparently told the team that the problem with the show was that for the show to be funny the viewer would actually need to watch it; most shows are presented on TV with the understanding that the viewer needed to get up and miss a few minutes while getting food or going to the toilet etc. The humor of the show is extremely dry (it uses no laugh-track) and the universe the characters inhabit is one in which anything can happen regardless of logic as long as it was totally unbelievable; so for instance in one episode a surgeon has to bribe an informant on the street in order to get a tip on heart surgery. Those familiar with the Naked Gun films should be warned that there are a number of interesting disjunctions between the show and the films. In the films Nielsen developed a particular take approach - that is eyes widened when confronted with the unexpected. This doesn't happen in the show where Nielsen's Drebin is the center around which the rest of the universe revolves - nothing is unexpected to him. Also there are no romances in the show and no parodies of MTV. Finally the show takes certain risks that the films avoid; in the first episode Drebin to re-enact the crime has a squad of homicide detectives shoot each other from a number of different angles - ballistics the hard way. This is actually a risky bit of humor since we need to accept that it's perfectly normal for policemen to kill each other while investigating a crime for no other reason than experimentation. This sort of thing rarely happens in the films. Taken individually each of the episodes is actually funnier than any one of the Naked Gun films since they are both more compact (more happens in a shorter time-frame) yet more leisurely paced (there's not the rush for a punch-line as sometimes happens in the films). There are some inconsistencies that happen in the films (primarily 2 and 3 ) that never occur in the show's shorter time-frame. Of course there's no doubt that Naked Gun (the first film) is one of the great comedies of theatrical cinema. And if you watch the TV show episode after episode in one sitting the dry quality of the humor might wear away one's tolerance. None the less it would be useful to have a DVD of this and watch an episode a day for a few weeks - If laughter has as some claim medicinal value watching this show is good for one's health. ,pos
 In terms of historical accuracy this is the absolute worst Roman film I have ever seen. The list not only of errors but of plot ideas that are flat impossible would run longer than the three-hour film but just to give you an idea... Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal Democrats taking the side of the people against the nobles. This is patently absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could get. Their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that had been wrecked by 150 years of civil war. There had been reformers notably the Gracchi brothers who lived about 100 years earlier and to some extent advocated for the rights of ordinary citizens. There are several scenes that are utterly ridiculous if you know anything about the period. Cleopatra with Richard Burton will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded fanciful though it is. Historical accuracy is one thing. Acting and dialogue are something else and here this film veers perilously close to being a bad junior high school production. I burst out laughing several times especially when Julia the daughter of Augustus meets a lover. They clutch passionately as she breathes: My father... Ah your father your father.... your father would disapprove. Peter O'Toole is at his worst forced to gnaw his way through some very pompous and silly lines. The actor who plays Augustus as a young man is such a nebbish --- and the character is written as such --- it's impossible to envision him as the cunning crafty Machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here he's just a whiner who has to be told what to do most of the time. Charlotte Rampling does manage to emerge from an underwritten role as Livia Augustus's wife with dignity. Had she been given a fuller role to play she might have rescued this production from absurdity. There is some nice photography and battle footage helped by plenty of standard issue CGI. Oddly this was made for British TV (and appears to be a British-Italian co-production) but is labeled with an R rating. The DVD picture is excellent and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very nice although you only notice it during the few action sequences as the movie is mostly talk. Almost any Roman movie even Cleopatra or The Fall of the Roman Empire has more historicity --- to say nothing of compelling drama --- than this bizarre Classics Illustrated Jr. adaptation. This one gives new meaning to the much-abused phrase Based on a true story. In this case they could have said Suggested by real events.  ,neg

 I find this film meretricious tentative lethargic and skillfully a bad choice of entertainment on celluloid. But I admire the courage to throw away a script turn the camera on and act a fool. I find the inauspiciously performances lighting cinematography sound and whatever film school laws D' Urville Martin broke funny. Speaking from a film directors perspective there is times I just want to drop everything and have fun on the set. This film looks like fun. When other aspiring film directors ask me advice I just tell them to watch any film by Rudy Ray Moore. They always return a puzzled look asking me why not watch the masters Woody Allen Scorsese Lucas Capra? I laugh and include that you always want to know what not to do in cinematic story telling first. ,pos

 As I was reading through the comments I was surprised to come across one that said this movie was not very profound. I have to disagreethis has to be one of the deepest and most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. Yes the acting and the music were excellent; they have been praised over and over in the reviews. However I also praise the heart of the movie. It resonates with deep meaning and feelingit is a story of redemption. It is about two very different and very flawed characters beaten down by life but too strong to lie down and die. It is about a man seeing more value in a girl than she saw in herself. It reminded me strongly of the book Redeeming Love by Francine Rivers which has a similar story of redemption. Yes the images and themes are messy and sometimes shocking but if you look close enough you may just see yourself in these characters. Sometimes the truest things in life are not pretty but they are real. ,pos
 In a small picturesque Sicilian village someone is brutally killing young sexually curious boys. The local police force keep busy trying to track the killer and whittle the list down to five or so main suspects including voyeuristic village retard Giuseppe (Vito Passeri) and an elusive grungy voodoo doll-poking backwoods witch named Maciara (Florinda Bolkan). There's also Don Alberto (Marc Popel) a handsome young priest who runs the local boy's school Andrea (Tomas Milian) a journalist helping to aid the police and the beautiful Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet) a gorgeous but seriously screwed-up drug addict who seems to have a thing for very (I mean VERY) young boys. As typical with the giallo subgenre the plot won't be fully revealed until the last few frames but if you can hang in there long enough this film pays off. The script (written by Fulci Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti) keeps red herrings to a minimum and will keep you interested and the story is ably supported by excellent location work cinematography (by Sergio D'Offizi) and musical score (by Riz Ortolani). The acting particularly Bolkan is also very good. Fulci fans who were weaned on his 80s grotesqueries like THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE will find more artistry and less gore on display here than they might anticipate but they'll still enjoy a particularly nasty chain whipping scene in a cemetery (bizarrely yet effectively set to singer Ornella Vanoni's ballad Quei giorni insieme a te ) and a long tumble down a rocky embankment that Fulci liked so much that he reused it in his film THE PSYCHIC (1977). Scenes of the children being killed is mainly kept off screen (except for a brief strangulation) but the camera doesn't hesitate to linger on their corpses. The film was not released theatrically in America and presumably because of some anti-Catholic elements in the storyline received only a limited theatrical release in Europe. ,pos
 I'll preface my review by stating that I am not a fan of the independent 'straight to video' genre that owes a great debt to the grindhouse films of the 60's. I don't own any I've never rented any so I might lack the appreciation for these tongue-in-cheek low-budget stinkers that many other people have. I caught this movie on Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. Please don't ask me why I was watching Cinemax late one Saturday evening with a lady friend. We were bored with World Championship Poker. Some atrociously bad acting courtesy of Misty Mundae (and I wish she wouldn't own up to being from Illinois as we actually turn out some very bright thespians here) caught our attention. Now normally the aim of some good soft-core porn would be to get you and your partner in the mood. Some good sex tongue in cheek humor and who know what could happen? After about 15 minutes and a scene where the title character seduces a mugging victim my lady friend said 'if you want to watch the rest of this fine I am going to bed so I don't have to. Please turn the volume off.' Here is what I gather from the plot: Misty's character is a sexless nerd who gets bitten by a spider and turns into a super-sex kitten with super web slinging powers that don't come from her wrists. There is some sort of evil villainess involved who didn't look particularly evil or sexy. Spiderbabe saves the day has sex M.J. (who is male in this film) constantly gets propositioned by stereotypically bad gay bikers and somehow the evil villainess gets pushed off a building to her death. What was good about this film? It ended. What was bad about it? Acting to make a third grade pageant look like Oscar winners a script turned out by people who I picture to be drunken college-aged sex perverts who wouldn't know what sex is if they took a class taught by Dr. Ruth special effects that were about as special as someone jumping off a trampoline humor about as funny as well I have yet to encounter anything that is lamer. The sex scenes? If we were watching a video the only thing those scenes would have turned on is the fast forward button. And the action scenes? Some of my old Atari VCS games had better choreography. Now I know this type of film is supposed to be enjoyed for it's inherent badness. Companies like EI don't set out to make good movies: they have a niche and they target it. My experience as a marketer tells me they are right on the money in servicing their audience. But after my brief exposure to 'Spiderbabe' I for one can say I am not delving into that world again any time soon. Maybe the problem with the filmmakers in this type of genre is this: they spend so much attention to making the films bad that if they made an effort to try and focus on those things they do very well they would turn out some very enjoyable 'le bad' Cinema a la Troma films in the 80's. Sorry folks; the spirit is there but the effort isn't. Though I have to admit that Alice in Acidland intrigues me ,neg
 Spike Feresten is a comic genius. 'Talkshow' demonstrates a fresh take on the kind of odd ball irreverence that have made shows like Letterman and The Daily Show successful. His likability is palpable. He seems to find the unique angle of the joke not the predictable sitcom path...thank God. His comedy is reminiscent of the award winning Arrested Development (cross your fingers that 'Talkshow' has a longer life span). The topics he highlights tend to be those things that pass by unnoticed by everyone else yet when he creates a joke around them out you wonder how you missed it the first time around. I particularly enjoyed the sketches... Unfair Target will be a cult classic in no time. Set your Tivo's people...this is a show not to be missed. ,pos
 This film SUCKS!! It looks like they just chose to place scenes together at random. Good gore but little plot. Sally whines and complains about everything till she becomes a demon. I figured that she had PMS. It sure seemed that way. The dubbing in this film is horrible. One scene the woman was talking and a few seconds before we hear any audio. I knew at that moment my suspicions were correct that it was not from the US. I tried to follow along but got lost about half way through it and found it very hard to believe even for a horror film. Some good characters but not many. Not worth wasting one's time. ,neg
 I found West Point to be an agreeable film although I doubt that I would watch it again. The performances were convincing with William Haines as yet another obnoxiously amusing young man that has his come-uppance by film's end. It's hard to believe that stardom beckoned Joan Crawford less than a year after this film was made as she looks rather awkward at times. I would apply the comment made by another concerning Ramon Novarro's Huddle (1932) to this film as well. There is a great film waiting to be made here but there is something lacking. The backdrop and integration of the Corps was well utilized but I was less involved than I thought that I would be. Perhaps Haines' character went too far or got away with too much. His repentance did not seem genuine enough; and what kind of message did it send for him to run every play in the last minutes of the Army-Navy game? Where's the Corps in that? Might as well have taken out the other ten men and let him do it all himself. Also I doubt very much that William Bakewell's weak puny character would ever have a real-life counterpart at West Point. All this aside the film is sometimes very moving and inspiring. It is a fine look into the daily practices of an honorable institution. Thank goodness that tradition still means something at West Point too unlike the vapid traditions of Ivy League schools only half-heartedly engaged in these days. As to the score: it was appropriately martial. But there was a distinct over-use of snare drums. Using them for knocks on the door scene transitions et ALU as well as in well over half the scenes got to be rather tedious. It rather lessened the viewing experience. I was ready to say I GET THE POINT ALREADY. With that enjoy the film but don't expect too much emotional involvement. ,pos
 What bird is that ? A maltese falcon. The only thing remotely funny about this movie is Michael Caines hair. Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it. The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue. Salutes to Raymond Chandler and Humphrey Bogart and crime fiction etc... seem obtuse and just plain silly without the salvation of any humour or pertinency. The reason this film has no 'longevity' and near forgotten is it's so vacuous an hour and half of pointless time spent in the company of second rate actors and film makers - This film is what the title suggests... ,neg
 Hell To Pay bills itself as the rebirth of the Classic Western... it succeeds as a Western genre movie that the entire family could see and not unlike the films baby-boomers experienced decades ago. The good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad! . Bo Svenson Stella Stevens Lee Majors Andrew Prine (excellent in this film) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are all great and it's fun to see them again. James Drury really shines in this one maybe even better than his days as The Virginian. In a way Hell To Pay reminds me of those movies in the 60's where actors you know from so many shows make an appearance. If you're of a certain age Buck Taylor Peter Brown and Denny Miller and William Smith provide a wow factor because we seldom get to see these icons these days. Hell To Pay features screen legends along with newer names in Hollywood. Most notable in the cast of newbies is Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah) who I've seen lately on The Young and The Restless and Kevin Kazakoff who plays the angst-ridden Kirby a war-weary man who's torn between wanting to live and let live or stepping in to do the right thing. William Gregory Lee is excellent as Chance Kirby's mischievous and womanizing brother. Katie Keane plays Rachel Rebekah's sister a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive but giving up her pride in the process. In a small but memorable role Jeff Davis plays Mean Joe a former Confederate with a rather nasty mean streak. I think we'll be seeing more of these fine actors in the future. Hell To Pay is a fun movie with a great story to tell grab the popcorn we're headin' West!. ,pos
 Cleopatra (the delicious Monica Bellucci) is challenged by Cesar (Alain Chabat): in order to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans she promises to build a fancy castle for Cesar in a period of three months without any delay. She calls the one-arm architect Numerobis (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered by gold if he accomplishes his mission or become crocodile food if he fails. Numerobis will ask for help to Panoramix (Claude Rich) Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This movie is very funny specially the parts where Obelix and the Pirates leaded by Red Beard participate. However the screenwriter and the director should have noted that French is not an universal language as English is. Therefore the jokes with words (like in Austin Powers movies for example) does not work well for people strange to French language. French people and persons fluent in French language will certainly like these jokes but they do not make any sense for me that do not speak French. My vote is seven. ,pos
 Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir the beginning middle and end of the story intertwine) and once with the director's commentary running. Quite amazing. A bare-bones tale told with more flair energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento which turned me on to Nolan in the first place. Can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and bigger box-office stars) in his next film Insomnia. ,pos
 This is an early one from the boys but some people may not be satisfied with this one like all the others. I found it to be different somehow than the your average Stooge slapstick. It was more funny for it's jokes rather than the poke in the eye or slap. Watch for a hilarious part when Larry grabs the stethoscope from Moe and sings into it. Moe gives him a good smack. That part made me crack up for a good ten minutes. Another hit for the Stooges. ,pos
 I preface by stating I am a big fan of JJL and NOT one of Patrick. Therefore I watched this to see her performance and of course it was excellent. I do not feel the director was adequate for the film as several very bad choices were made re: shot angles blocking etc. If the director was trying to give it a realistic feel they failed and lost some good performances because of it. Nearly always felt that the camera was way too static too far from intense facial reactions -- and so many times when the action depended on the intimacy of lead characters the dialog was slow and plodding. This easily could have been resolved by cutaways or changes of camera angle. But the impression I got was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also got the impression that perhaps scenes were shot multiple times and the energy coming from the actors was... used up. ,neg
 in a time of predictable movies in which abound violence cheap romance and melodrama it is delightfully surprising to find such a strange movie. the plot itself is compelling and the actors are excellent especially Alan Rickman. If you want to watch a movie that does not provide all the answers before asking the questions a movie that will surprise you (in good or bad) Dark Harbor's for you. And if you're not convinced believe me that Alan Rickman's performance is well worth it... especially at the end ladies.... ,pos
 I actually belong to the demographic Zoey 101 specifically is trying to target so I can see that as much as it tries to be relatable to people my age the premise is simply too ludicrous for an average person to relate to. The show revolves around the wealthiest boarding school in existence and the lovely incredibly tan attractive gang of one-sided characters who inhabit it. As is the tradition amongst kids networks the cast is an array of skinny white kids with the token black guy of course. The story lines all revolve around Zoey and her gang of friends stumbling upon or creating some sort of minor dilemma such as not wanting to attend gym class resulting in Zoey devising a scheme to save the day for all her friends. There is generally a B-line revolving around either a one- sided guest character or placing supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations such as having a hive of wasps in a dorm room and no one noticing. These plots often play off stereotypes such as any character who pulls good grades in math must by default completely lack social skills. The majority of episodes have the continuous and overused will-they won't-they Chase-Zoey dynamic. The characters unfortunately are all incredibly one-sided; there is Zoey the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything Chase the constantly lovesick still but rather endearing Best Friend Michael the token black guy (kudos to Christopher Massey for managing some genuinely funny one-liners) Lola the theater chick (meaning she dies her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of stardom despite the fact that she never does anything in the actual theater) Logan the womanizing narcissist Dustin the spazzy little brother and Quinn the science geek. The few words I spent on each of these characters sum up each character entirely. Zoey 101 does manage to be entertaining at times but the serious flaws in the system of values it promotes are a major turnoff. Zoey who is set up as the obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and who is on the surface portrayed as flawless still manages major character flaws. For example when Lola was first introduced she was believed to be a goth girl. Zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their shared dorm room for being freaky . As for the acting it is quite clear that Jamie Lynn Spears landed this role because of her name not because of talent. Although she has definitely improved as time goes by it is clear she is not a born actress which greatly affects the quality of the show as most of the plot lines revolve around her character. The supporting cast is surprisingly good especially considering the material they have to work with. They deliver quite a few good one-liners for comic relief if the plot hasn't yet ventured into obscurity. All in all Zoey 101 is a flawed view at high school life and anyone past their Limited Too years shouldn't expect much from it. ,neg
 Why are there so many songs about rainbows and what's on the other side? Kermit poses this relatively simple double interrogative near the beginning of The Muppet Movie while singing his signature song The Rainbow Connection. As time goes by the question and the movie only gain profundity. I'm going to forgo the review of this movie as a children's comedy but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that gains more warmth with each passing year. As the milestones in my own life come creeping up on me I hear more and more the evocative strains of that elementary ditty and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyone's life because we all dream. And that is what this movie is about. It's not just a bunch of puppets-- it's a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams which is a good lesson for everyone. And while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good they're not a fair judge of the movie. Only The Rainbow Connection and the powerful emotions it will realize. And it all fits in: Rainbow Connection *is* the Muppet Movie and vice versa. It's existentialism meets children's entertainment-- there's no simpler way to describe it. ,pos
 I am a fan of the paranormal and I love Ghost Hunters so when this show first came out I decided to give it a try. I could barely sit through one episode. The show is so obviously staged. I mean come on every single episode involves someone being possessed or involves a demonic force trying to kill the family. Another huge flaw is that these guys never debunk anything. When I watch Ghost Hunters they find evidence and try to disprove it and if they can't then it is evidence. On this show they find a voice or a piece of video evidence and they are very quick to call it a ghost. This completely ruins their credibility unlike TAPS and Ghost Hunters who actually know what they're doing. Honestly if you're interested in the paranormal and want to watch a show about it watch Ghost Hunters. ,neg
 I must warn you there are some spoilers in it. But to start it off I got Spanish Judges on February I think. It was mention it was the last copy but as I see it wasn't back-ordered. But either way I have it. I thought it was good. I wanted to see this mainly because of the great actor Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised no one on the reviews mention the scar) although it is kind of low budget getting enough money to make this film would be worth spending. Man what a good actor. The story it about a con artist known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who claims to have merchandises called The Spanish Judges. If you don't know what Spanish Judges are or haven't seen the trailer for this and this is the first review you have read I won't even say what they are. I figure it would be a big twist of no one knew what it was. He needs protection so he hires a couple who are also crooks Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) as well as a crook that goes by the name of Piece (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girlfriend who won't even tell anyone her name because she's from Mars as she said. So they (mainly Jack) call her Mars Girl . Everything starts out fine but then it turns to one big game. A game that involves some lust lies and betrayal. There was some over acting in it (Matt and Valeria as well as Tamara were not one of them). There were some scenes they could've done better and the score could've been a little better as well. Some of the score was actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and the end (before the credits) was a good song choice that's my opinion. The fight scene in the end could've been a little longer and a little more violent but what can you do? One more comment on Matt: Damn he plays a smooth slick con man. I know this is a review but I need to make a correction towards NeCRo one of the reviewers: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site she has been acting since 1983. To me and hopefully to others she is well known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both the Hot Shots! movies. But good review. Although I think it's one of the rare films I've seen and it's really good (which is why I gave it 10 stars above) I will give the grade of what I thought when I first saw it. 8/10 ,pos
 Basically a road movie. The gay transsexual and other gender-bender themes are rather disturbing particularly when the child is involved. You do have to hand it to the costume designers. As for the actors the only one I was familiar with was Terence Stamp. I suppose it was a very good performance out of his (or anyone's) normal range. The movie as a whole was shallow just a vehicle for the clever bitchy banter. All in all I don' recommend this one. ,neg
 This movie is a masterpiece of brilliant acting and timely patriotic sense of pride in America. The Nazi Saboteurs of the 40's are replaced by the Middle East Terrorists of today. The intent is the same to terrorize disrupt lives destroy property and kill Americans! We see a wrongly accused Barry (Bob Cummings) on the lamm trying to uncover the real Nazi terrorists plot meeting the beautiful Pat (Priscilla Lane) and together they travel to New York chasing the devious and evil saboteur Fry played expertly by Norman Lloyd. Along the way they encounter the also very sinister Otto Kruger playing the leader of the Nazi saboteur ring but disguised as a distinguished model citizen where Barry seeking saboteur Fry takes him into his confidence only to handed over to the local law enforcement. He escapes meets a kindly blind gentleman and his niece enter Priscilla Lane. From there Barry and Pat travel to Soda City Cal. run into the West coast saboteur gang heading East. They trail ends up in the mansion of a unlikely New York Socialite. The going gets tough when the bad guys kidnap Pat from Barry and he goes after her with reckless abandon. The movie climax is the famous Statue of Liberty scene which is excerpted in many compilations. This is a true blue patriotic flag-waving performance at it's best and what is wrong with that! See this movie if you don't see another Hitchcock film. You will be swept up in the patriotic furore and the love interest between Cummings and Lane will make you wish they had been paired in other movies. She is the beautiful ideal girl next door often underrated her talent shows through in this film. See it and Go Bless America! ,pos
 That's what me and my friends kept asking each other throughout this entire flick. We couldn't believe how stupid it was! I think somebody shot this on their camcorder at home and snuck it into the movie store and put it on the shelf as a joke to see if anybody would ever pick it up. Well I guess the joke is on us. I guess I should have come to this website first and read all of the reviews it has gotten every single one says this movie is HORRIBLE STUPID and on and on. And boy are they right! Although it did provide some pretty good laughs (me and my friends were pretty drunk) because it is so stupid. We just can't believe somebody was dumb enough to make such a crappy movie! I swear this had to be made in the 70's before they had good technology for movies and stuff because every scene looks really crappy but when I looked on here it said it was made in 2001? What? It sure doesn't look like a movie that would be made today but I guess that's what you get when you use a camcorder and shoot home movies using strobe lights and really fake looking lasers and use real life people from your home town instead of actors or even aspiring actors. BTW-some of those chicks (or were they drag queens we couldn't tell!) were so fugly even my drunk horny college buddies wouldn't touch them with a 50-foot pole. So there's absolutely no appeal to this movie at all bad acting bad writing bad directing bad special effects bad bad bad. Don't waste your time or money on this one you'll be completely disappointed! ,neg
 Well acted yes. Very well I must say even though I don't speak Chezck. Nice cinematography. But the script is lame really lame. A predictable soap opera in which you know exactly everything that is going to happen. OK maybe the ending isn't as predictable but is it any good? It is one of those films that you have the feeling that have seen already and forget about the day after. I just got a note from IMDb saying that my comment was not long enough. That's really sad because I have no idea of what else to say about this movie which actually says a a lot about it don't you think? The thing is.. .It has no soul and no originality. Compare this movie with Barrio or Riff Raff shot more than ten years ago (or the extraordinary recently shot The Child). It's sad to see that this is a much worse film. ,neg
 The idea of young girl who gets pregnant at the age of 16 is nothing new to the drama genre. But it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre. There is this basic plot of Lorelai and Rory mother and daughter. Lorelai comes from a wealthy background got pregnant with 16 and ran away from her parents' house at 17. But this series does not start there it starts when Rory is 16 and everything is just about the problems of a single mother who has terrible problems with her parents and about all those problems you have when you are 16. Okay now again this sounds pretty normal but there is this little thing called joke. The Gilmore Girls talk incredibly fast and they make like 60 jokes a minute. Even if you don't understand all of the jokes since they contain hundreds of references to films music gossip history literature and politics. Sometimes you even get confused but that really is the fun. And not only it is fast it's smart and wonderfully sarcastic. In addition to that it is not only funny it has great drama parts in it and you can take some lessons from it even home. Which is a thing that does not go for every single TV- Series. So watch it! It'll lighten your mood and help you through hard decisions! ,pos
 I am right now watching The Big Chill on DVD. One of its actors is Meg Tilly. I looked it up on IMDb which led me to reading Meg's bio which mentioned and reminded me of Meg's sister Jennifer Tilly whose filmography included Key West which was one of my wife's and my favorite shows. I then read this entire thread of reviews. Wow I really loved that show also and agree with all of the sentiments about the quirkiness and uniqueness of the characters and situations. As most everyone else I wish it was on DVD or otherwise available. The last reviewer says he watches it on reruns so I wish I knew what network channel day times it is on. So if anyone knows how we can watch episodes of Key West please let us know. ,pos
 After the lead actress of the opera is killed in a car accident her young understudy Betty is brought to the forefront. That's very lucky for her with one problem: she has an admirer that has decided he will kill all her friends and make her watch. What is his connection to the opera and what is his fascination with Betty? I love Dario Argento with every part of my body. And I'm not an orthodox fan I think. Many people particularly critics praise his earlier work ( Suspiria and Deep Red ) but really frown on later films such as Sleepless which I liked. My favorite Phenomena is usually vastly underrated. Opera tends to fall somewhere in between. Some consider it one of his last great films others see it as part of his so-called decline. I loved it. The picture is crisp the music is great (unlike other critics I love the metal soundtrack) the female lead is someone I can feel for (not unlike Jennifer Connelly from Phenomena ). And the imagery... wonderful. Great cinematography and some amazing kill scenes. The concept of taping needles to a person's eyes so they cannot blink... brilliant. My assistant Tina thinks this looked fake but even if it does the idea is more than enough to pay off. And some great effects like a knife blade coming up inside a man's mouth? Awesome. Jim Harper calls the film stunning and calls attention to the innovative cinematography well-constructed shots and exceptionally violent murders. I agree with this completely -- one shot follows the camera through winding tunnels and there is a very interesting visual use of crows throughout the story. Mike Mayo likewise calls it visually fascinating eye-candy and lauds the crisp editing and flowing camera-work . It's really a wonder that this is not one of Argento's more highly-praised works. Argento returned to the opera with Phantom of the Opera which was a bit of a failure despite the casting of his daughter Asia and Julian Sands. Even more interesting this same year offered the release of Michele Soavi's Stagefright which (like Opera ) has a killer loose inside a theater killing off the people involved with the presentation. Both are great films with Soavi's more on the slasher side. (Soavi actually served as second unit director on Opera ... you can make your own conclusions.) My only complaint with this film is the length and pacing. While it is very beautifully shot and the kill scenes are glorious they are not as frequent as they should be. The first one takes over a half hour and then we get down times between them. The lead actress should be in constant terror but she is given time between kills to calm down as if everything is normal again. Not cool Dario. We need to keep the suspense low and the intensity high. ,pos
 The actors in this dark film are truly believable and well cast. The quality of the camera work makes you feel as if you are there The screenplay is intense and does not wander. The plot is one that makes you want to watch it a second time from the new perspective gained by the ending. We showed this film to a small group of patrons at Gadsden's Center for Cultural Arts. After the film ever patron was eager to discuss the film and one person called me the next day to say that they were still bothered . While we put an 18 and up age restriction on the film I would watch the film with a youth group as it is a very real portrayal of an ugly situation and sets the stage for great conversation. ,pos
 Don't let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you. You'll love it or hate it according to your own tastes. However if for no other reason see Greystoke to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he breathes life into his role. Ralph Richardson was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle Shakespeare; rather he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed. He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. His reading of the part of the Sixth Lord of Greystoke his last performance is to be cherished by all who love the theatre. ,pos
 I have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed. And in my opinion this movie lacks heart. I frankly didn't care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie. There was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn't because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life or trying so hard not to that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it. I have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. But I felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and I was left wondering what the point was or if the point of the movie was that it had no point. Honestly while I didn't feel like tearing my hair out during the movie I did remorse the lost time on the sad little film. I have no doubt that some people will love this movie but frankly I didn't. ,neg
 This film directed by George Fitzmaurice who made so many excellent films is well up to his excellent standard. It is crisp witty with some wonderful lines and has the inimitable Ronald Colman in the romantic lead. Colman plays the irresistibly charming younger son of a wealthy English peer. He is financially irresponsible (spending for instance £15 of his last £20 in the world on a cute little terrier whom he names George) but open wildly generous contemptuous of lucre irreverent in the politest possible way and hopelessly sentimental. He is so dashing that all the women fall in love with him. His girlfriend is a star of the music halls and hence in 1930 a denizen of the demi-monde played with her typical svelte narrow-eyed silkiness by the youthful Myrna Loy. Fitzmaurice was not a great user of closeups and gals of that day had their faces half-hidden with those awful clinging hats anyway so we do not get as good glimpses of the faces of the two heroines as we would like. The director seems more interested in the charming Colman anyway. The romantic female lead is the youthful and fresh-faced Loretta Young who had not yet become the proto-Julie Andrews we generally know her as but was still a blushing girl exuding all the sweetness of a rose garden and laughing merrily and heartily the whole time. It is obvious that a character with her terrific sense of humour was needed to appreciate the snob-busting social anarchism of the refreshing aristocratic character played by Colman. The plot barely matters as is so often the case with these light and amusing films. This is just such fun. ,pos
 Or if you've seen the Evil Dead trilogy and/or Bubba Ho-Tep then you should know that his movies are total farces. With Man with the Screaming Brain he goes all out again. In this case he plays smarmy American businessman William Cole visiting Bulgaria - when do we ever get to see that country? - when a woman kills him. So strange scientist Ivan Ivanov (Stacy Keach) replaces half of Cole's brain with the brain of a former KGB agent leaving him acting sort of like Steve Martin in All of Me . Yes the whole movie is pretty much an excuse for pure nonsense. Much of the real humor comes from Evil Dead director Sam Raimi's brother Ted as Ivanov's nearly brain-dead assistant Pavel. The two men have a relationship more like Laurel and Hardy or Gilligan and the Skipper. So just understand that this is a totally silly movie and you won't be a bit disappointed. I liked it anyway. ,pos
 This is the sort of unknown and forgotten film one dreams about discovering in watching old videos. It is a superb comic gem with brilliantly funny writing embedded in the marvellous array of characters a wonderfully inventive and funny musical score and witty light direction from Montgomery himself. This is one to watch over and over. Montgomery is a bit part actor who finds himself assigned by his military reserve division to infiltrate a young debutante's home to discover the identity of her former beau a suspected jewel thief. While the premise is rather preposterous the results are hilarious. Montgomery is the befuddled plant Ann Blyth is a marvel as the romantically obsessed terribly earnest debutante and the parade of comic characterizations from veteran stage actress Jane Cowl's lawyer mother to Lillian Randolph's take-charge maid - are all fabulous. Oddly enough this only earned an Oscar nom for Sound when it deserved top nods for Direction Screenplay and Musical Score. DO NOT MISS IT - it's one of Hollywood's best. ,pos
 It's a simple fact that there are many of us from the 80's generation who grew up loving those loopy John Cusack comedies made by Savage Steve Holland and while I prefer there other more bizarre out-there flick Better Off Dead it's hard for me to dislike One Crazy Summer a movie I grew up loving wholeheartedly as a kid into my teens. OCS was a follow-up to Better Off Dead returning Cusack and Curtis Armstrong from that film. Cusack is Hoops following graduation pal Joel Murray(George)to Nantucket for the summer to each some fun on the beach. Hoops finds himself embroiled in a feud with a blonde buff punk named Teddy Beckersted whose lecherous father has designs on bulldozing over homes of a neighborhood to build a giant condominium. One of the homes needing it's mortgage repaid belongs to Demi Moore(Cassandra). There's a sailboat race which might be their only hope of saving Cassandra's grandfather's home(..he had recently passed) but it has been won by Teddy over the past many years and Hoops is deathly afraid of boats over water. But with the help and motivation of newfound Nantucket friends(..such as Bobcat Goldwait and Tom Villard as auto-mechanic twin brothers!) George and budding love-interest Cassandra perhaps Hoops can come to terms with his fears and win the race to save the neighborhood. Armstrong has a supporting part as the son of a kooky manic weapons salesman General Raymond(..SCTV's Joe Flaherty in an inspired bit of casting) Ack who uses the training from his father to assist Hoops and company in their goals to win the race. Memorable scenes include Bobcat getting stuck in a Godzilla suit(!)running rampant across an entire model of Aguilla Beckersted(Mark Metcalf barely recognizable as Teddy's rather unhinged pops)'s condominium Hoops being chased by deranged cub scouts wishing to perform first aid George a victim of toxic flatulence Bruce Wagner's nutty Uncle Frank's increasing insanity every time he tries to better his chances to win 1 million dollars from a radio show and the wonderful Billie Bird as George's grandma who actually bills the group after a meal! Jeremy Piven as(you guessed it)a brutish jerk who associates with Teddy and causes trouble for Hoops and his posse the yummy Kimberly Foster as Cookie(..Teddy's girl who attempts to make-out with Hoops while he attends a luncheon with his father) and the one-and-only William Hickey as Old Man Beckersted who will not reward his son and grandson an inheritance if they lose the sail boat race. Demi Moore is cute but this is Cusack's vehicle though Bobcat and Villard steal most of the scenes their in. Again some delightful animation from Holland are sprinkled throughout the movie(Hoops is an artist appropriately). If you like his movies I highly recommend the underrated How I Got Into College. ,pos
 This film tops the previous incarnation by a mile taking everything to the next level. As always the JackAss guys are purely unbelievable and I personally laughed harder in that theatre than I have in a long time. Like the first JackAss this isn't so much a movie as an eighty minute long string of stunts and pranks. It is pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level. Essentially these guys are clowns debasing themselves for the amusement of others. And its great. The shenanigans are so low outrageous and often disgusting that they transcend into a higher form of entertainment. You can't rate this along other movies its in a class of its own. And it shines. Go and enjoy it for the pure spectacle that it is. ,pos
 I love the book. It's full of passion romance tension... and the movie drags along taking two spunky stars with it. Kylie Minogue was already a major star in Australia having starred in Neighbours and releasing her first single. The decision to cast her in The Delinquents was surely a marketing ploy. For me it didn't pay off. Kylie may have been great in Neighbours but she was far too sweet and innocent to play the feisty Lola... and she wasn't of Asian descent as Lola was. Charlie Schlatter was an excellent Brownie but there was no chemistry between him and Kylie. By and large the movie was boring. It dragged on it lacked the passion of the book it focused heavily on Kylie and in general was completely disappointing. ,neg
 Upon writing this review I have difficulty trying to think of what to write about. Nothing much happens in this film. The storyline is a South Asian woman who falls for an English Londoner. The problem is he and his friends have had a racist streak. At the same time her friend at work is unknowingly to her having sexual relations with her brother and it just escalates from there. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. As soon as all this stuff has happened it's all pretty much standard. It drags slightly even though it's only about 90 minutes long. This is more of a Chick Flick than anything else. So if you're male I do not recommend this film to you. ,neg
 If you read the book by Carl Hiaasen the movie follows pretty much true to form with a few minor changes for Hollywood. In my opinion this is a great family movie. Luke Wilson (Officer Delinko)pretty well steals the show from an all-star cast that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The kids in the movie do a great job led by Logan Lerman Brie Larson and Cody Linley. Brie Larson is maybe a little too petite to play Beatrice. I pictured a bigger girl maybe 6 foot 175 lbs in the role of Beatrice. This might have made her more believable in her role of beating up Dana. They should have developed her tough girl character more and had her bite through a tire or kick a soccer ball through a person. She is very pretty and I understand why she was cast she is a box office attraction. This is about as PG as a movie gets these days no sex and very little violence. This movie is a parents'dream come true a movie with a strong environmental message with kids that have deep appreciation for the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. It shows how adults have fallen short in the stewardship of our planet and that our children can demand better. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Mullet Fingers says Florida could use some mountains like Montana. Florida is so flat there is nothing to stop developers from clearing it coast to coast . Also the photography of Florida wildlife spoke volumes without dialog. As a family movie with kids ages 5-15 this is a great movie! As a bonus parents' will be entertained especially if they're parrotheads . ,pos
 Abysmal Indonesian action film from legendary Arizal triumphantly sculpts a template for future Cinemax pap like 'China O'Brien' and 'Do or Die' with Erik Estrada while simultaneously burying poor rising action star Pat O'Brien with a hackneyed backyard script and three cans of hair-styling gel to perm his impressive 1984 mullet. This guy's physical prowess resembles a more femme Mark Gregory and his next credit would be second fiddle to Chris Mitchum as Tom Selick. Powerful. At least the action is mindless and non-stop with some daring Asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is essentially a poorly constructed movie by teens and/or meth addicts with no concept of reality. One poor extra gets gorno-ly shredded by an electric hedge clipper and many more are killed by getting hit in the head by odd objects such as a motorcycle wheel or cardboard box. Classic rape scenes are tasteless and priceless and quotable dialog such as I would rather trust a rattlesnake! are delivered with such exuberance and fervor from the third-rate polizioteschi voice actors. Random highlight: some crazy dude eating live lizards. Movie also holds the record for most cars driven through walls. 2/10 ,neg
 Egads. I used to think Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood. I not so sure anymore Willy gives Keannu some stiff competition with his I'm made of plaster performance in this movie. Combine that with the fact that there is almost no plot and not a single likable character and it's pretty hard to recommend this turkey. Natasha tries her best but even Julia Roberts couldn't save this flick from obscurity. Avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else on. -Oh heck in that case just read a book. ,neg
 Early in the movie Cagney's Johnny Cave character tells his gumshoes in the Office of Weights and Measures that in the previous year unscrupulous shop owners had cheated the American consumer out of more money than the aggregate National War Debt! Then he goes out and tickets a particularly greasy green grocer for short-selling him a bag of sugar that is four ounces off (oh the horrors!!) and one skinny chicken that his butcher's scale has rather generously proclaimed to be six lbs. after which the fur--or in this case feathers--flies. Er fly. When a racketeer in politician's clothing attempts to derail an investigation into the paltry poultry purveyor's practices our hero becomes a lone wolf waging the war of the weights on behalf of housewives across America. After all four cents here and a quarter there add up and before we know it we have anarchy! Word of his intransigence soon reaches both the Mayor and the Governor's offices and Cagney becomes a marked man. If it sounds silly it's not--the dishonest retailing practices are only a plot tool (or as Hitchcock would say the McGuffin) and while unfamiliar it works every bit as well here as any Treasury Agent or G-man anthology in which the fight is taken to shady crooks who are operating outside the interests of the country's common good. The production standards are decidedly Grade-B but it is Cagney who makes this movie the delight that it is: this was his first film away from Warner Brothers after seeking release in court from his unreasonable contract and he seems to be at ease and enjoying himself tremendously--the performance turned in here is intelligent and crackles with his unique energy and surefire charisma. Mae Clarke's presence lends a definite Warner's feel to the overall production. The supporting players turn in solid performances and the story moves along smartly after a rocky introduction that seems to begin three or four reels into the story--but sit back and enjoy it for the Cagney showcase and engaging Depression-era time capsule that it is. ,pos
 The funniest thing about Fortunes is that one of the main characters Lewis (Urbaniak) has writer's block and apparently so did the screenplay writer for the film. This is sad as well as I guess by large this is supposed to be a comedy or dramedy but that's the funniest thing I can remember from watching this. Three friends go out and drink one night. On the way home two decide to get their fortunes told by a gypsy as they call her. Those two lives fall apart while the third friend stands by. Then nothing happens. I hope I didn't spoil the movie there but really this extremely low-budget bad quality movie had some kind of idea when it started but quickly snowballed into the depths of hell. Yeah I'm being harsh. Honestly it wasn't that bad it was just blah. The aforementioned writer was annoying to watch though he delivered maybe one or two of the only two funny lines. The clichéd ladies man the only one that didn't get his fortune told was just annoying. The only bright spot was the remaining friend the married dad whose fortune was told that something big was to happen to his son and he needed to be prepared. He was funny genuine and clearly the best actor in the movie. Unfortunately that's not saying much. Perhaps I'm being too cruel. Heck they got the ambition to make a movie went and got funding and accomplished something. Unfortunately however I can't at all recommend the film on the basis there's hundreds of thousands of other independent movies that have hundreds of thousands better ideas and executions. This one was literally 10 minutes of an idea stretched another 81 boring minutes. ,neg
 It is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in Africa as they are definitely too few. However the movie depicts Lumumba as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old colonialist one... I felt it hard to sympathise with this kind of leadership yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man. There was too little content explaining how the man got to rise in the first place and the whole context of Belgium letting them go . So it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent especially Mobutu himself. I would just have liked a better political analysis. ,pos
 Intense funny witty and more than anything social comedy on the ways of adult dating and it's results-be it good or bad. Mohr and Nicholson are engaged couple two months away from a wedding date when a bizarre event at their engagement party forces Nicholson to re-think the relationship and start to date other people so she won't feel so pristine when it comes to sexual experience. This leads to a disaster of events following Mohr Nicholson and their cohorts. Very intelligent and needed in this time of clumsy condescending comedy while containing your usual variety of comedic sexual and frustrated characters(especially Charles as a sexually frustrated sex fiend...very annoying) who even they seem to get the right feel to this heart felt commentary. The film goes the way films should go these days showing that guys are sensitive at heart and have morals. Most of the male characters are the moralistic straight forward eyes while the woman are the fresh faced street prowlers who will stop at nothing to get pleasure. Guys will be appreciative of the message made for guys with self respect however it is easy to assume that most males who DO see this film will use it's message of male sensitivity cover up any flaw or trait that a female might find offending. Still the writing formula uses this as a tool to pave the way for it's male leads particularly those of Mohr Richter and finding the director in a cameo as a sales man! The females are by far the most promiscuous as they speak of nothing but pleasure and what it would be like to... with someone else. They have amicable traits though even though they are covered by the image of sex driven kittens. Very funny stuff. On another level the film follows some of it's ensemble into different relationship work. Richter meets up with a stressed divorcée(a VERY remarkable and noteworthy performance by the always reliable Helen Slater) named Penelope who is divorced with a son who hates her for splitting with his father. As the two go deeper into a relationship human interest is revealed and both the comedy and tragedy of divorce and starting anew are studied. By the end of the film Mohr and Nicholson have become way to deep over the heads to see what's coming next and it is up to what they have learned about each other and themselves to decide what will come next. It becomes appropriate and dramatic at just the right time. Wallodorski's direction is emulated very well when the characters learn to face each other after all that has happened...with the right ending. All in all this film should have been released nationwide and I should hope that it is up for some Academy Awards...maybe Helen Slater can finally get the recognition she deserves. Anywho this film is a no hits miss give it all you got romantic sex farce displayed very maturely and aesthetically. Great film! ,pos

 This was truly the most painful experience I have had in quite some time in a movie theater. I will forego such facile criticisms as 'maudlin' or 'historically inaccurate' or 'horse's crap's crap' because quite simply our sympathies would then immediately go out to these words. If a director's to make a sweeping grandiose love epic well for god's sake MAKE A REAL DAMN SWEEPING GRANDIOSE LOVE EPIC! Why bother with such laughably unconvincing second rate harlequin romances and such boring interchanges between characters we could care less about when the most decisive battle on Canadian soil is taking place? And for the pompous people thinking 'oh well this story must center characters! well you're wrong dead wrong. ,neg
 I'm not going to bother mentioning any of the plot - this is strictly a B movie on its way to obscurity. The shock to me though is seeing what has become of some of the actors in this film. Erika Eleniak never anything you'd call a thespian anyway seems to have morphed into Anna Nicole Smith (in her Big period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost shed a tear. He's always been a favorite of mine because of his martial arts prowess as seen in the Bloodsport series (also B movies but if you like martial arts eminently watchable). Here he is a shell of his former self - sure he's older but doing the mercenary thing and not even looking interested ... I just don't get it. Don't these people invest? William Forsythe is another heavy that I've always liked but his last several roles are what you would call mailing it in . I'm not going to even mention Mr. Reynolds - his gig here amounts to a throwaway nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff as usual a creepy evil pockmarked villain with a sandpaper voice that can curdle milk - the best kind! This is a movie you watch for laughs. There's nothing else to it. ,neg
 This is one of the most anti-traditional war movies about was I have seen. Instead of the typical films that stress glory and perhaps super-human characters (like John Wayne) this film is the exact opposite--stressing the de-humanization that ALSO happens in war. The story concerns the Japanese who are stranded in the Phillipines after the US returned in late 1944-early 1945. By the time the movie begins the Japanese have clearly been beaten but because of the insane logic of Bushido they cannot allow themselves to consider surrender. At one of many poignant moments the lead character is told at the beginning of the film to report to the hospital since he isn't capable of fighting due to his TB. The problem is that the hospital won't accept him so his commander tells him to once again go to the hospital--and if they won't accept him he should blow himself up with a grenade! Well this happens just in the first five minutes of the movie--a lot worse things befall this soldier and the few stragglers because they won't surrender. Plus there is a case in the movie where a soldier DOES try to surrender but is gunned down. This happened a lot later in the war because so often the surrendering Japanese soldiers booby-trapped themselves to blow up when they came near. In addition the film shows the most vivid depiction of starvation and the accompanying madness of any film I have seen. In addition cannibalism cowardice and betrayal all accompany this very gritty realistic and depressingly realistic film. You simply couldn't have made a better film of this type. Horrible but great. ,pos
 Labyrinth of Passion --with the possible exception of Matador --is Almodovar's best film. It displays his unique personality at its best and least-censored before he started going more mainstream. Almodovar is just about the only modern director that can approach Preston Sturges' wonderful brand of lunacy. It's pointless to try and explain what the movie is about the real point being Almodovar's willingness and skill in taking his situations to the outer limits of sanity and sometimes of plausibility and taste as well. ,pos
 This was/is an incredible movie with incredible cast music singing story etc. It is a tragedy that some arrogant families (the Gerswhins or Premingers) can keep it from being available to generation after generation. I have wanted to see it again all of my life. I just found this site and read why it has not been available. Shame on these families for their pettiness. My wife is from Germany and she has never seen the movie. Neither have my step-children or my grandchildren. It is very sad that a movie of this depth and quality is not available for them to see. Where do these families get off making such a conceited self-important egotistical condescending decision to prohibit generations from enjoying this film these stars these performances this music! Release the video and let them world judge and enjoy! ,pos
 This film is sometimes called 'The Story of O-Pt.2' which tries to pass itself off as a sequel (of sorts)to the French erotic S&M thriller 'The Story Of O'. Although I've never seen the original version I did however get to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual & social politics. I guess the 'O' angle comes from the occasional S&M overtones (which were never as explicit (and unpleasant to watch) as the ones in 'Mistress'. Klaus Kinski is the only recognizable face in this French/Japanese production (but speaks his lines in English--at least in the version I saw). The unnecessary use of surrealism only manages to make this some what boring example in pseudo porn even more pretentious (what are they trying to prove with depicting a piano floating in water?). It's obvious that after the whole porno chic trend in cinema petered out (ouch-sorry bad pun!)about 1975 producers had to scrape the bottom of the barrel trying to please the mavens of adult cinema not to mention Foreign/Art Cinema so film goers had to contend with dreck like 'The Last Woman' and others like it. ,neg
 Every time I see a film like this I get sick to my stomach. When I watch a movie I like to see what I see in everyday life. As I go through my day I see blacks whites Asians Latinos etc...How do you cast a film and don't even think of the possibility that other ethnic groups will walk past you? I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose but pay attention. I don't care if it takes place in Kansas or South Central. All I saw was one token black. This was typical in the 80's. Hey! it's 2007 with all the rappers singers and athletes working as actors Thomas Haden Church could have paid more attention to his cast. Aren't actors supposed to be more liberal? ,neg
 This is one of the best movies I've seen. The acting is good the plot is solid and the whole movie is very believable which adds a lot to the movie. I rate this at least a 9. ,pos
 The first time I watched this show it was OK. There were some funny moments and I laughed a couple of times but this show is getting worse and worse. Carly and Sam's web show is NOT the least bit funny. They play a stupid video from the internet scream at the camera and make some very bad jokes. And then the laugh track goes off?! One problem with the show is that none of the main characters are funny. Carly is not funny. Miranda Cosgrove's acting is lackluster at best. Her acting in this show is nothing like her acting from Drake And Josh. Her friend Sam is very rude and crude and the show is written in a way that makes her look like some kind of hillbilly. I mean they make jokes about her mom driving a rusty old truck her mom smashing an old TV with a bat and then there's the jokes about Sam failing in school getting detention all the time and running from cops. None of that is funny at all. Then there's Freddy who is a computer geek. He isn't too funny unless his Mom is treating him like a baby. The show's only somewhat funny full time character is Carly's brother Spencer. He makes some funny jokes and does some pretty funny things like pretending to drive a space ship while making spaceship noises knocking over a girl scouts' cookie table for revenge as they did the same thing to him. His material is the only thing worth laughing at. Aside from the characters other things make the show bad too. Like the fact that a couple of kids doing a local web show from a Seattle apartment is a worldwide hit and got them a free trip to Tokyo? Another thing is that how can a 26 year old single guy with no real job can pay for a 2 level apartment in downtown Seattle and raise his 13 year old sister and pay for a room full of camera and sound equipment including a remote controlled projector and a green screen and an HD camera? This sounds like it was written by a 10 year old. The worst thing is that the show contains some pretty questionable content. There are a couple of times when Carly(remember a 13 year old girl) appears on her internet web show in a bikini top. WTF? Then I saw an episode where Freddy tells Carly and Sam that he slept in JUST his socks the night before. I mean WTF? Then there's an episode where Carly's rival Nevel blackmails her by taking her website rights and agrees to give her the website back in exchange for a kiss. Creepy! And I just saw an episode where Carly meets a boy who just moved into their apartment building and he has some kind of back injury and he takes off his shirt and Carly stands there drooling over him. I can't believe Nick even lets them show that kind off stuff and I can't believe that this was created by the same guy responsible for Drake and Josh. This show is not appropriate for kids under the age of 12 and that's even questionable. iCarly is just another addition to the long list of awful Nick programming. ,neg
 I ordered this movie on the Internet as it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I've heard so much about the TV series from my friends and practically everyone in Turkey I was expecting to see a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment. Me and my husband (who is an admirer of any movie with a bit of Turkish landscape and Turkish dialogues in it) only watched it all the way through because we had paid $20 for the DVD. Well that was a boring way of wasting it. It was confusing at times overacted whereas other times underacted. The storyline was not only confusing but adding a gay man walking with his dog on the beach and using some toilet humor in the script to make it 'Hollywood' didn't also work for me. The American characters were almost too stereotypical that it was neither funny nor realistic and like another user mentioned the Turkish customs and lifestyle was irrelevant. The camera movements had no significance. Adding a few Dervishes (never seen in them in Kapadokya by the way) and broken plates -Greek style- only made the movie even more confusing. I am ashamed of this movie and all the noise the press has made about it. There are surely worthy movies made by Turkish directors which deserve more attention and respect. I give this movie 1 out of 10. ,neg
 Shes the man is great. its funny original and made me laugh so much i nearly wet my seat. the day i went to go see it at the movies i wasn't in the best of moods (man trouble)but leaving the movie i had a grin plastered on my face. The story is a bit out there with the whole no-one noticing that she looks way too much like a girl but hey who am i to say whats believable the jokes are great and some of the one liners in this 2006 hit could go down in history. Amanda B. did a great job as the main role and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true as her opposite as the gorgeous Duke. So girls go see this because its a great laugh and there's a hot guy in it and boys u go see it because you might just learn something about girls! All in all a brilliant fantastic and fun movie which i will be buying on DVD when it comes out. ,pos
 Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are both superb in Johnny To's tautly directed crime thriller which puts most Western efforts to shame. Think of it as the Hong Kong 'Heat' only better! Everything about the film screams class; from the performances to the soundtrack the cinematography to the script. The tone remains serious throughout but the film has a nice line in black-humour friendship and romance at it's heart. Sure it gets a little preposterous later on but it would be a hard-hearted viewer who didn't find something to love about this movie. Thank God Hollywood hasn't (yet) re-made and ruined a classic. Do yourself a favour and see this film! ,pos
 28 years before 9/11 there was another 9/11 which represented a key date in the history of Chile South America and the whole world. This was the date in 1973 when a bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende the first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and put an end to the Chilean experiment of a democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when the armed forces attacked the presidential palace. Unfortunately this film is too biased and too nostalgic towards the time of Allende's rule to be an objective rendition of the man and of his place in history. The times were troubled and Allende was a disputed figure in the history of his country and of the whole world. True he was democratically elected but his policies plunged Chile into economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup and a right-wing dictatorship followed with repression and flagrant human rights abuses but he was also an ally of Castro who saw in his policies another way of making revolution. We'll never know if his tentative to build a socialist yet democratic society would have succeeded. The authors of the movie take a completely pro-Allende position there is no opinion or point of view trying to explain the other side to answer questions like why did the middle class oppose him or how his democratic views could go together with supporting or being supported by Castro. The tone of the commentaries is nostalgic and apologetic almost propagandistic. People who want to get a better understanding of this episode of the history need to wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future. ,neg
 I gave this movie a 10 simply out of my sick obsession with Ingrid Bergman:) lol. I really think she was the best actress to ever grace this earth with her talent and all of her movies are absolutely wonderful (even when they are awful) because SHE is in them. If it hadn't been her and Vivien Leigh (as it had originally been desired I hear) I would have given it a 9.0 Simply because I love Viv but probably not as much as I love Ingrid. And any other actress would have made it maybe a 6. It's a good story two wild people falling in love in a society where it bad to be bad. Reminds me a little of GWTW except laced with a more highbrow attitude. Gary Cooper is very handsome as usual and of course his voice never changes the entire film but hey Ingrid makes him seem so amazing and dashing and 20 times hotter than he probably should be. ,pos
 I Love Ernest Goes to Jail. It's one of my top 3 favorite Ernest movies. The others being Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest Goes to Camp. In this movie Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a janitor for a bank but he wants to be a bank clerk. Soon he is assigned jury duty but soon winds up in trouble when the evil murderer Felix Nash (Varney also) knocks him out and switches places with him! Soon Ernest is in jail and is forced to act like Nash or else Nash will kill Charlotte Ernest's love interest. When they take Ernest to the electric chair thinking he's Nash he gets so electrocuted he winds up breaking out and goes off and saves Charlotte from the evil Nash! Filled with hilarious scenes and comics Ernest Goes to Jail is a movie that'll make you laugh so hard! It still does to me! Jim Varney was such a fantastic actor! He did a good job playing both good guy and bad guy! Varney was like his Toy Story Co star Tom Hanks. No matter what role they played their roles were memorabilia and that's one of the things that Varney's gonna be remembered forever for! R.I.P. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing Ernest and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10! ,pos
 There is no way to put into words just how bad how shapeless paceless and laughless these Vice Academy films really are. You have to experience one for yourself. For the third time in a row writer-director Rick Sloane does not show even an ounce of writing or directing talent. There is nothing here that a person above the age of 5 will believe or laugh at yet the (very brief) nudity and other plot elements make the films unsuitable for kids. Which leads me to believe that they are really aimed at adults with the mental capabilities of 5-year-olds. Elizabeth Kaitan makes a more than welcome replacement for Linnea Quigley - she is winningly bubbly and cute and her wonderful big smile is about the only thing that can make a viewer smile as well. But watching her and the other girls in this film is like watching a bunch of flowers in a desert covered with horse manure. (*) ,neg
 Peter Lorre gives one of his most evil performances as the owner of the titled place. The plot has a new government agent being put on the track of Peter Lorre's character. When the G-man's contact his killed by one of Lorre's agents the G-man is sent to prison for the killing even though everyone knows there is more to the story. Lorre has the man paroled into his care and brought to his island where he is mining diamonds. Lorre wants to know what our hero knows but he isn't talking and a battle of wills is set in motion. This is a good solid little thriller that doesn't quite make a great deal of sense plot wise but even so the film holds your interest. I had put the film on last night in order to use it as something to drift off to instead I found the tale riveting enough I was up an extra 70 minutes. Lorre is the reason that one falls into this. His quite demeanor is unnerving. He does very little but its clear from his orders and the way everyone reacts to him (watch how they light his cigarettes) that he is a bad dude. Worth a look if you should run across it. ,pos
 I learned a thing: you have to take this film like a funny period comedy if you don't want to be disappointed. The film's enjoyable because it's a delicious comedy. I think the over-hype damaged it: the too much glorified Monica Bellucci appears in few scenes and isn't so good as they wanted to let you believe. She sounds unnatural false: the best actress in this film is Sabrina Impacciatore who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines together with Massimo Ceccherini. Elio Germano is very very good: the most promising young Italian actor according to me. Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon but I preferred other actors. So the most hyped performances were also the worst. Costumes and production design are okay: sure American period movies are more accurate about these things because have bigger budgets but the Italian ability rewards the lack of money. A nice period comedy in short with a first-rate casting (except for Bellucci and Auteuil). ,pos
 Snakes on a Train is a movie I rented due to the pure amusement of the thoughts I had about the movie. Snakes on a Plane was an enjoyable Action film so obviously the film makers wanted to cash in on the success with this low budget effort. At 85 minutes Snakes on a Train is almost unbearable to witness. I had to keep pausing the film to do something to entertain myself due to the lack of happenings in the film. Throughout the duration of the film it's never fully explained why this girl has this curse or why she keeps coughing up this green/purplish goo constantly. Not only that there is endless boring dialog of the two main characters Brujo and Alma discussing how to get rid of the curse. I can appreciate low budget film-making. I'm truly not picky on movies i'm open to any genre or budget but Snakes On A Train is truly one of the worst Horror films I have ever seen. Were the writers on Acid or something at the end of this film?. Why did the woman suddenly turn into a giant snake? and most importantly how on earth was it able to devour the train?. Bottom line. Snakes on a Train is a movie that needs to be avoided at all costs. Don't be intrigued like I was by the title this is a movie that's seriously bad. Let's put these snakes to rest 0/10 ,neg
 My paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the DVD box sums it up: this film was far more horrible than horrifying. This is the worst film I have seen in as long as I can remember. My wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the Tom Cruise version. The laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off. The gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious. But as the film wore on we were benumbed by clumsy acting -- both over- and under-acting -- non-continuity in directing and editing trite writing and crude special effects. We gave up after a half-hour or less; after starting this badly it couldn't possibly get better. Since I despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics here are some examples of the film's especially awkward moments even if they amount to spoilers: - The lead says good-bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother the latter prickly because it's their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business. The son asks quietly worried will I ever see you again? Perhaps it's supposed to come off as a premonition but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situation. - A huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater. A crowd of people stands nearby peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally unaroused. One woman finally says it's gi-normous! - After this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants the lead and a bystander now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape have an exchange something like this in a quietly puzzled tone: What was that thing anyway? I dunno... - A crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military since part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship shoots an explosive at it the crowd starts to run away seemingly only because a director told them to and not because they're frightened or in any kind of real danger let alone unusual circumstances. And so forth... writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it. But please PLEASE save yourself the bother even if your morbid curiosity is piqued! The film is so bad it can't even be enjoyed as unintentional humor (versus say King Vidor's Solomon & Sheeba starring Yul Brynner wearing a wig). Life is too short to waste watching such nonsense. There MUST be something more productive and enjoyable to do like walking the dog or cleaning a birdcage. ,neg
 I rented this movie because Elijah Wood has done some good work and I thought this might be an overlooked treasure. It was not a treasure. I don't know if this was straight to video but it should have been straight to the dump. Elijah Wood fans will like the fact that he appears shirtless in a much-too-brief shower scene. But no sane person would like this script. Imagine Memento played by teen actors but ten times more confusing and a hundred times less plausible. Case in point: Janeane Garofalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently `keeping the chain of mediocrity alive'). As if false memories syndromes and mind-over-matter medicine weren't hokey enough the movie also hinges on one of those unexplained psychic twin bonds that keep the plot moving and the audience baffled. This same twin bond creates a few too many contrived love scenes between Wood's character and the girl from She's All That who plays the saintly sister of Wood's angry cancer-victim friend. Adding to the triteness of this screenplay Wood's other friends are a mentally challenged cancer victim and Kidney a young black boy afflicted with a mysterious kidney disease. Kidney's dying wish comes true when Dr. Garofalo gives him his own Walkman. This character's hackneyed function in the story is matched by his on-again off-again relationship to walking. Usually bound to a wheelchair Kidney has several inexplicable scenes showing him pushing others around in it. Kindey's characterization may be one small detail but it is indicative of this film's many other flaws. The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is definitely bumbling but it never flies. ,neg
 Watched the director's cut last night...glad it was free rental even a dollar would have been too much for me to pay to watch this attempt at film noir . The anachronisms (modern telephones) were annoying to me not clever seeming more like budget constraints than anything else. The non-traditional casting I also found distracting. If I have to stop following the story to wonder what the heck is the black chick/drag queen doing there? then the storyteller has failed me. Again not clever in my opinion but annoying and irritating and very film school final project-ish. And for pete's sake if you are going to shoot in black and white at least use some of the techniques used in old films that take full advantage of not having color. There was no use of nuance in the lighting no shades of gray no depth no texture...just black and just white...boring! ,neg
 The Bone Collector is set in New York City & starts as one of the world's foremost criminologist's & crime scene experts Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident which leaves him a bedridden quadriplegic. Jump forward four years & Alan (Gary Swanson) & his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped soon after New York cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is called to a crime scene & finds the buried & mutilated body of Alan. Amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence & makes a note of it which impresses Rhyme when he is asked to work on the case he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of Lindsay. Having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill & leave forensic clues for Rhyme & the police... Directed by Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night & I have to say it's one of the worst big budget post The Silence of the Lambs (1991) & Se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers I have seen in fact it makes Friday the 13th (1980) look sophisticated & realistic! The script by Jeremy Iacone was based on the book by Jeffery Deaver & is so poor on so many levels I hardly know where to begin. For a start it takes itself deadly seriously & that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad. The character's are truly awful & I didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. First we have Lincoln Rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there's just not a lot the script can do with him in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. He is seemingly impressed with Amelia because she stopped a train & thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance I'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there's Capatin Cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies how exactly did this guy get to be a police Captain? Then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? If they wanted revenge on Rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything I could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves the intended target Rhyme anything else. Also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! How did that happen? I should also mention Amelia who is a terrible character she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's & shoots rats for no apparent reason. Besides some of the worst written character's ever the story & plot isn't much better We never find out why the killer is using The Bone Collector book as inspiration We never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. It's never explained why a rookie cop like Amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. There is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. Also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they? I mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? Logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of New York to choose from? There's some nonsense about a bird that sits on Rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours The Bone Collector is really slow going. There is so much wrong with The Bone Collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever it's atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. Apparently Angelina Jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting. With a supposed budget of about $48 000 000 The Bone Collector is well made with good production values & that Hollywood gloss about it. I also must add right now that I think Angelina Jolie gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen I think she is absolutely terrible in this. Denzel Washington just sort of lies there really Queen Latifah is awful & even Michael Rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clichéd & one dimensional character. The Bone Collector has to be one of the worst Hollywood films I have seen in a while I saw it for free on telly last night & I still feel cheated & ripped-off. There are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing? Works either way to be honest... ,neg
 I worked on this atrocity ten years ago. Luckily for me no one knows it because I didn't make the final cut. And when I saw the movie in the theaters I was glad! My agents were driven nuts by the (apparently first-time) filmmakers rewriting the script daily and changing their arrangements with the agencies just as often. They later told me that once back in California (we shot in Atlanta) these professionals had 4 1/2 hours worth of footage! Even edited down to 90 minutes it's at least twice as long as it needs to be. I found Hulk Hogan surprisingly charming but otherwise -- what a waste of film! ,neg
 I'm afraid I must disagree with Mr. Radcliffe as although he is correct in saying this isn't a comedy it has many other merits. The plot is a little mad at parts but I believe it it all fits together nicely creating a satisfying enjoyable film. The last scene was rather abysmal compared to the rest of the film but the actual ending of the plot a few scenes previously is very interesting showing just what someone will do under stressful circumstances. I would recommend this film to fans of thrillers and action movies but if you're a fan of gangster movies then as long as you don't expect expect something as deep as Goodfellas then you should still find it enjoyable. ,pos
 R Xmas peers into the lives of a middle class married-with-kid family of narco-distributors during the Christmas holiday season. There's no story here - just a disjointed collection of events. Ferrara seems to get off on the juxtaposition of the holidays and home life with narcotics peddling in NYC jumping back and forth between each. The players appear to be improv'ing and adlibing now and then making for an unconvincing watch. Overall a poor effort not worth the time. (D) ,neg
 Badly shot badly edited clumsy dialogue flat characters unsuccessful adaption of a novel. It doesn't really get much worse. Decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom. Occasional good one-liners. David is a dim-witted young man who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in a Chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life. David is a member of a debt-collectors gang where every member has an IQ below sea level. A lacking script along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt-collecting look like a amateurish homemade reality show. David rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher Haraldur who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces David he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in Iceland. A severely lacking script doesn't offer David anything to base his opinion on. A couple of scenes SHOWING Haraldur doing something that David could have misinterpreted would have done the work. The potentials of film as media as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on are not exploited. At first David's connection with Haraldur raises his status within the debt-collectors gang but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies. The plot of the film is fine but then it is based on the book. This could have been a much better film. A good screenwriter could have made something of this material. Sadly that is not the case. The acting is generally good. Pétur Jóhann is excellent and credible as David. Eggert Þorleifsson doesn't get much to work with but does his best with what little material he has. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a tiny role) manage alright. Overall opinion: What could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim-witted anti-hero in a debt-collectors gang becomes a boring badly-crafted film made after a poor manuscript. Staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable. ,neg
 Yeah it may not be for adults and some adults may find it stupid but if you don't think about it it's really not that bad. The story has Alvin and his gang going across the world in search of jewels for a bad person and the misadventures that they come in contact with. So the animation is good and the story is cute and the songs are forgettable but it's a good movie. I give it a 6 out of 10 or *** out of 4 stars. ,neg
 I must say I was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an Adam Sandler Happy Madison production and I am usually attracted to that type of silly humour. There were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie. I realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all. The acting was horrible the cinematography was very poor the plot made no sense at all. I cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing. Overall I was very unimpressed with this film and I do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it. ,neg
 Seriously engaging intelligent and thought provoking drama at its very best. Mean gripping moody and captivating. Every home should have a copy! Don't take my word for it see it yourself. One Life Stand makes you consider your own lifestyle and how you treat your family and friends. Beautiful photography and impressive acting makes for one of the best cinema-graphic experiences of the year. John Kielty's debut is a delight and adds a real touch of truth and realism to this deep and gritty film. This is a film that cares and has an honesty that is unequalled in recent years. No car chases but a film packed with hum our and emotion. I first saw this film screened at the Edinburgh film festival in 2000 and am now delighted to be able to own a copy on DVD. ,pos
 It takes a rare movie to get better each time you see it. O Brother does that and then some. The first time I saw it I have to admit I had never seen anything like it. Then I wanted to see it again and now I'm up to double digits with this great movie the Coen brothers' finest movie they've ever done with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy coming in a tight second and third for me. George Clooney gives the performance of his career playing Ulysses Everett McGee a fast-talking know-it-all escaped convict who really doesn't know that much at all. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect sidekicks for Clooney particularly Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar a loyal albeit uneducated fellow escapee. John Goodman is my favorite bit character as Big Dan perfect. It reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coen brothers' favorites Holly Hunter and Charles Durning also provide memorable performances. Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their trade. It's not like they try to win Academy Awards every time they make a film they just try and tell a story that they want to tell and it's entertaining. It's a loose adaptation of the Odyssey and I mean loose for all of you Homer fanatics. It's just great. The most amazing part of this movie though is the coloring. I've watched how they got the dusty feel to the movie and I am still in awe just thinking about it. The coloring does become an important part of the movie. Great great movie. ,pos
 This must be one of the funniest Danish movies ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are hilarious as they drive across Sweden. I don't know how Ulrich Thomsen does it but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way. BUT if you don't understand Danish (I am not referring to your pastry here) don't waste your time on this  I don't think it would work with subtitles. ,pos
 This is what James Cagney is all about wisecracks cockiness hard as nails and no-nonsense charisma. Although the plot sounds serious the film is anything but. It is done in the 30's screwball comedy style and works well with his 'bickering' with fiancé Mae Clark and his reactions to the tall stories of his colleague James Burke. What raises it above normal is the dialogue and the cast that delivers it. Dialogue is good but it is nothing unless delivery is spot on and can bounce about the characters involved. This is done well by all throughout. Good entertainment and thoroughly enjoyable. ,pos
 When Alfred Hitchcock made STRANGERS ON A TRAIN it was a harbinger for the bulk of the film going public that he was back at the top of his form. From 1946 to 1950 his films were not box office successes and his contractual arrangement with David O. Selznick ended because of this. Actually he made some really good films in the period such as NOTORIOUS SPELLBOUND UNDER CAPRICORN ROPE and (my opinion) STAGESTRUCK. But while NOTORIOUS AND SPELLBOUND were liked the audiences were turned off by Hitch's attempts at experimentation: his use of a dream sequence by Salvator Dali in SPELLBOUND was acceptable as was the setting among psychiatrists. But the experiment with long takes in ROPE confused the public (making ignore the merits of that film) and the willingness of Hitch to have the audience fooled by a lie told by a leading character in a flashback was disliked - far more disliked then it deserved to be - in STAGESTRUCK. A matter of bad timing for UNDER CAPRICORN (it was released just as the scandal of it's star Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosallini broke out) made it seem to be a failure (which it wasn't). THE PARADINE CASE was another failure - and one that really had little in it's favor. With STRANGERS ON A TRAIN Hitchcock shied away from the special tricks that interested him in the recent films. Instead he concentrated on his favorite themes of shared guilt and mistaken identity. Based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith the story was of how Guy Haines a professional tennis player meets a fan of his - Bruno Anthony a playboy - who is traveling on a cross-country train at the same time as the athlete. Bruno is talkative and fawning and Guy views him as one of the typical fans he has met...if a little eccentric with his talk of wanting to be on the first rocket to outer space. But Bruno knows all about Guy's personal problems. He is married to a promiscuous young woman named Miriam and is in love with Anne Morton daughter of a Senator. Bruno knows that Miriam won't divorce her successful celebrity husband. Bruno mentions how he can sympathize - he hates his stepfather who is constantly criticizing him. Then Bruno mentions (sort of off the cuff) an idea he has about two men - technically strangers - exchanging murders for each other and then committing two perfect unsolvable crimes instead of fumbling them. Guy listens to the idea - and agrees it is an interesting idea. The train reaches Guy's destination and his last comment is like a validation of the idea. He just does not realize that the eccentric Bruno is a sociopath and believes Guy has just agreed to the two killing each other's foe! It's a wonderfully simple plot actually. Bruno of course does kill Miriam but he fully expects Guy to live up to the murder agreement and kill his stepfather. Guy is horrified - and worse he finds that he is the police department's number one suspect. When Bruno to encourage Guy mentions he has the latter's lighter (he pocketed it on the train) and can plant it at the murder site Guy finds himself in deeper problems - how to avoid the police and how to control (if possible) the insane Bruno? Hitch always planned the shots of his film carefully so that from the start we see both our heroes from their feet heading towards their fateful meeting in the train with each other. There are constant cross-contacts used in the film to show how the two men are drawn into each other's orbits. It is like fate drawing them together. Yet both have their own personality - and Hitch with a typical twist makes the mad Bruno actually more of an attractive figure. His scheme may be vicious (it will kill two people if successful and he will have Guy live up to the agreement no matter what) but he has a zest for life. One suspects that once Guy too had one but his marriage's failure coupled with his now dating a socially prominent woman has made him more circumspect and dull than he was. The cast is good too. Robert Walker probably had his finest role in this film (only a year before his death). It was a far cry from the homespun boy-next-door of SINCE YOU WENT AWAY or THE CLOCK. His lithe figure also looked quite elegant in tales in several scenes. As Guy Farley Granger acts like a cousin of his co-murderer in ROPE especially as the circumstances make him increasingly suspicious to the authorities (as his earlier role made his jittery behavior increasingly suspicion to Jimmy Stewart). As for the ladies Kasie Rogers is properly sluttish as Miriam - enabling the audience to be prepared for her demise (in a famous sequence shot in the reflection of her eyeglasses) so that they actually are cheering Bruno in his act of evil. Patricia Hitchcock appears as the younger sister of Anne (Ruth Roman) who bears a close resemblance to Miriam and accidentally sets off Bruno at a social occasion. She plays this rare role well. Ruth Roman is properly supportive of Granger but her role is limiting because she is establishment in her background and somewhat low keyed. Other supporting performers Leo G. Caroll as the Senator Marion Lorne (usually a comedian) as Bruno's dotty mother and Norma Varden as an unexpected recipient of violence from Walker are all shown to best advantage - all at the hand of a master. ,pos
 I loved this film! It has a great heart and great bones. I stumbled onto it by chance and I had no recollection not even an inkling of this movie from promos or reviews or word of mouth.   I remember reading many years ago a journalist who commented on the value of watching movies without having them contaminated by the pre-judgement of reviews or the false shill of the promos.  And this seems to be the single most common source of the critics' negative reaction to the film:  it failed to meet expectations of it being a comedy or a slice of life or character driven.  I had no expectation about the film and so it was comedic - but I only laughed once or twice - without being a comedy; it was about a person but so eccentric that it wasn't slice of life; it was about a character but the character was so intelligently optimistic and trusting of her instinct to life that it wasn't the angst-driven sentimental melodrama so typical of American 'serious' film - as I wrote that I realized that writer/director Lisa Krueger managed to poke fun at this schlock American sentimentality in the husband!  And very cleverly too! And Kreuger was able to keep the cloyingly sentimental ending from the screen when the wayward  not prodigal husband returned with his tail shrunk between his legs. Bravo Ms. Krueger bravo!  (Now I will be watching this film again as it is getting better and better as I reflect on it.)    Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant. I loved how subtly but completely she was able to portray and convey intelligent awareness of her committable commitment to honouring her words and actions - she knew that in keeping her word with a band or friends or husband that she was setting herself up to ridicule and/or disappointment in a world that was unable to honour commitment as she was able to do. But even with that strength she was fully connected to humanity and embraced with a fully committed heart their frailty and failures. The character of Joline was amazingly well acted and I left the film surprised that I had no recollection of awards nominations for it. Okay not that surprised as American awards tend to go to women in 'serious' roles filled with angst and the proper amount of nudity which this film did not have. What it has was far better which was heart in this woman's discovery of herself with the assistance of new friends and a self-deprecating shaman. I admit to being a bit of a soft touch for eccentric characters who manage their peculiarities while remaining honest and true to themselves as they move through the minefield of what comprises 'proper' societal behaviour and 'acceptable' interpersonal discourse. So if people must conform to normality in your world then this film will not be to your liking.  And that was it seems one of the common threads in the critiques. And I am always a sucker for a good play on words when it raises questions of human behaviour and ethical/philosophical values. Until this movie I hadn't made the emotional connection between being committed (to a cause or honesty or something) and being committed (to an insane asylum). At what point does one's commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life become a one way ticket to insanity? This sounds like a simple question or one that is easily dismissed as being rhetorical. But is it? And yet few of the critics - I think maybe two commented on this aspect of the film either directly or indirectly. A lovely film. 8/10.   ,pos
 Hated it with all my being. Worst movie ever. Mentally- scarred. Help me. It was that bad.TRUST ME!!! ,neg
 Four things intrigued me as to this film - firstly it stars Carly Pope (of Popular fame) who is always a pleasure to watch. Secdonly it features brilliant New Zealand actress Rena Owen. Thirdly it is filmed in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. Fourthly a friend recommended it to me. However I was utterly disappointed. The whole storyline is absurd and complicated with very little resolution. Pope's acting is fine but Owen is unfortunately under-used. The other actors and actresses are all okay but I am unfamiliar with them all. Aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie (and Pope and Owen) this film isn't very good. So the moral of the story is...don't watch it unless you really want to. ,neg
 The case history of 'Mulholland Dr.' is known: What should had been another excursion (after 'Twin Peaks') into the rivaled field of TV-series ended up abruptly after completing the pilot. It was too risky and twisted for the producers to venture an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be ranked among the best works of David Lynch. His earlier movies 'Eraserhead' 'Blue Velvet' or 'Wild at Heart' kept aloof in an irritating way which hustled the viewer into the role of a voyeur but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here. 'Mulholland Dr.' is a puzzle where pieces are missing others obviously were taken from 'Eraserhead' and 'Lost Highway' but it never seemed to be unfinished work. In the internet I came across with a lot of instructions and essays to explain this film. I am aware now that it loses its magic when you try to decipher it completely. All those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required. Imagine this scenario: A little child is dissecting his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies. Is it because it wants to destroy his toy? Does the secret lie in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it. David Lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to grapple with everything beneath that. Human desires dreams obsessions and fears - all that what remains unspoken; emotions that are often repressed. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance. Actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director selflessly.Laura Elena Harring Naomi Watts Justin Theroux solve their task in such an impressing way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast. While their acting at the beginning seems to be a little superimposed you soon will realize that this stereo typing is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to baffle him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible. When you claim the criterion of a well made film in being able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen than Lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifest David Lynch's status as one of the most important creative and courageous directors of the present. Like every film maker who go beyond the limits he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. This will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's world of films. 'Mulholland Dr.' is more than just a sleeper  it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema. And besides the film is a pay-off with Hollywood in form and content which in that distinctness was hardly dared before. ,pos
 I have seen this film probably a dozen times since it was originally released theatrically. Anyone who calls this movie trash or horrible just doesn't understand action films or recognize a good one. Perhaps to some the incidents and outcomes may seem far fetched but in my opinion screenwriter Shane Black ( Lethal Weapon/ Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) crafted one of the most well thought out action adventures you will ever come across. Over the top or not this film flows like clockwork and the action just keeps coming. The final action sequence is one of the best I have ever seen in any film. The cast in this film crackles. Genna Davis gave a tremendous performance and its a damn shame there was never a LKG sequel. Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as her sidekick Mitch a down on his luck private eye trying to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks. If Baffles me how anyone could not like this film. It packs so many thrills and its so funny. The wisecracks in this film still make me laugh just as hard 10 years later. In my mind the first Matrix film and the Long Kiss Goodnight were easily 2 of the best and most original action flicks of the 90's. Incidentally Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script. At the time it was the highest selling screenplay and its worth every penny. It's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance cause they would have witnessed Renny Harlins best film and Genna Davis like you have never seen her before. Long live The Long Kiss Goodnight !! ,pos
 When one thinks of Soviet cinema the propaganda masterpieces of Eisenstein or the somber meditations of Tarkovsky generally come to mind. They're great films sure but generally not the most entertaining material out there. However the countries within the Iron Curtain apparently enjoyed their escapist musicals just as much as the states had. In fact from the 1930s up until the 70s forty of these song-and-dance extravaganzas were released to much adoration by the public. However they are completely unheard of in the West so this documentary attempts to rectify that situation. It does a terrific job of both showcasing these films and putting them into the proper cultural context. Despite the fact I've never been a fan of musicals I found this documentary to be completely compelling from beginning to end. It goes to prove that no matter how many films you manage to see in your lifetime you're only skimming the surface of whats out there. As for the film clips themselves they're very entertaining. While some of the musicals are blatant propaganda showing workers singing of how much they love working under the regime some of the films (particularly the later ones) look quite accomplished from a production standpoint. Plus they are all extremely campy because of how alien they are to my western eyes. There's a few similarities between them and the American musicals I'm used to but the presence of strict government enforcing of a message gives them a surreal edge. They certainly don't resemble the musicals made in the West. This documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining films I've seen in recent memory and its an absolute must-see for any film buff. (9/10) ,pos
 Watching this on Comcast On-Demand. Every time I see this musical I am amazed at the songs...one show-stopper after another. This interpretation is for me magical. The songs sparkle...the vocals orchestrations and choreography are amazing for a made-for-TV movie...better than many stage versions I have seen. The debate over Bette just doesn't make sense. She is Mamma. Her voice is brilliant and yet full of the pathos of the stage mother living through her daughters. I still get tears at the end when she finally has her moment of glory no matter how faded that glory is. The Tulsa/Louise duet/dance is on now. Fabulous. Stephen Sondheim is the King of musical theatre. His lyrics just roll off the tongue like silk...Styne's music is perhaps the best ever penned for the stage/screen. Thank God we have this masterpiece of the American Musical Theatre captured on DVD. ,pos
 This is the funniest sequel I have seen in a long time it is much funnier than the other three and not a bit scary. It has some very gory pieces in the film but not bad enough to make you sick. In this one he has a female doll companion hence the name. If you liked the first three then you'll love this go watch it! ,pos
 The film Classe tous risques directed by Claude Sautet was not a film to be honest I had ever really heard of until the Film Forum in NYC said that they would have a 2-week screening of the film with new English subtitles. When I also read that it was in the vein of the classic French crime films ala Jean Pierre Melville I jumped at the chance to check it out (at best it would rank up with his great works and at worst I would get some good popcorn in a great theater). It was well worth the admission as Classe tous risques is one of those kinds of French films that is just waiting to be re-discovered (or discovered for the first time). With terrific tense diligence Sautet keeps the suspense at a tight pitch for the first forty minutes of the film keeping a good (if not great) middle section and then ending it up with what is always expected with these films but with fascinating motivations by way of the characters. With a film in the vein of this sort you know how it will end but it's the cool observant journey that counts. The film features a performance with some real truth and honesty amid the old-school criminal's code by Lino Ventura as Aldo who at the start of the film (one of the best beginnings to a film in this genre and country) steals a hefty amount of money with his partner in crime). When there is a sudden ugly twist of fate on a beach late one night Aldo is again on the run with two little kids. He gets the aid of Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo a role in tune with Le Doulos only with a smidgen more humanity and charisma) who is also a thief and drives him into Paris. But there are some problems with some of Aldo's old business partner's and one old score may be just the right ticket. A couple of times the plot may seem to be leisurely but it isn't. Like Melville Sautet doesn't allow any fat to his story and it's a very tightly structured film with some good doses of humor here and there (I was sometimes grinning at the audacity of the criminals in the beginning chase sequence and also with a particular woman who had a finicky thing with her cat and a fish). Along with a fine score by the great George Delerue exceptional cinematography and a mood that is seldom met let alone matched now adays Classe tous risques is a reminder of that bridge between the real old-school film-noir and the latter day crime films. Gangsters in these new sort of thug-life movies have a 1000th of the class and honor of the thieves in this film and is a second banana to the works of Melville and Jules Dassin (a compliment I assure you). That it has a good realistic moral edge helps as well. ,pos
 Absolutely nothing is redeeming about this total piece of trash and the only thing worse than seeing this film is seeing it in English class. This is literally one of the worst films I have ever seen. It totally ignores and contradicts any themes it may present so the story is just really really dull. Thank god the 80's are over and god save whatever man was actually born as James Bond III . ,neg
 I like this movie. I may be biased because I love dolphins. However my 3 and 4 yr. old will sit and watch the whole movie.... It's not Oscar material but definitely entertaining. The dolphin cinematography is well done with a beautiful backdrop of ocean scenery and sunsets. My favorite scene is when Flipper flips the pop can out of the water striking Sandy in the head. It's an endearing funny moment that makes me laugh every time. On the other hand the villainous banterings of the bully boatman (forget his name) are a little hard to take. And the shark scene is far from reality. Question: do dolphins really make that much noise? Or is there some serious dubbing happening here? Bottom line: my kids like it and it keeps recycling through our VCR. ,pos
 The music is by Stravinsky (and not by stupid incompetent Philip Glass) and was written ten years before glass' unfortunate birth. The staging is simply extraordinary. The narrative in Japanese adds a threatening quality and intensity that the Latin version does not have. cf. Terzieff's version. The giant heads and hands are totally justified by the mythic aspect of the tale. The props and make up used for the plague are simply spot on. It's Taymor's best work. The singers are very good especially Terfel. Langridge is quite moving and clean and Norman finds the right expression and her beauty is magnified here and finds its right place: larger than life. Simply a must. ,pos
 Good Lord... How this ended up in our DVD player I'll never know...my wife thought it was a new release she'd missed somehow...Nevermind it's a couple of years old and in Danish ( I think)... She kept looking for the English soundtrack... All in all...the film wasn't bad... Good production values better performances and a clever story that doesn't get too far away from itself make for tidy dark-humored fare from across the sea! The ending will make you chuckle...in fact the whole film will. Incredibly strange characters that we grow genuinely interested in make a film that might be worth your while...Without spoiling the plot the film's title and DVD jacket give you a good idea where this thing is going! ,pos
 Wicked Little Things has an excellent synopsis: empty house beside abandoned mine in woods with tragic past; family moves into house and strange things begin to happen; little creepy children begin to pop up here and there doing creepy-little-children-things. But that is where the cleverness and potential fun ends. This group of kids was sealed in the mine many decades earlier and now appear roving the woods (poor make-up) with weapons looking for flesh to eat. Oh I get it this is a ghost-zombie movie. Hmmm....while I can appreciate someone trying something new with this genre this just didn't work. What was the children's motivation in seeking to devour flesh? Why did they need weapons? Did anyone else imagine the filmmakers all gathered around the daily footage giggling because they felt this was going to be a cool/scary movie? I found that after thirty minutes I felt the familiar resignation that I had just wasted my time on another modern crap-fest. While the acting was good and the setting/cinematography of good quality as well the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge about the supernatural horror genre altogether. A bunch of kids walking down the mall is scarier than this pack of poorly disguised rodents. This movie is not scary and while I can appreciate the story perhaps have even enjoyed it if I had read it instead of watched it I still have to say that Wicked Little Things is more accurately called Wicked Little Turd. ,neg
 This film is a knockout Fires on the plain referred to is (the burning off at the end of harvest time) A happy memory for Tamura He relives this in his mind many time's and at the end of this bleak film Like a man dying of thirst he believe's he is home and this last illusion is all he has left. Billy Wilder's The Big Carnival (Ace in the hole) is the only film (that comes to mind)that is as bleak as this little masterpiece by Kon Ichikawa. While I think the whole film is brilliant Two scenes that come to mind are when a platoon of Japanese soldiers trying to escape (Crawling on there belly's)are ambushed by Americans and massacred True Horror And as an American soldier and a pretty Philippine Girl soldier are having a cigarette on the side on the road she smiles as she flits with the yank then her face Changes to rage as she see's two Japanese soldiers trying to surrrender she grabs a gun and kills them with joy The American soldier attempts to stop her but has no chance to me this speaks volumes at the atrocity's committed by the Japanese in the Philippines all in all a great film if you have the stomach for it. ,pos
 This movie was childish in its writing and laughable in its visual effects. Scenes where Father Merrin is tossing in his bed and his glimpses of a gimpy native are signs of bad acting and poor imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. The elementary writing leaves no fact to the imagination and leaves no room for suspense. The lady doctor at one point states that she thinks the town is going to explode soon from all the crazy happenings. There was in fact nothing in the movie to make that line relevant. From the terrible job the movie had done I would have never known that there were any tensions in the village. If you are into cheesy movies go ahead and rent this but if you want to see this done right check out Exorcist:The Beginning ,neg
 Even if you're a fan of Jean Rollin's idiosyncratic body of work you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory. For once there's not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight ! True to tradition the budget proved way too tight to realize the director's vision entirely. Yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity. Jean-Claude Couty's atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and Philippe Bréjean (a/k/a Gary Sandeur ) contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesn't resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore. Shot in and around a Paris office block before and after working hours the film was largely cast with porn regulars Rollin was already quite familiar with from his Michel Gentil cash-gathering XXX efforts most notably French f*ck film royalty Brigitte Lahaie in the demanding lead. Playing Elisabeth (rather well I might add) she's picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by Robert (Vincent Gardère) driving home at the end of a long work day. Barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there Elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur even forgetting Robert's name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment. Prior to making love she rightfully describes herself as a virgin (further credit to Brigitte's thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the '70s) because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his. Because of this nifty bit of context the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes Rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding. When Robert leaves for work he's inevitably erased from Elisabeth's feeble mind. A mysterious doctor (comedian Bernard Papineau effectively cast against type) and his menacing assistant Solange (striking porn starlet Rachel Mhas) move in on her during her protector's absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from. Here we get one of the movie's strongest scenes as she's re-introduced to her roommate Catherine (the late Cathérine Greiner a/k/a hardcore performer Cathy Stewart in a quietly devastating turn) both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate. That deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and Catherine's unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup. It's also Catherine who gets to voice the filmmaker's compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges Elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them. Several rather explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes make up the movie's mid-section and French porn aficionados should recognize the likes of Alain Plumey (a/k/a Cyril Val ) Jacques Gateau and Elodie Delage along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess Marilyn Jess whose rape at the hands mouth and member of Plumey was only present in the film's rarely screened XXX version FILLES TRAQUEES. The pivotal part of Véronique a girl Elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with is beautifully handled by the exquisite Dominique Journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in Franco Zeffirelli's LA TRAVIATA. The six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace. The final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of Chaplin's MODERN TIMES as Elisabeth approaching complete meltdown by now and a wounded Robert stumble along the railroad bridge clumsily clasping each other's outstretched hands. ,pos
 Admittedly I watched the MST3K version of this but it's not actually too bad outright at least compared to others which deserve my cinematic hatred. The story centers around a troubled girl wrongly sent to a reform school called Girls' Town. Along way races redemption and wackiness (unintentional) happen. The story and acting are a little flat as is the action. However the entire thing is actually entertaining to a degree if you are absolutely bored. Overall just a simple sub par 50's flick but far from the worst movie ever made with some bright spots in the movie (The Ave Maria sequence was good for me). If you get a chance to watch the MST3K version you won't be disappointed. By it self not so much but I can think of worse methods of torture ( Spiker anyone?). ,neg
 This film was strongly recommended by a friend and being a great fan of Brando I ordered this film from Harrods and eagerly waited for it to arrive. I have seldom been so disappointed by a film. Brando was good as a German officer but the rest of the film was simply unbearable. You never get to like or care for any of the characters (except Brando maybe). The acting was OK. Story what story? Maybe that's the point. It's war after all but I've seen far better war films. (Lawrence of Arabia Apocalypse Now even Star Wars) It was so boring I kept checking my watch... Overall this is one of the worst films I have seen. Please don't waste your time and money on this. May I also add that this is the first user comment I have written I just had to let my feelings about this film known. By the way my all time favourites are: Casablanca The Godfather 1 &2 One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you haven't seen them yet please spare the time to do so. And Amadeus MUST be in widescreen 2.35:1 ,neg
 This must rate with the worst films I have ever seen. It just wasn't funny. My wife fell asleep. I suppose if you are the sort of person who goes all gooey eyed at the sight of a dog then it may do something for you. If you expect a comedy film to have some humour in it then you will be disappointed unless you find an English radio announcer saying the f word a lot hilarious. The strippers in the club kept their underwear on so there wasn't even a bit of nudity to relieve the boredom. What did happen in the strip club made no sense at all. There was a great deal of mumbling by the lead character with whom I developed no sympathy at all. Mena Suvari was hardly in the film presumably just there to make people think it was a serious attempt at producing a film. The bad guys were unconvincing and carried as much menace as a dead sheep. ,neg
 For fans of Chris Farley this is probably his best film. David Spade plays the perfect cynical sarcastic yin to Farley's Baby Huey yang. Farley achieves strokes of comic genius in his monologues like the Let's say you're driving along the road with your family... bit the Jo-Jo the Idiot Circus Boy with a pretty new pet (his possible sale) speech or the Glue-sniffing Guarantee fairy brake pad sale. The sappy moments in the film contrast sharply with Farley and Spade's shenanigans. Even after many viewings it's still fun to see Farley pour everything he had into the role. Richard what's HAPPENING to me?!?!  ,pos
 Every review I have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point. Shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays. The Scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken. So listen again and note the difference. The play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received polite well- enunciated English. I am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in Leicester unknowingly asked me age 14 to read a piece of Walter Scott which was written in the tone of the Border. I come from the Border and when I read it as it should be read it made all the difference. ,pos
 Dr. Bock teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it. The thing about him is that he is depressed. Dr. Bock and his wife separated his children are deviant he cannot perform in the bedroom and he feels as if he isn't doing a very good job at healing people. He becomes suicidal but meets Barbara who changes his ideas for the better. All around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside. The movie is well done and the character of Dr. Bock is well played out. It's a little sad somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama. It was good to see a couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what Dr. Bock was doing. Great movie. ,pos
 Does anyone care about any of the characters in this film? - Or for that matter what happens to them? - I doubt it. That is the key problem - for a tragedy to work we have to care about at least one of the characters and none of them inspire any sympathy or appear to have any redeeming qualities at all. What may have worked in the 16th Century certainly does not work in one can only assume 'post apocalyptic Liverpool' if that was indeed what it was meant to be. The problem is the characters in post apocalyptic Liverpool whilst still driving around in cars using mobile phones and watching television have reverted to speaking in Shakespearian language - with a Liverpudlian dialect. Oh dear! Bad enough you might think - but this often lapsed into pure scouse - with comments such as 'eh lah are you a cockney? And was that a Merseyrail announcement during one of the scenes filmed in the underground? Well the good news is that in Post apocalyptic Liverpool - the trains are still running. The characters without exception are badly drawn wooden and more like charicatures on the lines of the Joker/Penguin in Batman and Robin except there is no real storyline to speak of - or if there is - it is one that doesn't work in a modern setting where half the sets are gloomy and 'Blade runnerish' and the other half are fluorescent garish or just 21st century normal. Costumes are also mixed up with half wearing their everyday clothes (Parkers are big in post apocalyptic Liverpool - apparently) and the other half wearing costumes from the leftovers of a fancy dress party? The film explores the ideas of lust incest and revenge in the most inane fashion imaginable - the tragedy is that this film was made at all. ,neg
 When I first saw this I thought bits of it were fairly scary. But the horror is a little undermined by the fact that the dozy teenagers are so irritating that you don't really care what happens to them. There are some genuinely good moments such as Angela's speech about demons and the briefly-seen demon itself is effective. But this really doesn't stand up to repeated viewing or close analysis. It's all pretty tacky and cheap-looking and often downright silly pornography and unfunny wisecracks all too often replacing horror. The music is excellent however and the epilogue is certainly amusing but this film doesnt have much to recommend it just comes across as another Jason-type stalk-and-slash fare. ,neg
 Okay first the good thing : If you saw the trailer then you know about 100% of the scary/jumpy moment of the movie. And yes it's a good thing because you should just stick to the trailer and not go see the movie. I now understand why Sarah Michelle Gellar did not stay alive in that movie for very long she did not want to associate her name with this production. I wish her the best for The Return . You have to follow 3 different story in this movie and they are all disconnected (in time and meaning) until the very end. And even then it's a very bad climax. And god forbid even open the door to another sequel. Yes in this movie The Rage and Fury is on the move. No need to visit the house anymore just be close to someone who when inside and you're done. It's not a curse anymore it's kinda like a virus. Go inside the house get scared return back to USA and spread the joy in your apartment building. It's not that difficult to follow but you just don't really care about anyone. The plot line is slim to none and you have many scene in this movie where you just laugh and shake your head... Milk anyone?? I saw Ju-On 2 at the Fantasia movie festival last summer different story completely but much better than this dud. It's not a remake but this time maybe they should have simply done a remake.... If you must see it wait for the DVD. ,neg
 Over 21 the film version of the Ruth Gordon play which detailed her experiences trying to keep the marriage together with Garson Kanin after he'd gone in the service provides Irene Dunne with one of her better later roles on the big screen. It's also in keeping with what was then an upbeat spirit in America about how we would not screw up the peace as we did in the first World War and sow the seeds of yet another global conflict. The play Ruth Gordon wrote and starred in herself ran for 221 performances in 1944 on Broadway and was confined simply to the bungalow that Gordon and Harvey Stephens who was the male lead had on a training base. If you look on the Broadway credits list it says that the production was 'staged' by George S. Kaufman as opposed to being directed by him. I'm not sure of the distinction but I can imagine that with a wit and will as strong as Kaufman's it must have been an interesting period putting the production together before opening night. When Columbia bought the screen rights Sidney Buchman had to do some considerable script reconstruction to move the action beyond the bungalow. The film bears very little trace of its stage origins. Alexander Knox plays the husband and Charles Coburn the employer of both Dunne and Knox who are writers. Knox has graduated to not only editor but featured columnist. His words and thoughts help sell the paper and Coburn is in a bind. But Knox feels he has to get into the war the seminal event of his time in order to speak authoritatively on the kind of post war world he wants. This was not an uncommon theme in those years. Irene Dunne has some good comic moments the kind she used to have when she was appearing opposite Cary Grant. In fact Garson Kanin directed both of them in My Favorite Wife a few years earlier. Coburn is his usual cantankerous old water buffalo of a boss who ultimately has a good heart. Over 21 was an optimistic picture which sad to say wasn't accurate about what the Allies and I mean all of them could bring to the peace conferences to create a better world. Still hopefully a new generation will get it right. ,pos
 It's difficult to make it through this movie without choking on your own vomit to be honest. The shoddy animation doesn't help as it makes this look like a decades-old video you'd find in Morrisons's 99p bin. Still it's better than the abysmal screenplay which spends about a third of its length on superfluous extras like Belle's present day problems stuff about Scrooge's dad and plenty of charmless fannying around with - choke - TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC MICE. These bizarre additions eat up screen time at the expense of elements you'd think would be quite important like Dickens's dialogue and key chunks of his plot - the movie buggers up the game of twenty questions for example and at times fails to put scenes in the right order. Absolutely hopeless. ,neg
 I hope this group of film-makers never re-unites. ,neg
 This movie is really bad. The hero can't play. You see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart. And believe me he walks a lot. For 45 min nothing happens. He only walks to places and gets out..... Like if the story was so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring looks-like-a-suspens scenes. Dialogues are very poor. I counted around a lots of hello's and few hang on on the 1st part. Blood is orange like the Mercurochrome you put on kid's blisters. And scenes are not following themselves. A bloody neck on a scene a clean neck on the following. The story could have been improved. Yeah I mean what the hell is the story? Martial arts? Where? Is that martial arts? Watch how hesitant and slow are the moves!!!!! If giving a kick and receiving a punch is called martial arts then I am Bruce Lee!!!! The only good point I have found is on fight scenes : They don't play with zoom and fast switching scenes that gives you headache in most of action movies. There are plenty of low budget movies that are great. That one was just to make money. Nothing else. ,neg
 i didn't hate this one. i just couldn't adapt to the story. it didn't really grab me. Michael Mann is a very good director but i have to disagree with his methods in this. i'm also a fan of Daniel Day Lewis. some projects he's been in are pretty rubbish but his acting is brilliant. my favourite Daniel Day Lewis films are There Will Be Blood and Gangs Of New York. there is one thing i loved about this and that was the musical score it gave the film a lot of atmosphere. thats about all i liked in it though. this film has a high vote as well which is a bit random. i can see that a fair few people will like this but not enough to make the overall rating 7.8. i would give this film a miss if i was you but there is a lot of high votes for this so i guess you should watch it and make your own views on what you think. i didn't really like it............. 4/10.............j.d Seaton ,neg
 We really don't know where to begin when talking about this movie. But we'll start with the plot. We sincerely suspect that whomever wrote/produced/directed this movie never read the book. Because they missed the entire point. SATIRICAL not horror. Just a hint. Second the bath scene. Enough said. Third the added characters. The sketchy Gothic french lady and her black page who enjoys holding hands and cartwheeling. We don't understand where this came from either. And then there was the casting. All of them were really unlikeable. We were very upset that Catherine and Mr. Tilney ended up together because they were so unlikable that no one would ever wish to see them happy. And...the music. We think that the BBC producers ran out of money so raided their grandmother's attic. And they found some old records. Saxophone wailing female voices and an occasional electric guitar. *shudder* Plus the best line ever: Since you left the white rose bush has died of grief. If anybody has any explanation we would love to hear it. Because it makes absolutely no sense. We are still wondering what on earth everyone involved was thinking when they cruelly released this pathetic excuse of a movie out on the public. We think it should be considered a federal offense. Torture is illegal. This movie is by far the worst we have seen to date. And I've seen a lot of movies. Our recommendation: Give this movie to whomever you hate. They will watch it and want to kill themselves. And we agree with a previous post we would give this 0 stars if at all possible. DO NOT WATCH!! And we strongly suspect that everyone who commented so far in favor of this movie were involved in its production. Or were mentally insane. These are the only reasons we have been able to come up with that would instigate giving a favorable review. ,neg
 The beginning of the movie was confusing and the rest of it was predictable. It was just one of those movies that I came across in my netflix instant queue and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfro and Bijou Phillips team up together again since Bully. Unfortunately interesting never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl at a private school whose best friend is rich and does anything she wants at any time (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the boys (Renfro) from the in crowd and eventually starts hanging with them. And of course like all other movies things are good (or so you assume since the movie never hints on that things are good) and then things become not so good by hanging with the rich kids. The problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. It is just a dead lifeless movie that after you've watched it you feel you could have done anything better. Some scenes (the ones with Renfro's parents) don't even make sense as to being in the movie because the director and writer didn't follow up on it at all. All the interesting things that COULD have played out was just completely ignore and this is almost like watching a before they were stars episode (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison from the OC). The only shining light in this movie and the reason it doesn't get a ONE rating from me is Phillips. They needed more scenes with her in it. Renfro just look like he brought over a bit of his character from Bully. And for pete's sake the Title is BS change the name. ,neg
 Thorn-BMI is out of business before they stopped making films they made a chiller of a movie. Using E.S.P. and telekinesis as the basis of the daughter whose father mastered a terrible power. Only in the death of her father did Olivia find that her father dubbed 'Raymar' from Raymarkovitch had really murdered 6 girls and was planning two more by using the technique of Psyhic Vampirism. Our picture starts with 6 coroner wagons pulling in and music to match the grusome discovery of the 6 girls. Dead all with their eyes wide open in a closet. In the walls were all kinds of objects the coroners men were pulling up an old man when blue lightning hit the ceiling which caused a circular hole to form only made the film more bizarre! If you like extremely chilling scenes this for you. Unless you can see dead bodies from years ago in each level of decay don't view it without a friendly companion. Like The Changeling it has some heart stopping horror in it. I gave this a rating of 7 it's in color actress Meg Tilly debuted in this film if you can find it see it. ,pos
 As listed and stated in many previous comments this unique series has many excellent elements and ingredients to its credit. Indeed more than 20 years after it was originally transmitted it is still watched and watched again and has a huge global fan-following something which must indicate that the makers of this series undeniably got something right. The root of the series' brilliance and remarkable appeal has however got to be that it rests on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters  all of which are brought to life by marvellous actors. The characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity. In contrast to many other Robin Hood adaptations and indeed many other film and TV-productions in general the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have apparent flaws while the baddies although put forward as evil and ruthless frequently can be understood and even on occasion seem quite sympathetic. This very much makes Robin of Sherwood into a story about multifaceted REAL people  rather than of good and bad people  something which very much adds to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. Also although very much being an action-packed series featuring numerous amazing stunts (which are remarkable in themselves seeing as this was made long before today's computer animation green screens and so forth. Thus behind every one of those endless guys falling off castle walls horses and catching fire there actually is a real person who at some point DID fall off a castle wall or a horse or catch fire) there is always amazing dialogue going on between the different characters in each episode. In the final analysis however it is generally the series' baddies  Nickolas Grace as The Sheriff of Nottingham Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne and Philip Jackson as The Abbot Hugo de Rainault  who get the very best lines and who more than often steal the show with their arguments full of wit and cant. It's a wedding not a celebration! is just one of their many timeless pearls of wisdom which seems to follow one through life :-). 20 years after the fact it is indeed hard to believe that Robin of Sherwood was originally something made for television  and apparently not with a great deal of money  in order to provide fleeting Saturday afternoon amusement for small children in Great Britain. Filmed in beautiful locations with clever amazing scripts and featuring remarkable stunts and fantastic actors  many of whom give the performance of their lives in this show  this in numerous ways seems to be more professionally made and have more production value than many a Hollywood film. ,pos
 Looking all of 29 years old Rob Lowe is a detective in charge of a murder investigation. When the husband of a society woman (Leslie Hope) is found dead police suspect the rich chick might have something to do with it. Enter Rob who immediately falls for the pretty widow even though he claims that he's just trying to be 'helpful'. Rob is such a good cop he is able to sneak some of her incriminating love letters into his coat pocket before he accidentally throws them into the fireplace. Monotonous murky drama with an endless drone of background music. This is a good substitute sleeping remedy if you've run out of Sominex. ,neg
 This is the kind of film that I am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning. This is the kind of movie that I cannot understand how people put money in it how the rental store can put the DVD on its shelves. This is the kind of movie I blame myself for having rented it. There are good class-B movies and I do not reject the genre. When they are good they catch the interest with the action they have characters written well enough and acted well enough so that you can care about them. The effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases and you may like them for the originality. Almost nothing is true in 'Coronado'. The subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics - just a cliche. The effects are cheap - and I do not care that the film is low budget - you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent. There are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films. You do not care for the characters you do not laugh and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not. The only quality I could find is the scenery there are some good locations worth a much better film. 2/10 on my personal scale. The worst film of the year so far. ,neg
 This is a truly terrible sci-fi/horror film from 1957. In fact despite Ed Wood Jr.and his dreadful films getting a lot of publicity this turkey is every bit as bad as the worst of Wood. Now the acting is a bit better than you'd find in the Wood epics (such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER) but the special effects managed to be significantly worse than Wood's! However bad movie aficionados will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still excellent viewing. Like a Wood film it's great to watch this crap-fest and laugh along with your friends. The film begins with a scientist flying about doing some testing in his jet. However out of nowhere a UFO streaks by and his report of this over the radio triggers a panic by the Air Force. However later they realized that the UFO didn't appear on the radio and they think the scientist is a nut! But when soon after this planes start disappearing all over they realize there must be something to his sighting. So far the film isn't great but it's watchable. However by the time the horrible flying monster appears you know you're watching a turkey. First through horrid use of stock film and crappy models airplanes keep changing mid-flight. Some may not be bothered by this but with airplane lovers like me seeing an F-80 turning into an F-86 to an F-102 fighter plane made me crazy--especially since the planes look nothing like each other. Second through clever cinematography all you really see of the monster is a ball of fuzz for half the film! This is frustrating and you hope that when you finally do see it clearly it will be worth the wait. Well no such luck!! The monster looks less realistic or scary than the duck from Groucho's You Bet Your Life TV show!! In fact it's significantly less realistic than any of the Japanese giant monsters!! In fact Big Bird from Sesame Street is even a bit scarier and realistic!!! It's just god-awful in every way and might just be the dumbest movie monster in history--about as bad (or worse) as the monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE!!! The bottom line is that this is an absolutely dreadful film that sane people won't like. Bad film fans like me (who are a crazy bunch) will probably love it! All others...be afraid ....be VERY afraid!! FYI--You might notice that some clips in this film are from other sci-fi movies!! I am positive the crashing Washington Monument scene was stolen from EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS but I also saw a couple other scenes that I swear are from other films. What a hack job! ,neg
 I find it hard to believe this could happen at all. We do not know if Justin and Richard were troubled or had committed crimes in the past. The movie seems to imply that they were not in and out of trouble. So the first crime they commit is murder? Just to play and jostle with the cops? How do they pick up any girl and just say you are it? Also Richard seems to strangle the woman with little or no effort nor does the women seem to struggle. Hmmm. This whole concept is really hard to believe. That said let's move on. I found myself really hating these punks and would love to have been present with my shot gun with police tactical ammo and see what their plastic suits do then. As for Cassie who was a victim of Carl Hudson has a horrible time trying to survive. The memory of having been stabbed 17 times by Carl leaves her in an emotional mess. Sandra does a superb acting job. She sure made me believe she was one angry cop. As for solving the crime I thought it was great. This movie kept me planted in my chair. Loved the acting of all but Sam. He had no get-up and go. The one thing this movie did not need was the love scene or should I say the rape scene. ,pos
 Both Jackie and Candice are terrific in this movie. They are well-suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular the way Candice pronounces the words Puerto Rican is very funny as she is being kind as she can be but condescending at the same time. I had seen the original of this movie called Old Acquaintance starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They allegedly did not get along so because the movie is about female friendship that might have been a problem. Here the actresses clearly admire and respect each other. Hart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supporting parts and are both excellent in particular Bochner who never got many decent parts in movies as far as I am concerned. George Cukor did not make another movie after this so this was a good one to go out on. ,pos
 I thought it was an excellent movie. Gary Cole played the role of a military man who feels trapped and unhappy with his wife who fakes his death fabulously! Over all I thought the movie was great definitely not a boring plot line! It's sad to say but I think lots of men might feel this way. I think he should have just gotten a divorce and asked to be transferred instead of the extreme he went to but he felt there was no other way out so he faked his death. I thought it was neat that Cole's real-life wife played the wife he was unhappy with in the movie. I think what the guy did was alittle extreme but the movie was great nonetheless! Definitely recommend it! ,pos
 An extremely powerful film that certainly isn't appreciated enough. It's impossible to describe the experience of watching it. The recent UK television adaptation was shameful - too ordinary and bland. This original manages to imprint itself in your memory. ,pos
 It's 1913. A studio prop boy spies the actress who is going to become Hollywood's next great movie star and he's the director that's going to make it happen. After inventing pie throwing and the keystone cops his dream comes true. Being completely absorbed in his film-making however he fails to notice that he is losing his leading lady to another man. Several over-budget flops later he is known as nothing more than the director who turned down Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him the loyal and compassionate residents of Hollywood are untainted by ambition and ego. He'll be okay as long as he still has his friends. This movie starts out as a mad-cap comedy typical of the time period and in the opening scenes it holds its own with the best of them. It has a playful lack of self-consciousness which is sorely missing in most of today's comedies. Shortly into the film however it moves away from this mode of comedy and instead attempts to entertain us using the films within the film. These are silent slapstick comedies well done but nothing out of the ordinary and they go on for much longer than is necessary for any audience which has seen the originals. Upon returning the film takes a dramatic turn. It's well written and the cast does an excellent job of making the transition but the movie really should have decided from the beginning what it was going to be. By the end of the film it has transformed once again - this time into a paean to the glitter of Hollywood. The small town of Los Angeles has grown up into the city which makes the movies that entertain the whole world. In spite of its promising beginnings this film has not aged particularly well. Nevertheless it does have some strong scenes a certain nostalgic appeal and an entertaining sub-text about the people who made it and the audiences it was made for. ,pos
 As Muppet movies go this is easily and clearly the best. It features loads of cameos by big named comedic stars of the age a solid script and some great Disneyesque songs and blends them together in a culmination of the best display of Henson's talent. The story is basic and the jokes are many-leveled in order to amuse both the adults and the kids to which this was marketed without exposing them to ideologies their parents may not find desirable. This is simply fun but it is also a well made well written beautifully endearing classic. It rates an 8.9/10 from... the Fiend :. ,pos
 At first it seems the topical romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love but the point is that this movie has a feeling others don't have.The first time i saw it i couldn't see it complete because i had to leave.But while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didn't have any opportunity by then.One year went by until i saw this movie in a not-free channel and i saw it and i recorded it too.I saw it once twice...until 200 times and not kidding.I did know all the dialogues by hart and i don't know why but i saw it everyday and never got bored.And i have to say that I'm not used to see a movie more than twice.The act is very good.Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too.I would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it.On balance it's a movie i can't take out of my mind. ,pos
 One of the most charming and for me at least the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's enthralling Best Picture-winner The English Patient is that in the mid 90s when Hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects a film was created that brought back tracesvery powerful tracesof the sweeping wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and The Ten Commandments (1956). The English Patient contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all and fascinating characters with pasts and stories. The English Patient based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje is like The Godfather: Part II (1974) in the sense of how it's constructed. It's a blending of two stories: the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the post years of World War Two. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient who has been scarred for life by a plane crash and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced troubled patient Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other. That's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other one told in flashback is the patient's past before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever. To be blunt The English Patient is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate how obsessive how enchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in love stories such as Minghella's later Cold Mountain (2003) the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love but still because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion we can believe that there is a sure true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of Vertigo (1958) in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other. Performances all around were great. I was especially enthralled by the performance by Juliette Binoche who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe playing the sort of cynical questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing. And of course I can't leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers. Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect film. There are two flaws that I cannot glance over. Number one it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly in there but in the film it just seems a littledistracting and the relationship between the two characters didn't fascinate me. I was far more interested by Fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses. Nevertheless these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit. Those put aside The English Patient is an extraordinary achievement of film-making. To me it was sort of like an insane mix up between Casablanca (1942) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962) two remarkable and better films and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time. It is a real shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. For he was a truly gifted filmmaker. This is all the evidence anybody needs. ,pos
 Ocean's 12 'If you steal fifty million dollars they will find you.' (Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber Die Hard) This adage certainly rings true in this sequel. Terry Benedict has been informed that Danny Ocean and his compadres were the ones who ripped him off and now he wants it all back. The Ocean gang need a lot of money and fast but cannot work in the states as Benedict has made it impossible for them. So it's off to Europe to perform acts of death defying thievery whilst trying to avoid Catherine Zeta Jones' super cop an old flame from Rusty's (Pitt's) past. On their first heist in Amsterdam they find out that who ratted on them was the 'Night Fox' a super slick thief with a legend complex. He issues them with a challenge that could write off their debt in full or land them in some kind of Uma Thurman-Kill Bill II-buried-alive-type-sequence. Interesting? Well yes. Slow? Sort of. Entertaining? Mostly. Unnecessary scenes of character development? Plenty. Ocean and his band of merry men are charismatic if nothing else and as this is a sequel and we are all old friends we see plenty more 'pally' situations and conversations. Too many. Damon's Linus is more nervous than before; the cousins are bickering as we knew they would; Bernie Mac talks too much and Don Cheadle's cock-er-ney accent is as bad as ever (I really like Cheadle but could not abide this). Pitt and Clooney talk like old friends filling each other's glasses and reading each other's minds. However what worked so well in the last film was the lack of character development versus how slick the whole damned op was. And as much as these actors work well together Zeta Jones fits into this film like a big square peg in a tight 11 sided hole. She simply doesn't fit and her chemistry with Pitt is non-existent. The stars of this film for me however were Vincent Cassel as the Night Fox and Soderbergh's choice of locations. Cassel plays pomp and wealth as if he was born into both. His Night Fox is arrogant 'awfully cavalier with other people's lives' (Danny Ocean) and a total contrast to the Ocean gang. This is where I think the film loses its way. Cassel and the European locations provide an all too realistic contrast with the American actors and the style of the first film. We want slick brash and quick-witted; not gritty considered and intellectual. This is where the film doesn't work. Admittingly you cannot repeat the same formula twice to the letter but going to far left or right usually does more damage than good in a mainstream film like this. ,pos
 This movie is a fine example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a fine movie out of the gates at all cost. Only with this movie it truly is a near miss. Everything seems in place for Robocop 2 to be a worthy followup to the groundbreaking first movie. The complete original cast (apart from the casualties naturally) returns and gives it their best. Too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as good as neutralize their efforts. Irvin Kershner might have been the ideal go to guy for George Lucas to direct the Empire Strikes Back. For a pedestrian filmmaker like Kershner there isn't much to ruin in Lucas' charmless film series. A worthy successor to a classic like Robocop would have needed either Paul Verhoeven to return or a director with enough brass to give his own spin on it. Kershner doesn't know how to give his own spin on anything (Lucas hired him for that) and he's surely no Verhoeven. So what we get here is a movie that goes through all the motions to replicate the first movie but with none of the freshness humor or daring the original had. Kershner probably thought he could top Verhoeven by adding more gore and gratuitous violence but instead he reveals how much he was at work as a director for hire instead of a passionate filmmaker. And that's a shame since everything was in place to make this another classic. As mentioned the actors give it their best but Phill Tippet delivers some groundbreaking stop motion effects and there are some great ideas in the story by Frank Miller who was born to write a Robocop movie. If only the studio had hired a director who was competent enough to make all the potential come through. ,neg
 This movie is absolutely terrible... Definately a bull***t story and even worse acting. Too bad Charlie Sheen is involved in something like this since he is a decent actor and has done a couple of really good movies. The special effects are 'A-team'-standard with the classical car gets shot and then flips over with a little fireball under the hood. Of course the enemy are portrayed as total idiots and die as fast as they can say '-Die evil Americans'. Unless braindead movies are you game don't spend 113minutes of your life on this rubbish. Pick up 'the Platoon' or 'Apocalypse Now' instead. ,neg
 I caught this filmshow about the most unlikely success? from a lower league football team. The plot is thick and roles out some great tenuous twists and turns. Intercut with shots and commentary from the 70's .I was taken aback by its shear footy fun. A great cast includes the excellent Tim Healy as the crazed(drunk) manager bumbling along hanging on to anything that will make his team win...? I keep remembering bits such as the stolen secret file that Don Revie( Super leeds united and england manager-loved by the fans hated by everyone else)has on Bostock United ( the underfelt men) which in its detailed report of their opposition Bostock United in this the FA Cup final merely says Sh-te . Lots of other footy gags a long time before the fantastic feature length Mike Basset - Football Manager Starring Ricky Tomlinson. Up there with the Gung ho English beating Germans at football. Well morally.Although the score lines says different of Escape to Victory ( I still cheer when England score ) And the thankless eternal grind of following a really bad team in Micheal Palins Golden Gordon from Ripping Yarns series ( with Terry Jones)the team were called Bostonworth United in case your interested. I've looked high and low for a copy of Bostock's Cup-even Nick Hancock's biography doesn't list it ( probably someone -not mr hancocks- error) Play it again or sell me a copy- PLEASE.... ,pos
 THE HAND OF DEATH most definitely rates a ten on a scale of one to- due in no small part to John Woo's masterful direction coupled with Kat's superb cinematography: some of the leisurely tracking shots alone are worth the price of a rental; there are moments when this one borders on becoming an art-house film. Both James Tien and Sammo Hung make for the kind of villains you can't help but love to hate. Tien is particularly good as the baddest of the bad. It's a role reversal the likes of which I don't think I've ever seen before (Tien normally played a hero and in fact with his moustache I didn't even recognize him at first). Sammo's goofy buck teeth only make an already unsavory character seem even more flawed; that he also happens to be a skilled martial artist makes him even less likable- in a villain you love to hate kind of way. His choreography of the fight scenes throughout is fantastic. Jackie Chan appears briefly (early on and late in the going) as a blacksmith and I believe I actually glimpsed Yuen Biao somewhere along the way. Tan as the lead is nothing less than magnificent. ,pos
 I was pulled into this movie early on much to my surprise because I hadn't intended to watch it at all. Now I wish I hadn't. The suspense starts out well with the hit-and-run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess or be found out or (doable now though a no-no in the old days of movie-making) get away with it. The plot's been done before--what plot hasn't--but the tensions inherent in it with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair make for an absorbing first half. Then the film abandons the hit-and-run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited all-suffering loves. The two tracks of plot--hit-and-run and unreasoning love--just don't have enough to do with each other and that they involve the same characters doesn't bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. The screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. At the end of the film in the midst of the movie's second funeral I found myself thinking Now what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run? The filmmakers may think the answer obvious but I think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily. ,neg
 I rented this movie because the DVD cover made it look like it was going to be a ridiculous college comedy like van wilder or animal house. I took it to my friend house to watch for movie night. We ended up stopping it 15 minutes into the film and watched Copper Mountain instead. I don't know if any of you have seen Copper Mountain but it isn't great either. However I would have to say that the Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo made it a more enjoyable watch. I later finished Puddle Cruiser. This movie was slow and the humor was forced. This movie reminded me of some stinkers that I saw in some of my earlier production classes in college. I was left wondering was this the film that enabled Broken Lizard to make Supertroopers? Also how could this movie suck so bad? Supertroopers was good and Club Dread was decent. Don't see this movie! ,neg
 In 1965 producer Kevin McLory -who owns a part of the Bond cinematic rights- associate with EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) for making Thunderball the fourth film of the 007 franchise. The star is Sean Connery of course. In 1982 McLory wins a legal battle and can produce an independent Bond film. Never say never again (NSNA) is one of the two unofficial 007 films made outside EON (the other is the 1967 comedy spoof Casino Royale ). NSNA is a remake of Thunderball and stars the original Bond Sean Connery -who comes back to the role after many years of absence. The film is released some months after Octopussy with Roger Moore the 13th episode of the EON series. At the time press calls it War of the Bonds ... Both films are a big success in 1983 even if Octopussy earns more money at the box office. NSNA is a luxurious film made by excellent technicians -director Irvin Kershner who led The Empire strikes back Douglas Slocombe -cinematographer of Raiders of the lost Ark - and screenwriter Lorenzo Semple Jr -who wrote The three days of the Condor - among others... The cast is excellent with Connery a then relatively unknown Kim Basinger Barbara Carrera Klaus Maria Brandauer Max Von Sydow Edward Fox... Although all that the film remains inferior to the original Thunderball . It lacks many fundamental ingredients for being a real Bond movie: there's not the traditional gun barrel sequence there's not the James Bond theme M and Q are not played by the traditional actors... It's a copyright reason: EON only is allowed to use these elements. Briefly NSNA lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere. On the other hand the film is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and gorgeous. But the main highlight is Sean Connery! He's once again wonderful in the role he's older but looks fitter and nicer here than in Diamonds are forever his last performance in the role of the British super-spy before NSNA. ,pos
 A group of obnoxious teens go to a former funeral parlor for a Halloween party. They get trapped inside and become possessed by demons that they have accidentally awakened. The possessed teens start killing the others off and seem to be led by Angela (Mimi Kinkade) who floats and talks in a really deep voice. The remaining teens that haven't been possessed yet are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house. This is a pretty decent horror film with great special effects which include Linnea Quigley (who has a couple nude scenes as usual) gouging out a guy's eyeballs and pushing a tube of lipstick into her nipple. There's also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy getting his tongue bitten out. This is a great film to watch with a bunch of friends late at night while eating some pizza. The terrible acting and atrocious dialog almost ruins it though. Overall I would give it a 7 out of 10. ,pos
 In many ways the filmic career of independent film-making legend John Cassavetes is the polar opposite of someone like Alfred Hitchcock the consummate studio director. Where Hitchcock infamously treated his actors as cattle Cassavetes sought to work with them improvisationally. Where every element in a Hitchcock shot is composed immaculately Cassavetes cared less for the way a scene was figuratively composed than in how it felt or what it conveyed emotionally. Hitchcock's tales were always plot-first narratives with the human element put in the background. Cassavetes put the human experience forefront in every one of his films. If some things did not make much sense logically so be it. One can see this even from his very first film 1959's Shadows filmed with a 16mm hand-held camera on a shoe string budget of about $40 000 in Manhattan with Cassavetes' acting workshop repertory company and touted as an improvisatory film. The story is rather simple as it follows the lives of three black sibling Manhattanites- Benny (Ben Carruthers)- a trumpeter and no account Hugh (Hugh Hurd)- a washed up singer and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni)- the younger sister of both. The film's three main arcs deal with Hugh's failures as a nightclub crooner and his friendship with his manager Rupert (Rupert Crosse); Benny's perambulations in an about Manhattan with his two no account pals; and Lelia's lovelife- first with a white boy Tony (Anthony Ray) who does not realize light-skinned Lelia's race even after bedding her; then with stiff and proper Davey (Davey Jones) who may be a misogynist. In the first arc nothing much happens except dark-skinned Hugh gets to pontificate on how degraded he feels to be singing in low class nightclubs and opening shows for girly acts. He dreams of making it big in New York or even Paris but one can tell he is the type of man who will continue deluding himself of his meager skill for the one time we actually get to hear him sing he shows he's a marginal talent at best. That Rupert keeps encouraging him gives us glimpses into how destructive friendships work. But this is the least important of the three arcs. While this film is better overall than say Martin Scorsese's first film a decade later Who's That Knocking At My Door?- another tale of failed romance and frustrated New Yorkers it has none of the brilliant moments- acting-wise nor cinematographically- that that film has. It also is not naturalistic for naturalism in art is a very difficult thing to achieve especially in film although the 1950s era Manhattan exteriors at ground level is a gem to relive. While Shadows may indeed be an important film in regards to the history of the independent film circuit it certainly is nowhere near a great film. Parts of it are preachy poorly acted scenes end willy-nilly almost like blackout sketches and sometimes are cut off seemingly in the middle. All in all it's a very sloppy job- especially the atrocious jazz score that is often out of synch with the rest of the film as Cassavetes proved that as a director at least in his first film he was a good actor. The only reason for anyone to see Shadows is because Cassavetes ultimately got better with later films and this gives a clue as to his later working style. The National Film Registry has rightly declared this film worthy of preservation as 'culturally significant'. This is all in keeping with the credo of art Cassavetes long championed as typified by this quote: 'I've never seen an exploding helicopter. I've never seen anybody go and blow somebody's head off. So why should I make films about them? But I have seen people destroy themselves in the smallest way. I've seen people withdraw. I've seen people hide behind political ideas behind dope behind the sexual revolution behind fascism behind hypocrisy and I've myself done all these things. So I can understand them. What we are saying is so gentle. It's gentleness. We have problems terrible problems but our problems are human problems.' That this film is 'culturally significant' is true but that truth is not synonymous with its being 'artistically significant'. It is in the difference between these two definitions where great art truly thrives. ,pos
 An interesting look at the immigrant experience told as a fable with some very weird imagery. I got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily who traveled to America. I imagine much the same as my Grandfather did at that time. Travelling in steerage to provide ballast for the ships I cannot imagine it was very comfortable as shown in this film. Laws restricting immigrants existed. I would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free from contagious diseases or hereditary infirmities. In the film we see physical and mental exams the latter because of the view that low intelligence is heritable. Single women could not enter the country on the presumption that they would become prostitutes so most married single men already in the country as arranged beforehand at Ellis Island before entry. This is the story of a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who arranges to marry a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He is trying to get his family through with a son that is mute and a mother (Aurora Quattrocchi) that is considered feeble-minded. She was fantastic in the role by the way. You will also see character actor Vincent Schiavelli in his next to the last appearance. I don't know if his last film has been released. He plays a matchmaker and is also very good. It was a strange but enjoyable film. It's not for everyone as I imagine those who don't have some interest in the immigrant experience would find it rather slow. ,pos
 SPOILER AHEAD! The mummy (Lon Chaney Jr.) is on the loose in a New England college town searching for a college student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of his beloved Princess Ananka. Dull slow (even at 65 minutes--it moves slower than the mummy!) indifferently acted but the ending is worth waiting for. The mummy gets the girl (!!!!!) and she ages rapidly as the both slowly sink in a swamp. This is (I believe) the only time in a Universal monster movie that the monster got the girl! That aside this is stricly amateur night. Probably the worst of the mummy sequels--and that's saying something! ,neg
 Footprints is a very interesting movie that is somewhat difficult to categorize. Psychological thriller is the most appropriate description I can think of. The female protagonist Alice Cespi discovers that she doesn't remember anything of the last three days. The only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel. She is also haunted by a recurring very vivid dream about a science fiction movie that she believes she saw many years ago. In her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesn't trust anyone but little by little it becomes obvious that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before. This is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events will unfold and particularly how it will end. The unusual loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of everyone else ensure that the good old paranoid feeling is present throughout the film whereas beautiful colors and some spectacularly filmed sequences make this a visually attractive movie as well. The important part of the one and only Nicoletta Elmi everyone's all time favorite redheaded obnoxious child star of Italian horror is an extra bonus. ,pos
 As a sci-fi and casual Angelina Jolie fan I thought this obviously low-budget movie might be worth a look... maybe it had a few scenes or a storyline that would make up for all its other faults. Plus it might be interesting to watch Angelina as she was embarking on her star-bound career. Oh how wrong I was. One thing I learned -- at 18 Angelina Jolie couldn't act. So to make her comfortable the producers cast this entire movie with people who couldn't act. Seeing this Jack Palance (who can actually act) decided to overact. Watching 10 minutes of this happen is enough to burn your eyes out. To the horrible acting and overacting add a nonsensical script insipid dialog bottom-of-the-barrel cinematography... in fact add bottom-of-the-barrel everything. The story features Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin. She escapes the corporate HQ with the help of her combat instructor. The corporation sends bounty hunters after them. Stupid stuff happens. The end. I would tell you more but I didn't want to waste my life watching this dreck. I implore you -- this is not worth watching. Its not even worth thinking about watching. Save yourself the pain and move on. ,neg
 I walked into the movie theater with no expectations for the film I was about to witness Everything is Illuminated . I walked out with a joy I have barely come to feel with American films. The directorial debut of actor Leiv Schreiber the film follows a man on his journey through the past accompanied by an eccentric group including a brake-dancing barely English-speaking punk from the Eukraine his grandfather who believes he is blind and their crazy dog. The first half of the film is funny and smart with an extremely European flavor in the usage of small but wonderful characters while the second half of the film descends into a somber story of discovery and the holocaust. This little movie brings out so many emotions and so many colors with such a wonderful conclusion and is more than just a story of illumination but also of relationships and connections. The acting is incredibly powerful the story mysterious and interesting and the artistic appeal of the cinematography to die for. With some brilliant and absolutely touching scenes Everything is Illuminated managed to capture my heart. ,pos
 It would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun: a call girl gets shot in the forehead by a North Korean spy but survives. The bullet that is embedded in her brain makes her long for knowledge as well as sex. Unbeknownst to her she walks away from the shooting with the cloned finger of George W. Bush in her purse a key which can unlock the power to use nuclear armaments. Just call it a romp and at least a few people will show up to the theater. I'm not sure how many did go to see this four year old film when it opened in New York this past April but I sincerely hope not many. It sounds like a light and playful pinku flick but it has art-house pretensions and is really just incredibly boring. Many pinku films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations but this film's aspirations just make the time that elapses between the sex scenes excruciating. And then the sex scenes aren't even good! I've seen some pretty outrageous stuff in dirty Japanese movies. I've never seen this country produce something with sex this dull. The Spice Channel is more imaginative. The only worthwhile thing in this movie is the body of the lead actress Emi Kuroda. Otherwise this is pure torture. ,neg
 Okay first of all I missed like the first 15 minutes of the movie so I missed credits and stuff. SO when I finally got to it I was like Who the hell is this dude? . I found out it was Flex like hours after watching the movie. Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson. Not one bit. He couldn't dance like him or move like him the only thing he almost had was the voice. People commented on Elizabeth Taylor but I can't really comment on that because I don't know much about her. The whole movie was like just plain wack. The dialogue sucked. The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked. The soundtrack sucked. The acting sucked. Yes even Flex...I'm so upset about it though. I didn't want it to suck. I'm so sad that Flex got told he can get away with it. But the whole thing looked like dress-up. You know? It's like nobody looked like they were supposed to except for Joseph Jackson. The concert sequences just sucked. I'm sorry but Flex just can't dance like Michael. I mean like what the hell was VH1 thinking? The makeup didn't even match like the time of whatever Michael was going through. For example in the movie he was still dark when Neverland got raided the first time around. In real life MJ was white as hell. There was some sort of stupid delay in his skin discoloring. The movie wasn't boring well for me it wasn't. It wasn't really anything. I was just so upset about everything that was wrong with it. I wanted to see how it turned out and if Flex could redeem himself. He didn't really. The only part I found like a bit interesting was the whole Lisa Marie thing. When they fell in love. That was nice. But I had to turn my face away when they kissed. Heh. And only two parts made me collapse with laughter. The first time was when they cut from Michael with short hair you know the Thriller era to Michael with long flowing hair from the Dangerous era AND HE WAS STILL BLACK! That was funny. The second time I laughed was when they showed all of the posters and memorabilia of Michael but they had Flex's face instead! It was so funny. Overall this movie was cheap trash. It was simply two hours of dress-up and could have been so much better. But no VH1 is cheap. Watch if you want. But this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it. I came out of it feeling angry. And when I found out it was Flex I just started to feel so bad. So...watch if you want. ,neg
 Rebecca De Mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress but as for the parts she's given to play if you cannot say something nice... De Mornay portrays a woman who had terrible traumas as a child with a father she can hardly stand now that she's a grown up and has become a -of course brilliant- shrink.She has an affair with Banderas whom we suspect of being (ouch!how original!) a serial killer.Sometimes she recalls Banderas's mother-in-law Tippi Hedren's character in Marnie .But I wouldn't count on it:Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago and a lot of regents desperately try to replace him .Here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end but that ending is so far-fetched it is absolutely impossible to buy it.The movie includes the obligatory conversations with a serial killer in the silence of the lamb tradition murders (human beings and cats) split personality and open ending in case the crowds should call for more.Apparently they did not and they were right. ,neg
 Mike Nichols in finest form. I was not a fan of Closer so it's refreshing to see him again right back on top with this comedy set in the darkest of circumstances. Just one slip in tone could have wrecked this compelling picture but Nichols and his very strong A-list cast never put a foot wrong in this biopic of a deeply flawed but utterly compelling Congressman. Philip Seymour Hoffman as usual is scintillating and brilliant - here playing a damaged but ultra-smart CIA manipulator and it is in the exchanges between Hanks and Hoffman's characters where the comedy soars. Rarely is movie humour laugh-out loud and also smart... This hits the spot time after time with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and weep at the state of the world (often simultaneously). One other major plus is the length of the picture. The film is based on George Crile's fat book of the same title. The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his claim to fame is The West Wing ) must have been to make a fat movie but what we get is a breath-taking 90 odd minutes of great story with sweeping implications. This film deserves to be seen and to be recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of dark subject matter and the lightness of touch of it's sparkling witty script - even if it does flunk the obvious link between the help that Herring and Wilson provide and the ultimate consequences (9/11). ,pos
 The story was well plotted and interesting by itself. However it is difficult for me to write the review of this film without spoiling you. To avoid that I am not going to talking the story here. I regard this film as a good adaption of Sarah Water's book as compared with the previous one Tipping the velvet . I read the book first and then watched the DVD later. The film did retain most of spirits of the main characters in the book. Of course due to the time limitation the film in the last 30 min seemed to be in a rush to cover the part III of the book. Therefore it couldn't illustrate well the scene when they all met in the the kitchen of Mr. Ibbs's place and those after that (even the book seemed to me to be a rush on that kitchen scene). Despite that the film actually did a good job in representing the story. It really worth watching. It's still unclear when BBC-America can broadcast this film. That's pity. PS: noticed that the ages of Maud and Sue were set to be 20-21 instead of 17-18 in the book; the latter is more reasonable while the former is more close to the ages of actresses. ,pos
 This movie was so awful so boring so badly miscast -- it took a lot of work to make what should have been a sure thing into such a travesty. I love Lucille Ball but she absolutely stunk in this movie. Too old couldn't sing sounded like a truck dumping gravel even when NOT singing -- and the biggest sin of all -- SHE WASN'T FUNNY. EVEN A LITTLE. The studio shot themselves in the foot with this one and for ruining what should have been a fabulous screen version of a fabulous stage musical some other body parts deserve to have been wounded as well -- or perhaps they were already lacking those parts. That might explain it. But for Lucy to think she was right for a part that required SINGING -- well that's the saddest thing of all. It's a very good thing to know your limitations. Even a legend can't come out of a stinker like this and still smell like a rose. ,neg
 I've always liked Sean Connery but as James Bond I've always favored Roger Moore. Still it was Connery who set the Bond standard and while he had by 1983 established himself as something other than James Bond the money must have been irresistible for him to make one more appearance as 007 and save the world from the evil designs of Spectre. And what designs they are in Never Say Never Again. SPECTRE with the help of a foolish young Air Force officer who happens to be Kim Bassinger's brother stole two nuclear missiles during a war games exercise and now SPECTRE headed by Blofeld played here by Max Von Sydow is threatening blackmail of the world. Von Sydow's operations guy is Klaus Maria Brandauer who is also courting Bassinger and is a bit on the crazy side. And he's got a female assassin working for him in Barbara Carrera who makes Angelina Jolie as Nora Croft look like Mrs. Butterworth. But before Sean Connery can even get started he's got to deal with a new 'M' running things at British Intelligence. Edward Fox thinks Connery is old fashioned in his methods and costs the British taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. I really did enjoy Fox's performance he's like the great grandson of Colonel Blimp. I also enjoyed Carrera she's something to look at and quite resourceful in her methods. When she's scuba diving with Connery in the Bahamas note how she puts Mr. Shark on 007's case. Will Connery do James Bond again? He was widely quoted as saying who would they cast him as at this point Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair. ,pos
 The film begins in Latvia just after WWI. Being a history teacher I knew that multinational troops occupied much of Russia during this time. There was serious concern about the spread of Bolshevism and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their nations' interests. However some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the Communist army as the nations involved really wanted to see the so-called Whites win. However the Whites were deeply factionalized--some wanting the return of a czar some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between. Because of these mixed goals and a lack of a real commitment by the foreign armies the whole expedition was doomed and left the USSR after only a year or two. However what I did NOT know was that German troops were also involved. This surprised me as they had just lost WWI and weren't in the best shape to be mounting such an expedition. This is the backdrop for the film but it's also about a pro-Communist rich lady and her ill-fated love for a childhood friend who is among the German troops. She throws herself at him repeatedly but in each case he rebuffs her. So she then sublimates these desires by various affairs. While none of this sex is all that graphic this and the underlying reason the man isn't interested make this a rather adult film and one I wouldn't show to younger audiences. While the setting for this film is interesting the overall film is as gray and lifeless as any I have seen. I don't recommend it unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are really into overrated German films. I especially warn away anyone who suffers with depression as it will no doubt make it worse. The simple fact is that there are so many better German films out there waiting to be seen--such as MOSTLY MARTHA DAS BOOT MOTHER KUSTERS GOES TO HEAVEN WINGS OF DESIRE or ALI FEAR EATS THE SOUL (among others). ,neg
 The Vietnam War era is certainly far before my time but it has always interested me and I have seen many films about it. All of the others I'd seen had dealt strictly with the front-line of battle. When I read a description of The War At Home I found the concept intriguing. No Vietnam War movie I'd ever heard of talked about what happens to a soldier once the fighting is over with. One night while flipping through channels the movie aired on The Sundance Channel. I set down the remote and settled back to watch it. I did not move from my seat during the entire two hours; it's one of those movies that keeps you very interested because there is no way to predict what is going to happen next. This movie made me a huge fan of Emilio Estevez. I had enjoyed him very much as Billy the Kid in the Young Guns movies but I never saw anything he did afterward. Emilio proved to be very talented at writing and directing as well as acting. The pacing of the movie is done extremely well. I am hard-pressed to think of a point where it drags. What amazes me is that it didn't get an Oscar or any real recognition when it came out. It is a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not who he used to be and probably will never be as they remembered him again. Definitely worth seeing. ,pos
 This film IS brilliant...... without a doubt. Watched it a while ago after constant pestering from family members who are right into their sci-fi films (which I am not) and thought it was quite good. But after recently watching a few documentaries on outer-space etc we watched it again... and it IS good. Kevin Spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski Blown Away Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. Yeah right you think... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth. That is how the story evolves with Bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with Prot (as he is known) his own psychiatric colleagues his wife and family his brother-in-law and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues (who after getting some data from Prot pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth!) A great film... that get's you wondering..... 8/10 Dave ,pos
 The acting was bad and the plot well i don't think there was one. Some fat blonde chap who is always dressed in a dinner suit kidnaps a sort from a nightclub i think he then kills a copper. pointless fights then happen Kidnapped girl is put in cage on a boat why? Tough uncompromising martial arts trained cop turns up speaks bad english and does stuff that does not make sense. Its utter tripe. But he does have a nice car. christ on a bike this film was a waste of 90 minutes. ,neg
 This is a big disappointment. The main problem is the acting. Sylvestre le Touzel is pretty poor as Fanny and the rest are not much better everybody is very stilted and unnatural. Also the camerawork is very 1980's ie cramped and jumpy compared with the likes of 1995's P&P for example. The script is if anything too faithful to the book and there are some cringe worthy expressions that should have been cut. In every way this is far inferior to the recent film version which though it took huge liberties with the book seemed far more faithful to the spirit of the book and was far more enjoyable. ,neg
 Although this film is set amongst the sophisticated English upper classes it is a simple story of a couple torn asunder. It has a slightly dated air being an adaptation of A Way Through the Wood a 1950 novel by Nigel Balchin (once hugely popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes who despite an academy award for the script of Gosford Park has a somewhat anachronistic persona himself wrote the script and directed (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version I saw there is a most illuminating audio commentary by Julian. His primary focus was on getting his characters right and by and large he has succeeded. In this he was helped by two outstanding performances from Tom Wilkinson as James the stitched up City lawyer and Emily Watson as his attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short; the running time is only 80 minutes. James and Anne have a town house in Chelsea and a comfortable former vicarage in Buckinghamshire. Anne is some years younger but they are childless. Outwardly they seem happy but James one of nature's moralists (unusual for a city lawyer) is a control freak. Just down the road is the aristocratic the Hon. William Buel who is not one for middle-class morality and he is more than happy to take advantage. But there's a complication a road accident in which an elderly cyclist is knocked over in a country lane by a ruthlessly driven Range Rover just like the Hon. Bill's. Soon James Anne Bill and the victim's widow (who happens to be James' and Anne's cleaner) are drawn in to a conspiracy to conceal what really happened. The primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all this on James and Anne's relationship. The third person in this ménage a trios Bill is played by Rupert Everett. From the point of view of casting his languid superior manner is right for the part yet somehow he doesn't quite get there. Partly this is because he is supposed to be sick for some of the time and he looks well when he is supposed to be sick and vice-versa. The part seems underdeveloped. It is interesting that John Neville as Bill's father who has only one significant scene manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he has. The world of five star hotels and superior restaurants is nicely evoked. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary these people are able to convince themselves that the Edwardian age still exists. At bottom though the film is about what draws a couple together and what tears them apart. Nigel Balchin was going through a marriage break-up when he wrote the book and Fellowes has made a good fist of conveying the atmosphere. As he says his is a fairly free adaptation but the central theme is the same. ,pos
 I've enjoyed this movie ever since I was a kid and I still do. I also liked Batman forever back then but the real difference is that THIS movie didn't date when I grew up. I did notice a few scenes in this film that didn't make any sense like: 'Hhmm... the crowd is angry. Hey! Where did they get those tomatoes from?' Then I thought: 'who cares? This movie is not 100% serious anyway!' The original Tim Burton Batman was great as well but it was a bit cheesy at some parts and I didn't like all the actors. This movie improved on almost every aspect with a wonderful cast a more Gothic style and no involvement of Prince. Nowadays many fans of the Christopher Nolan movies dislike Burton claiming that the Nolan movies are more serious and therefore more loyal to the comics. I don't think this is entirely true: -There has never been an adaptation of the original concept of Batman which was a vengeful criminal killer with a gun. -Batman has taken many forms over the years peeking its silliness in the 60's (and a bit with Batman & Robin). A director is free to choose what kind of Batman he's going to portray as long if it's good. My opinion: Batman doesn't necessarily have to be serious. It's about a man in a rubber suit with pointy ears. Burton managed to create a perfect balance between the silliness and the darkness surrounding the whole idea. I just recently watched the Nolan movies and I love those ones as well (especially The Dark Knight). There's simply something about this movie that interests me more. Nolan's goal was to give the character much more depth and in doing so he looked for an explanation of nearly every aspect of Batman. That's a bit too much for me I'm a bigger fan of the more abstract version of Batman. The Burton movies are more theatrical and centered around the atmosphere. My conclusion is that you shouldn't compare the Nolan with the Burton movies. They're just different and it's up to you to decide which one you like better. My respect is for both directors. ,pos
 While the prominent and over use of the play-like format is in total operation throughout the film it is not however this that lets this picture down. Rather it is the unconvincing female performances and rather tedious script that the film so obviously relied on a little too much. With an idea that had potential the simple plot is diminished still by Graham's failure to truly express the devastation her character so adamantly claims to experience. The use of improvised scenes by all the actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege. As Downey Jr proves as usual what a gifted actor he is he shadows the two actresses in their scenes together which is constantly noticeable. The pointless yet intense sex scene seems merely to exist in order to prevent the film from being too verbally expressive giving the actors a much deserved break from talking. With an unsatisfying conclusion Two Girls and a Guy has very little to recommend it other than Downey Jr's formidable if not out of place performance. ,neg
 OK here is the deal. I love action movies and generally have no problem suspending a great deal of disbelief over plot holes or other implausible actions. However this movie went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous. Let me get this straight. The police send a notorious gangster and cop killer (along with a number of other prisoners) on a bus with a grand total of two guards. They then are forced to stop at a precinct where precisely two cops are working one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burn out. Apparently the building was about to be shut down so somehow the police decided that everyone else in the entire precinct got the night off for new year's eve. Right. But wait it gets better. Gabriel Byrne shows up to take out Fishburne before he can rat him and other dirty cops out. (although we never find out anything about their relationship or dealings). Interestingly the cops launching the assault on the precinct are in full SWAT gear with night vision goggles assault rifles the whole nine yards. Later on they even bring in a helicopter with MORE people in full gear. I'm not a cop but I'm pretty sure you can't just waltz out of the station with an entire swat platoon worth of equipment without someone asking what you are doing. And the police helicopter??? In the supposedly terrible winter storm??? Also no one near the precinct happens to hear or see this major siege going on with flash grenades and heavy rifle fire going off? I mean seriously come on. I know this is set in Detroit but even there it would raise suspicion on a supposedly top secret mission. I also love the fact that they find a Tommy Gun in the evidence room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and usable. I could live with some of these problems if there weren't other glaring issues also. For one the opening couple minutes of the movie are shot nicely in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and I thought was going to set the tone for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately I was wrong. The remainder of the film has no sense of pacing or tension or drama. The characters don't relate to each other in any way which is probably largely due to the fact that they aren't particularly interesting. There isn't enough interesting action to make this a good action movie and there isn't enough character development/storytelling to make this a passable thriller/drama. The relationship between Hawke/Fishburn is the only thing that the director even tries to make interesting or intense. Oh and by the way the final scene in the wilderness? Uh I thought this was in the middle of a run down industrial section of Detroit and suddenly we are in the woods?? The acting isn't terrible in this movie it is just that the directing and writing are atrocious. I really enjoy some of Hawkes Fishburne Byrne Dennehy's other movies but this one is terrible. ,neg
 One of the finest movies I have viewed...Good script original plot of a man who is haunted about JFK's assassination when he was assigned to protect him on that Cold November day in 1963. Thirty years later another anti-social lunatic wants to assassinate the current president. The secret service agent loses his partner along the way to the crazed gunmen who schemes lies and murders anybody in his path who'll stand in his way of his mission. The movie accompanies with a great memorable score and a restrained but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood....which displays how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. Malchovich is great sure many other candidates could have played the role that he played but how many could acted with such craftiness and intellect that he displayed in the movie? Needless to say I thought this was a great movie...everytime it's on television I have to watch it..and I own it on dvd! I'm a big Eastwood fan this only boosted his already fabulous career and Malchovich's best role to date! ,pos
 Too fractured to be enjoyable too loose to be interesting and too clumsily photographed to be tolerable MR LONELY is an interesting idea ruined by really bad film making. Like a Ken Russell film at its worst or DAY OF THE LOCUST remade by amateurs MR LONELY might have seemed like a good idea on a few scraps of paper (no script you see) and a free holiday to somewhere but in the end we have a widescreen film that seems as if it was made by film students whose parents told them that EVERYTHING they did was a brilliant creation. Or did I get the film maker right? MR LONELY is a waste of resources trying to be (gawd!) quirky and deliberately off kilter. It ends up being annoying and indulgent.. and pointless. What's the point of going to a commune in Scotland? What a stupid idea in this film about Hollywood delusion. Maybe Korine wanted to remake GODSPELL ... well the result is GOD-AWFUL. Oh and there is some subplot like leftover footage from FITZCARRALDO including Werner Herzog nuns and a plane. Add slo-mo drifting and violin music all wistful and melancholy add James Fox who seems to hope he might be seen as daring (like in PERFORMANCE) and the result is amphetamine fantasy alphabet soup in widescreen. It might have been fun to film but the result on the screen is a mess. Imagine American PIE BAND CAMP with food poisoning. ,neg
 This movie is based on the true story of Iowa housewife Lucille Fray who got breast cancer after the birth of her 10th child. Realizing that the state would take the children away from her ineffectual alcoholic husband she devoted the last year of her life traveling around the state to find new homes for each of the children. A terrific script - which still holds up 20 years after it was first made. The grown children many of whom had not seen each other since their mother died in the late 50's were reunited on That's Incredible prior to the film's airing in 1983. Barbara Stanwyck won the Emmy for best actress in a TV movie or mini-series but during her acceptance speech she went out of her way to single Ann-Margret out for her moving performance. ,pos
 A great movie about triumph over all the nay-sayers who try to kill your spirit achieving the impossible. I won't go on about it other than to say that I liked to reflect on the this film when I'm facing something particularly daunting and realize that if Lindberg could do what he did I can certainly face the task before me. Definitely a feel good movie. See it. You won't be disappointed. ,pos
 I'm working my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and THE MAD MONSTER is one of the movies in the set. I am sure that George Zucco was a good actor; but this was only the second film in which I saw him the first being DEAD MEN WALK in which he played two parts. However even good acting couldn't save THE MAD MONSTER. Zucco plays a mad scientist Dr. Cameron (who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhumane experiments). He believes that he can control evolution by bringing out the characteristics of one animal into another. In this case like so many others of its ilk it is a transfusion of (I assume) wolf's blood into humans. His goal is to create an invincible army which he can control through the antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hired hand a retarded gardener whose dialogue slows down this snail-paced classic to almost a full-stop. Beyond his experiments Dr. Cameron also plots revenge on those who discredited him using his transformed gardener. However he loses control of his subject who begins to transform without the transfusion -- yikes! The werewolf transformations are classic Hollywood stop-action / makeup effects. No doubt these were groundbreaking techniques of the time; but in today's digital age it's hard to imagine audiences being scared by this. ,neg
 This final installment of the Airport franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me awhile to realize it actually wasn't a slapstick comedy like Airplane . George Kennedy shooting a flare gun out an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles was comical. What would happen to your hand if you held it out a window at mach two speed? You'd lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm. The passengers were unintentionally hilarious as was the interior of the plane. The sophisticated French woman coming on to slobby George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy coming on to Ernest Borgnine. Ain't gonna happen. Susan Blakely a talented and unappreciated actress did not get any points on her resume for this one. Neither did Robert Wagner. This movie was so lousy it seemed surreal. ,neg
 I don't know if I should be amused or insulted by drivel like this put out by Lifetime: Television For Women Should be renamed Lifetime: Television For Shut In Drama Queens because I've yet to see a movie that wasn't a tear jerking pot boiler. This film was no exception. You know a film's going to be bad when the biggest headliner is Tori Spelling completely a creation of bad plastic surgery and spoiled privilege minus any real talent. Everyone else matched her in unbelievably bad acting and the storyline was beyond dumb as if anyone could believe any of it. If I hadn't have been helpless on the sofa pinned down watching with the same fascination you view a gory car wreck I would have changed the channel. ,neg
 If this movie is coming to a theater near you consider it a threat. I was unfortunate enough to see this movie here in Tokyo. Since I'm Dutch I was surprised to find a Dutch movie playing in a metropole like Tokyo is. I figured it had to be somekind of special if a Dutch movie makes it all the way to Japan. So I went there with some friends and we were happily telling the theater's staff that we were Dutch and that we were so curious about the movie. As it turned out this was one of the most infantile silly dumb worst acted with worst spoken English movie I've seen in maybe 10 years and I left the theater trying to avoid the staff because feeling almost responsible for this disaster movie. Sometimes you get the feeling you know what the director was aiming for: Lola Rennt Trainspotting kind of like movie. Instead it was more like MacGyver on drugs with outdated breakbeat music as a score. But if I wasn't feeling too annoyed the movie was unintentionally quite hilarious once in a while as it showed Holland at its smallest. ,neg
 The spoof genre which has lacked creativity and humor for some time already gets spat upon yet again by hacks with no talent. No point no fun no originality; just a few cheap bucks for the film makers. It takes more than just referencing some recent movies and giving characters double-meaning names to be satire; to make people laugh. Any clod can pick up a cam-corder and have some bad-acting buddies in cheap costumes imitate somebody. Since the genre being targeted this time is inspirational sports movies there are a few lame references thrown out to movies of that type: the jokes are so weak the characters actually have to emphasize the references in various ways to get you to laugh hysterically. It doesn't work. That's not comedy. However the same old worn out sophomoric jokes ripped off from a middle school washroom (done even more blandly than usual) are all here. If that's not enough there's a running gag of a bus running somebody over. So funny right? Also one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than Michael Bay; again with the same unfunny results. A musical bit flops miserably. Pity Carl Weathers once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series now stuck with roles in swill like this. Lousy beyond words. Watching a snail run the marathon would be less tedious than watching this film is. Probably a lot funnier too. ,neg
 The slasher sub-genre has been pretty much exhausted - in fact even by 1979 just one year after the supposed 'first slasher' Halloween (which was released seven years after Bay of Blood) was released; the sub-genre wasn't far from being exhausted; but Tourist Trap represents one of the more original outings. The film follows the same basic formula as most slashers - i.e. madman murders a load of kids but draws its originality from the fact that madman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an unseen assailant or a man in a mask) and we actually get some insight into his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities including being able to control the wax dummies that fill his house adds to the originality. We kick off with a great opening sequence which sees a young man fall foul of having a flat tire after finding himself in a gas station of terror. The scene is amazingly creepy as the wax dummies taunt him and things fly from the shelves - and it gives the audience a great insight into what is to come; namely a very creepy horror film! The acting credibility is as non-existent as you would expect from a seventies slasher but to be honest; it's not all that bad. The girls look hot the boys don't really matter; and Chuck Connors is more than adequately creepy in the role of the psycho. He's not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still good enough. It's not the acting that's the star of the show however and as you might expect - the creepy atmosphere takes that prize. Wax models as proved by the likes of House of Wax (Vincent Price version...) are very creepy; and the film makes best use of that fact. There are very few things in cinema that can be frightening by simply being there - but wax statues are definitely one of those things. The killer's special ability could easy have gotten in the way of the atmosphere but the film makes best use of this fact even by having various things fly off shelves and it goes well with the rest of the movie. On the whole this is a very good film. While Tourist Trap might not be absolutely essential viewing; it's well worth seeing and I can recommend it. ,pos
 The slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights. There was a certain deus ex machina flavour to the resolution of the cliffhanger but it was a good start for all that. As is now common with this Doctor the moral ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were centre stage. They were always there in the classic series but they were a side issue to be glossed over when the Doctor was in the heat of battle. This regeneration even says sorry to a cyberman during the battle! This episode finally shows Mickey embracing the heroic side that had been hinted at in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero is complete and it has been an utterly convincing one. With scares humour and scenes that brought a lump to your throat this episode had everything. After much consideration I can finally say that the new series betters the classic series in every single respect. Coming from a die hard Whovian you can get no better recommendation than that. ,pos
 Ron Howard and his editors only had one job to do... Follow the guidelines of the book which was rich mysterious moving and highly cinematic in its approach! What they did? They changed EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING! What is left is something that has no right being called Angels & Daemons ! I really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way! I wonder what was the opinion of Dan Brown himself for this film. I really have no patience to sit down and right the 1.000.000 changes they made it is pointless....... ,neg
 Sam Lion (Jean Paul Belmondo) discovers he needs to take some time off as everybody around him relies to much on him and stages his own death. When he discovers those he loved ans still loves are in need he gets Albert Duvivier (Richard Anconina) to help them. In search of his own past of his own desires this fabulous film by Claude Lelouch is a man's quest for himself at a ripe age. Built like all Lelouch films the film's beginning with constant flashbacks may be puzzling especially scenes where Paul Belmondo (who looks a huge lot like his father) is playing a young Sam Lion while Sam Lion stands in the same room - a flashback sequence which takes a second to grasp. One of Lelouch's most elaborate works L'itineraire d'un infant gate is a must-see tale of self fulfilment. ,pos
 Basically the first two Critters movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way. This movie is way more of a B-movie that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons. This is the first sequel that doesn't really follows the plot of the first two movies. Basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well as good as none since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late) and the budget for this one obviously went down again. To save even more costs the movie got shot back-to-back with part 4 which I imaging will be just as bad since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this one. It's just a typical B-genre movie that doesn't really have any originality in it or brings entertainment. It makes Critters 3 a real redundant sequel you can easily do without. Granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just ain't exactly a good one either. The movie just falls flat as a science-fiction/horror/comedy. Also kind of strange to notice how the Critters has suddenly changed in this one. They are about double their usual size this time without giving an explanation for that and they are even more Gremlins like in this movie than was the case in the previous one. The movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of Leonardo DiCaprio. He was about 17 in this movie and of course looking baby-faced like he still does now. I like watching this well known actors in their early roles. It's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course DiCaprio got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these days. Really a too silly and lame movie. 4/10 ,neg
 Alfred Hitchcock's Saboteur (1942) (not to be confused with another Hitchcock film Sabotage made in 1936 which has a completely different plot) is not the Master of Suspense greatest film. It dose not have the depth of Vertigo (1958) nor the brooding atmosphere of Rebbeca (1940) and it certainly dose not have the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in Notorious (1946) but what it dose have is thrills adventure and a nail biting climax. The two leads admittedly are quite weak. It is easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the Robert Cummings role and Barbara Stanwyck for the role that was taken by Priscilla Lane. Also the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (that were written by Dorothy Parker) have dated badly and the encounter with circus troupe is poorly done (the beard on the bearded lady is clearly false). However the last half hour is edge-of-your-seat viewing the climax atop the Stature of Liberty is very well done and the film is a clear predecessor of North By Northwest (1959). The two villains Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the beginning fire at the Aircraft Factory is a superb sequence. This not the best film Hitch made but it is surly one of his most entertaining. ,pos
 The movie is more of a mockumentary of corruption in the whole American system. The correlations of those who vote who do not matter is so proved in the machines that end of voting a comedian to the oval office. Politicians are such a joke that we almost need a comic to represent us as we have been laughed at for years around the world. Bushism's have become a way of life for Americans and will be the only thing left after he leaves office none to soon. Oddly the only person of honesty is someone not even elected to the position and tells the truth in the end. The story is very subtle and if you go to it for laughs it ain't happening. Leaves a lot for thought. Overall I enjoyed it. ,pos
 Ben (Rupert Grint) is a deeply unhappy adolescent the son of his unhappily married parents. His father (Nicholas Farrell) is a vicar and his mother (Laura Linney) is ... well let's just say she's a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus' army. It's only when he takes a summer job as an assistant to a foul-mouthed eccentric once-famous and now-forgotten actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters) that he finally finds himself in true 'Harold and Maude' fashion. Of course Evie is deeply unhappy herself and it's only when these two sad sacks find each other that they can put their mutual misery aside and hit the road to happiness. Of course it's corny and sentimental and very predictable but it has a hard side to it too and Walters who could sleep-walk her way through this sort of thing if she wanted is excellent. It's when she puts the craziness to one side and finds the pathos in the character (like hitting the bottle and throwing up in the sink) that she's at her best. The problem is she's the only interesting character in the film (and it's not because of the script which doesn't do anybody any favours). Grint on the other hand isn't just unhappy; he's a bit of a bore as well while Linney's starched bitch is completely one-dimensional. (Still she's got the English accent off pat). The best that can be said for it is that it's mildly enjoyable - with the emphasis on the mildly. ,neg
 It's too slow paced and complex for children and too lightweight and dull for adults. None of our family (6 weeks to 66 years) could be bothered watching it all the way through. Are there jokes in it? I couldn't really tell. There was certainly some unnecessarily adult innuendo. There was probably a bludgeoning message of sorts but I wasn't engaged enough to care. The live talent are just stumbling and mugging their way through it. I have to wonder if they were actually being paid or whether it was some form of community service or plea bargain. Please keep watching whines Daniel; honestly I wouldn't bother. ,neg
 I watched this episode a lot of times because I didn't get how Prue died. This is what happened. Prue Piper and Phoebe try and save their innocent A Doctor because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs to look in The Book Of Shadows while Prue and Piper are protecting their innocent. Shax appears while Phoebe is still upstairs so Shax throw an energy ball at the doctor but Prue pushes him out of the way and Prue get hit in the chest with it and smashes against the wall same with Piper. So Phoebe comes downstairs and says the spell since it was only Phoebe who said it and not the power of three Shax only got wounded. Phoebes calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. So Leo heals them. Phoebe went into the Underworld to find Cole meanwhile Prue and Piper are looking for Shax in the streets. Piper and Prue see Shax and Piper uses her Power to Blow up Shax meanwhile a New reporter got it all on tape. So its all over the new about the three powerful Halliwell sisters meanwhile Phoebe doesn't know anything because she is still in the Underworld. There's Repoters and people all over the Halliwell house. Then a maniac comes in the house and says Can I be Part Of Your Coven? and Prue says No this is our house get out of here! and Prue uses her powers to throw her out. As the maniac come out of the house crying saying There Mean Witches . The maniac gets so mad that she shoots Piper right through the stomach. Prue get in her car and trays to go to the hospital but people won't let her through so Prue uses her powers to move people out of the way making people wanna kill her more. They got to the hospital but Piper didn't make it. Meanwhile Phoebe is in the Underworld.Phoebe finds out that they have been exposed so Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can reverse time.The Source says he will only reverse time if Phoebe promises to stay here in The Underworld so Cole told Phoebe what the source told him. Phoebe says What would Make him think i would make a deal like that? and then Cole says So you can save one of your sisters lives. Leo goes to the hospital to find out the Piper really is dead so he tells Phoebe that its true. Then Phoebe agrees to stay only if Cole will go back to warn Piper and Prue about the exposer and death of Piper. Back at the hospital SWAT is about the shoot Prue but the second before they do time is rewound back when they were at the manor with the doctor but this time Phoebe wasn't there to call Leo to heal Prue and Piper so the doctor get throw in the wall too. The doctor died and so did Prue. But this is what I didn't get if Piper was throw against the wall too how come only Prue died? Why did they not show Leo come and heal Piper and Leo trying to heal Prue? If you know the answer please e-mail me at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss Prue but I like Paige too and i'm glad the show continued ,pos
 Just exactly HOW director John Madden come to settle with Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz playing the roles of an Italian Officer and a Greek Villager in an honourable story: Captain Correli´s Mandolin just escapes me! Witness: a wobbly inconsistent accent by Cage amid horrendous over-acting with Cruz -- more adequately cast as a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in Blow -- in basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse... ay it was painful. But there were saving graces. The story itself is thrilling-to-tragic and Cage does have some (-- redeeming this is !--) musical ability. Next a superb performance by John Hurt (Cruz´s father the village doctor) of Oscar Callibre as well as by Irene Papas each as village elders as well as by Christian Bale (Papas´ son) among the village freedom fighters go far towards counter-balancing awkward performances (especially at the beginning) by Cruz and Cage. Nicely the last two seem to grow into their respective roles as the film progresses but it´s teeth-gnashing early on. Finally the scenery itself and the photography could garner a technical award and such provides pleasant distractions when most needed. John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and this would be a third; I hope he gets it as his performance as the Doctor makes this film worth seeing. The true test of a supporting actor/actress is whether or not the film would be the same without the personage in question and in this case it would most certainly not be... not even close. Entertainment value but for the aformentioned plus factors which do help raise the bar. See it if you haven´t. Rating = 3.5 stars (of five). ,pos
 I watched the 1st scarecrow movie and didn't bag out that one though i knew it was b grade it actually had some decent gore and the guy playing the scarecrow was an awesome acrobat and had some good skills going. The effects were better and the costume looked heaps better then this movie. I borrowed this one with an open mind i am also a fan of ken shamrock (former ufc superfight champ) and was hoping it was a decent movie. Boy was i wrong the movie sucked the monster was pathetic in both appearance and in actually being scary the storyline was SO predictable it was like watching the movie in preview mode as i already would guess what will happen the music was so bad with a horrible lip sync song that made me wanna punch the screen. Overall avoid this crappy movie. Save some money. ,neg
 When I sat down in the cinema to see this I was expecting to see a sort of stylish tongue-in-cheek action film which had been implied by the trailers. However it very quickly became apparent that this film was trying to be more. Normally I don't approve of films that try to entertain in as many ways possible. For instance this film tries to mix action with comedy romance lightheartedness and gritty seriousness all at once. Most of the time this sort of approach doesn't work in films (just look at Batman Forever) but I was was pleasantly surprised to see that in this case they pulled it off. The end result is a highly entertaining film that should appeal to most mature cinemagoers. (However the weak of stomach should really be warned of one or two scenes.) Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller pull of a brilliant double act and Ken Stott does a excellent villain. This mixed in with superb costumes and a few decent action scenes makes for a very enjoyable watch. However the big let-down here for me is that in having 'The Gentleman Highwayman' there was a real opportunity for some good dialogue but the script was definitely lacking in punchiness and there were few belly laughs. Okay so the lines weren't terrible but to me it does highlight a problem with recent British films; ignoring a few notable exceptions the screenplays being written today are still relatively mediocre when compared to some of Hollywood's efforts. ,pos
 My friend took me to a screening of this movie in Hollywood and it was awesome! It's a film noir with amazing acting great script cool music the whole thing was very well done and entertaining. Don't know if it is getting a release in theaters but this would be a great date movie or a fun movie to rent if you see it at Blockbuster. This is the kind of movie I love low on budget but big on style and imagination. I hope Alexandra Holden gets more big parts like she has in this one she is fantastic. ,pos
 Three distinct and distant individuals' lives intersect with the brutal killing of one by another. The one-hour film only reveals the event that brings the three individuals together only after half the film is over. I have seen other segments of the Dekalog but this one struck me as the most sparse one in dialogue and yet most fascinating in structure. The film opens with a law student practicing a mock plea of defense for a man charged with murder. Obviously the same arguments must have been repeated by the man as a full-fledged lawyer but this is never shown on screen (at least in the short 1-hr version of Dekalog 5). We are made to imagine that this must have been the case. A cab driver who is a misanthrope has two facets to his character: the good side feeds a mangy dog cleans his cab meticulously picks up dirty rags thrown by people who lack civic sense and remembers his wife while dying; the bad side frightens small poodles refuses to give a ride to a drunk--probably worried that he will puke in the cab--and ogles at pretty girls. The repulsive protagonist who murders without mercy drops stones from bridges on fast moving traffic and pushes strangers into urinals without any provocation is also a person who can make innocent young girls laugh. Kieslowski's film and the script thus present the good and the bad side of two of the three main characters. Yet the film is not about capital punishment but more a treatise on killing. The Fifth Commandment Thou shalt not kill is explored theologically--( Even God spared Cain...') sociologically the tenderness of brutes to children and poor forlorn dogs and psychologically (after effects of drunken night with a male friend that led to the accidental death of his sister whose photograph he carries with him). What makes ordinary persons turn into killers--this is never fully explained but suggestions are legion. In Kieslowski's world there is a pattern where events and people are interlinked in a cosmic sense (note the resemblance of clown to the killer as it hangs from the mirror in the cab). Kieslowski and the young idealist lawyer seem to ask us to look at the Commandment literally and figuratively--why do we kill? Are the people legally killed truly bad? Is there a force beyond society (the drunken night that led to life of a girl) that makes us into abhorrent murderers? It would be missing the forest for the trees to discuss the two detailed killings in the film--both without mercy. The film invites the viewer to contemplate why we are asked by God not to kill. I understand a longer full-length version of the film was made by Kieslowski. But even this short 1-hr version is superb with its bleak and sparse script intelligent editing interesting cinematography and top-notch direction that provides much more than the sum of its parts. This segment anticipates the more wholesome Dekalogs 6 7 and 8. ,pos
 I have never read a Jacqueline Susann novel but I have also seen Valley of the Dolls based on another of her books. On both occasions I thought the movie is probably better than the book and will further improve with age (certainly contrary to the books). The reason being that a movie focuses more on a specific style in fashion design and behavior patterns. And in this aspect The Love Machine offers quite a lot. The set design fits the story perfectly. And all the characters fit in too. They're perfect in the way that they complete a well balanced general picture. They are superficial and do not develop it is true but in this movie I wouldn't want it any different. David Hemmings reprises the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than a rip-off. He's a fashion photographer looks visibly aged and seems to start going slightly to seed. Robert Ryan reprises the role he played in Max Ophül's Caught he is Smith Ohlrig all over again greedy bored and boring uninspired and uninspiring. It's possible Ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly on the other hand he might have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. Whatever happened it fits the picture. Dyan Cannon is great (fantastic wardrobe!) she dominates every scene she's in and is involved in the two highlights of the movie: the burning of a luxurious bed and the knocking down of the Hemmings character with a Academy Award statuette. The title The Love Machine is of course meant ironically. Robin Stone is a kind of a Barry Lyndon of the pop era (incidentally the movie IS slightly kubrickysh). That he chooses a TV station to work his way up to the top seems to be a mere coincidence. He sees love (meaning sexual favors) merely as a means for personal advancement. There are rather scary hints of a troubled sexuality which are not explored in the movie. Homosexuality is treated very casually probably not the standard for mayor movies of the period. The open cynicism of the TV executives need not fear comparison with other good movies about the subject like A Face in the Crowd or Network or Truman Show. They are producing crap they agree among themselves it's crap and they know they will make a lot of dough with it. I did not regret spending the odd 108 minutes with this movie and would not be surprised if it picked up a cult following provided it's given the chance (meaning a DVD release). ,pos
 I mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what I discuss although I don't really think I am giving away anything important. Any suprises are really unimportant to this film's success or a viewer's ability to enjoy it. While not without some very minor flaws this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship time uncertainty and the choices people make about their lives. Yet at the same time it is also a very humorous film with small mostly understated bits of comedy woven in throughout. For much of the film it progresses at a fairly leisurely pace but it does not seem slow at all since the film draws one into it and into the lives of the characters and at first it is mostly rather light-hearted. Some have commented that much of the film seems slow but it is such a wonderful portrayal of the lives of such sympathetic characters that one could watch it almost endlessly. As it progresses the film becomes more emotional and moving up to the very end and the progression is handled wonderfully. Eventually some of the characters decide to rob a bank and although it is perhaps somewhat hard to believe that is beside the point. It is a wonderful addition to emphasise the love that these friends have for each other while at the same time it accents the humour and adds a little more irony to the film. And although hardly original to have a bunch of old guys rob a bank the context and details are quite original and they do it wonderfully making it really quite funny as well such as when Ismet (if I remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to disguise the fact he's old. As I said most of the other comedy is rather low-key but still very humorous so I was constantly chuckling throughout. The actors are probably the real key to this film. They imbue the characters with deep personality and sympathy and portray them with great care and warmth. There are some small transformations or tiny details of the characters' personalities which are pulled off smoothly and beautifully. Of course the film is about the personalities of these very characters and how they care for and interact with one another. It succeeds so well because of them and if lesser actors had the roles the movie could well have failed. Gule Gule is not without sadness but that simply provides the full range of emotions and provides a more powerful experience. In fact the film is so moving and filled with so much love from such rich characters that it is in the end a very heart-warming satisfying and even happy film despite its sadness. I could watch it over and over. ,pos
 No gore no blood no gratifying death scenes...dumb dumb dumb dumb. Dear God sitting through this movie made me sick. Sick sick sick. Very boring...extremely boring... Theres not even a humorous aspect to this film! i cant find a good thing to say about it other than the lead guy had a nice body...I guess. Definitely not worth the fifty cents I paid to rent it. ,neg
 Personally the book was a very well written amazing thrilling piece that was not brought to justice to the movie. Watching the movie at 12.01 in the morning to see that major parts of the book were left out frustrated me seeing that it affected the different outcome of the movie. There was something to be desired out of this movie but all in all it lacked in plot. For someone who has NOT read the book I could see how this movie would be seen as inviting and entertaining with its controversy and suspense. However to a dedicated reader who has read it seven times I did not see the strong connection between the two: both the movie and the novel. With major characters missing (such as Maximilian Kohler) and the abrupt turn in plot with the survival of the last cardinal in the preferiti the plot of the movie was slightly strewn thus leading to a different take in the conclusion of the story. The Hassassin too was portrayed as a common white man compared to that of in the novel where he was portrayed as a Muslim; his motives in the book are predominately based his ties with the Illuminati however in the movie his motives are based on money and seemed more like work than some personal tie to the task at hand. ,neg
 since the plot like Vertigo or Brian DePalma's Obsession till to the score by Peter Chase that reminds the sounds of Bernard Herrmann this little pearl seems to be sight from fews. Remarkable playing by Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris portrayed from the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD are the french one and the English. Directed by a controversial artist as Gilles Mimouni it could be considered a little homage to the Cinema masterworks. It is a french movie and as all of them not for all we could say a d'essai cinema. Even if not so publicized it could be remembered for several reason. ,pos
 This comment discusses North and South Book I dealing with 1842-1861 period The 19th century history of the USA is mostly identified by people with the Civil War (1861-1865). This is a reasonable opinion because that was Civil War which put the Union under the severe test; that was the Civil War which made Americans realize how precious it is to live in peace; finally that was this period which at last brought the end to the shameful system of slavery. From the birth of motion pictures there were people who adapted that time onto screen. D.W. Griffith in the early 1900s made his unforgettable BIRTH OF A NATION. Yet the most famous film about the north-south clash is still I suppose GONE WITH THE WIND (1938). Unfortunately fewer people know the magnificent TV series based on John Jakes' novel North and South. It is the very best TV series ever made and the time spent on watching it is really precious. I taped it on my video from Polish TV many years ago and have come back to it with great pleasure many times since then. Why? Firstly the entire story is deeply rooted in historical reality. The two families the Maines from South Carolina and the Hazards from Pennsylvania represent two entirely different ways of life. In spite of that friendship unites them. Yet what they experience is the struggle all people do: friendship attacked by truth of political correctness love attacked by hatred of legal spouses gentleness by strength of social heroes . Orry Maine (Patrick Swayze) is my beloved character - someone who finds love and who is quickly deprived of her; someone who cares for friends but political fanatics step in the way and ruin much. Finally he is someone who can see the tragic future for his land but there is nothing he can do about the south's inescapable fate. His friend George Hazard is similar in most aspects but sometimes he appears to have a stronger character. It is him who shows Orry that although there are tragedies he must get up from despair and live since life is the most precious thing we have. Although they represent two different lifestyles their friendship occurs to be stronger than any prejudice politics or conflicts. Other characters are also particularly well developed. There are villains like Justin LaMotte or Salem Jones who are really wicked but most of the people are ambiguous as the nature of humanity has always been. Charles Maine is at first full of rebellion prone to fighting later however he learns to be a true southern gentleman for whom southern pride is not courageous words but foremost courageous deeds. Virgilia Hazard represents the most fanatical side of abolitionist movement striving to condemn slavery and punish the owners of black breeding farms. Her marriage with Grady appears to be a symbol of equality but also a symbol of saying NO to the politics of the south. Two interesting characters are Orry's sisters Brett and Ashton - sisters in whose veins runs entirely opposite blood. Brett in her gentleness but also naiveness believes in absolute fidelity. She marries Billy even though he is a northerner because she truly loves him. Brett is the representation of all that is precious in any young woman. Ashton however is a vamp a tigress a woman who does not hesitate to do the most wicked things. The clear picture of their world views clash is their chat about men and family...unforgettable moment and how universal! Most characters head for their values...yet war breaks out and they'll have to put aside a lot... Secondly the performances... someone said that not all people act naturally. I wouldn't say that. I'd rather say that all cast do very good jobs in their parts from the main characters who are portrayed by younger staff to the guests that consist of famous stars including Liz Taylor Robert Mitchum and others. Patrick Swayze as Orry does a great job. I consider this role one of his best ones. Lesley Anne Down as Madeleine is also very memorable. Her part perhaps entails too much suffering but she manages to express all sorts of feelings really well. Kirstie Alley is very appealing and truly memorable as the abolitionist Virgilia Hazard. Phillip Casnoff is worth consideration as horribly ambitious Elkanah Bent as well as David Carradine as a monster husband disgusting Justin LaMotte. And in contrast to him a mention must be made of Jean Simmons who is truly excellent as Orry's mother whose heart beats for the glory of family life and concord of union. Thirdly memorable moments of North and South leave an unfading trace in one's mind. Who can forget the first meeting of Orry and Madeleine - what charm what gentleness there is in this scene! Or is it possible to skip the moment when Madeleine's father dies? I found it really powerful there is a real drama in this moment a drama of a woman being left by someone who really loved her. I also liked Churubusco sequence and George Hazard so worried about the life of his dearest friend Orry. Then his meetings with Constance are terrific. Virgilia's speech in Philadelphia is a masterpiece of performance. And the final moment of the first part: although North and South may separate their friendship will never die. Orry and George symbolically join hands as the train moves on. Simply there are so many beautiful and powerful scenes that it's impossible to mention even half of them here. And these gorgeous tunes by Bill Conti and shot in brilliant landscapes. The music in North and South is very touching and memorable. What to say in the end? North and South is a real must have on DVD simply an amazing TV series about the victory of all that is precious in us: love friendship loyalty honor truthfulness absolute fidelity. 9/10 ,pos
 There's something intriguing about disaster movies. The simple primal premise can lead to several great stories. Granted most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but I can usually live with that. Unfortunately Flood probably marks the low point in the history of this sub-genre. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie even though screen time is split between different locations and characters. He gives a barely decent performance. As well Joanne Whalley is very uneven. Veteran actor Tom Courtenay (he played in Doctor Zhivago for heaven's sake) is particularly bad. I mean his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor. What an embarrassing performance for that man. The rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig whom I thought might be there as a plot device/eye candy gives by far the most convincing performance. Doesn't mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared. The script is really bad confusing and cliché. Some of the worse lines I have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the other.You've seen this story a thousand times. It employs every dramatic hook and tear-jerkers you've seen in Outbreak Armageddon the Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many others. The direction is awful. No sense of timing nothing inspired. The shots are bland dialog and action both fail to flow. Editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess? Without a doubt this movie tried to rely way too much on (rather poor) CGI. The human factor the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over. Scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done. The made-for-TV feel gives nausea. Some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter? No problem let's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cut/editing job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground in the most obvious way possible. The movie score is rather poor. All over the place no timing. The ending is probably the worse I have seen in quite some time. Very much like they ran out of ideas. Scrap that you can't run out of something if you never had it in the first place. Must have ran out of budget. This is a really amateur job. I give it a 2 for using London as a location which is a nice change for Gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few CGI shots that were decent (those of the water closing in on London and the gates). Do yourself a favor and check out Day After Tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one. This includes older classics like The Towering Inferno. ,neg
 This film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making. The lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all. We have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face. The jokes are all lame I never laughed once it was Saturday night there were 5 of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room. The film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways ruined the night ! OK so pros and cons. Pros beautiful setting in Hawaii looks good on bluray. Cons worst acting ever; you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday. Predictable poor plot. Zero character development. Forced jokes which fall flat. Many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma. May all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap. ,neg
 Whoever likened this one to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK certainly knew whereof he spoke. He might as well have likened it to some of the adventures of the pulp heroes that followed. Kay Hoog reminds one more than a little of both Lamont Cranston (The Shadow) and Clark Savage (Doc Savage). (The Shadow quintessential man of mystery- and the very first Dark Knight - was also thought to be one Kent Allard. If one were to take Savage's first name first and add to it the Kent you end up with- voila- Clark Kent. Funny innit?) Like Indiana Jones Hoog isn't above pilfering the artifacts of an ancient civilization (though his thefts are often more blatant and less charmingly roguish than Jones's). Unfortunately this two-parter is a far cry from subsequent serials (from any era) in terms of overall quality. One of the first indications that something is amiss vis a vis the cinematic storytelling is a scene where desperados on horseback quite literally breathing down his neck simply watch as Hoog escapes their clutches in a hot air balloon. Why they don't bother to shoot down the balloon is just one of the many movie-making mysteries that plague these two films. The second half of this two-parter is even worse than the first. Granted this was one of the first ever serials and as such should be cut a bit of slack- but there are limits even to tolerance. (At one point the capture of the hero is effected not on screen but in the narration itself! Talk about cutting corners...) Fritz Lang happens to be one of the greatest filmmakers to ever make films; unfortunately for those of us who admire most of what he did THE SPIDERS is a bitter pill indeed to swallow... ,neg
 An unjustly neglected classic Intruder in the Dust is one of the great films of the 1940's which has unfortunately slipped into obscurity. Based on a story by William Faulker and shot in his hometown of Oxford Mississippi Intruder tells the story of Lucas Beauchamp (played with great dignity by Juano Hernandez) a black man unjustly accused of the murder of a local white man and a white boy (Claude Jarman Jr.) who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to Beauchamp. Terrific acting especially by two great character actors Porter Hall (as the dead man's father) and Elizabeth Patterson (best known as Mrs. Trumbull on I Love Lucy ) as an old woman willing to stand against the townspeople to see that right is done. This straightforward tense and sincere study of racial bigotry deserves to be seen more. ,pos
 Usually when BBC releases a TV series one is used to a certain satisfaction guarantee. Usually the TV series is splendid even if the story is boring you can trust the acting will make the it worth while. When I came across Persuasion here at the local library I was looking forward to an enjoyable evening cause I read the story. I'm glad I read the story first otherwise I would not think highly of it. Further was I relieved to learn that the production date of this TV series was from 1971 since I thought until that moment that BBC had lost it. It is really bad and should be used in acting schools as a horror movie. The only positive thought I have about this series that the people in this film are not likely to appear or be involved in any BBC or other product this century other than the young Musgroves sisters who apparently were taking their fist steps in acting and doing remarkably well under the direction otherwise given. ,neg
 I didn't really HATE Mirrormask. I just really wanted more from a movie than pretty visuals. The movie begins with a young girl named Helana who works in a circus. But while other children (supposedly) want to run away to the circus she only wants to run away FROM the circus. During a heated argument with her mother Helana wishes she would drop dead. Bad move. The mother gets ill with...something (presumably cancer) and needs surgery. On the night before surgery she dreams she travels to a wonderful world composed of her her dreams and nightmares where she finds herself . Personally the movie got crap for me as soon as she started dreaming. The early scenes show the weird and wonderful world of the circus and then contrast it with the bleakness of the hospital and the filth of an apartment block. But a soon as she dreams the whole films shifts to CGI land where nearly everything is a computer image. The problem is that this dream world has none of the mystery and wonder it should have. while films like the Wizard of Oz seemed enticing to explore Mirrormask shoves images in our faces and then snatches them away to give us another image. There's little rhyme or reason to the design in this film and even though some things are very pretty (the librarian is a masterpiece) they just disappear so quickly that they're soon forgotten. Helana and her sidekick Valentine are annoying at best and unbearable at worst. Overall Mirrormask is like a pretty stake that you bite and find out is actually ash. Stick to the real world kids. ,neg
 There was a time when the Alien series was a success with even the third installment Alien 3 showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young David Fincher. The first Predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story in peak star Arnold Schwarzenegger and director John McTiernan (Die Hard). The films Alien Aliens Alien 3 and Predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike. Arguably Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two. Step in Paul W.S Anderson Alien Vs Predator and now the Brothers Strauss (visual effects graduates not even directors or writers). The problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the Sci-Fi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial newbie's has led to nothing more than profanity epitomised by incompetence. Upon witnessing Alien Vs Predator Requiem (AVPR) die-hard fans will feel sick to their stomachs that this series could have got any worse. One example of the cinematic deterioration of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause nausea among fans. The film begins with an Alien making its way onto the Predator ship spurting from the predators chest growing in to a full grown Predalien and bringing down the Predator craft (which now seems to have far less Predators on it than it did at the end of Alien Vs Predator) and all this occurs with the ship still in Earths atmosphere. Once the ship has crashed AVPR quickly resorts to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions it makes no venture at utilizing any of the twists or subversions served up in the two original films. The wearisome plot progresses with tedious pace punctuated only by the near rousing conflicts of Alien and Predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an alluring blonde in a bikini or rapid gunfire. AVPR is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative elucidation i.e. members of the public outwitting an elite military unit or the Predator not adhering to laws established in previous editions. This is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature. Independently the film has no heart no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity. This is exemplified by the over arching narrative of the film as it undermines the basic premise of the first Alien. Because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first Alien film would have been more proficient and not so ill prepared when encountering them. On a cinematic note the film is close to being dire I felt urged at some points to shine a torch at the screen the lighting was so bad. Through utilizing such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action  which is ironically its purpose and also indicates the films lack of budget. As with all science fiction one scene normally surfaces as being the most memorable in this instance it is probably the hospital impregnation scene as it ever so tenuously draws on the themes of the original Alien by literalizing it. The directing is poor performances weak and the script rotten. AVPR is the product of a conveyor belt system of film-making in which ideas and techniques are assembled by ineffective people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas. This is personified by the absence of gory death scenes and drawn out blood battles because the certification will not allow it  a lower certification achieving a larger target audience. AVPR was purely a business venture and nothing more. ,neg
 Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! Wooden acting coupled with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times. Everyone in this movie should attend Overactors Anonymous. You would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young men at a prep school are tying to come to grips with the Pearl Harbor bombing. It does raise interesting questions but the manner in which they are conveyed make it more of a joke. The typical characters were present including the zealous jock and nerd (glasses included). I could not have been more uninterested in the wooden dialog and cliché characters. Upon the completion of the movie I had to throw the DVD in the trash. Stay far away from this dud! You won't get the 90 minutes of your life back! ,neg
 One night on an independent channel famous for showing off-the-wall films was aired this monstrosity. Though tempted to turn it off we watched it to the bitter end hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value. Alas there was none. Absolutely nothing. The film quality was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the editing was ridiculous. Then again there was precious little to salvage. After a few minutes of Cameron Mitchell's doctor character narrating about some patient of his the viewer is tortured by no plot pathetic writing abysmally terrible acting and an utter lack of cohesion and continuity. The rotting cherry on top of this fetid mess was the most horrendous special effects and makeup to ever disgrace the screen even for television. The main character stumbles through his role in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of dishwashing gloves which appear to have been dipped in glue and rolled in beads. Perhaps the poor lighting and gag-worthy film quality were attempting to cover up how bad-to-the-tenth-power the makeup was. One can only hope that at least one deliberate decision was made in the course of this hopelessly amateurish video. Seriously a handful of three-year-old kids could've produced a better project. At the end poor Mr. Mitchell returns (how desperate he must've been for money!) and drones out some nonsense that's supposed to connect this pile of crap with the AIDS epidemic. Please spare you and your loved ones the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this. It was so bad even Mystery Science Theater 3000 couldn't have salvaged it. ,neg
 Apparently the writer and director of this direct-to-DVD slasher movie is a fan of Friday 13th and other summer camp slashers. This movie has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend the weekend with fun alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called Camp Blood the old man who warns them not to go there; and of course the crazy killer with the machete who keeps on slashing and hacking at the teenagers without any reason at all... The whole thing could have worked if it had been shot on 35 mm film with acceptable Special Effects. But instead the Special Effects are poorly done. The killer walks around as if he's out on a Sunday afternoon stroll and the only good things about this movie are the acting of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning. Other than that - dull and forgettable. Jasper P. Morgan ,neg
 Despite the fact that the plot follows the well-known recipe of who did it which has characterised all the Perry Mason movies so far the characters of the present film are not so well-developed and the selected cast fails to give them flesh and blood. Of course in general the Perry Mason movies are not significant but even for their low standards this one is weak. ,neg
 I saw the movie in Izmir as the closing film of Izmir film festival. I didn't know anything about it but right now I'm glad I didn't refuse the chance to see Ding-a-ling-less! It IS one of the funniest movies I've ever watched and believe me I've seen zillions of movies!! (I'm a film critic!) Clever script and dialogs... Smart details... What else can I say? AN indie masterpiece with a totally unique style of humor... One can't stop by wonder what he's capable of right now. Ding-a-ling less was shot five years ago and i'm sure the director Onur Tukel is more mature now. I heard that his next feature will be a political satire and I really can't wait to see that too among with his previous works like House of Pancakes ... ,pos
 I wish Hollywood would make more movies like The China Syndrome. Because this one scores on every level. It has an intelligent believable script. It shows you that it's not only nuclear power itself but the money involved in it that causes danger. And the movie also gives you a great behind-the-scenes look of how television is made. It scores as a thriller: the first time I saw it it kept me right on the edge of my seat. And it scores as a character-movie: I really cared for the main characters. Jane Fonda Michael Douglas Wilford Brimley and most of all Jack Lemmon are great. ,pos
 Comic secret agents have made a comeback in recent years with Mike Myers' 'Austin Powers' and Rowan Atkinson's 'Johnny English' and more recently Steve Carell in the big-screen version of the hit '60's show 'Get Smart!'. Back in 1974 it was David Jason who was wearing a shoulder holster and carrying an attaché case full of documents marked 'Classified'. 'The Top Secret Life Of Edgar Briggs' was his first starring role in a sitcom after years of being a supporting actor in such shows as 'Six Dates With Barker' the 'Doctor' series and 'Hark At Barker'. Humphrey Barclay had found him working in a pier theatre in Bournemouth and was sufficiently impressed to include him alongside Michael Palin Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the children's comedy show 'Do Not Adjust Your Set!'. 'T.T.S.L.O.E.B' cast Jason as 'Edgar Briggs' a well-meaning but incompetent agent for the Secret Intelligence Service. Whereas John Steed wore a bowler hat Briggs had a trilby. Whereas Napoleon Solo carried a radio pen Briggs owned a pipe. Objects fell to bits in his hands. He read Confidential documents in bed while his wife ( Barbara Angell ) perused Woman's Own ( on one occasion it would be the other way round ). When he tracked a pair of Russian agents to a heliport he accidentally switched on the airport's Tannoy system and broadcast his plans to capture them! When he hid on a train so as to photograph a meeting between an S.I.S. man and his enemy-contact it moved off with him aboard and took him straight to Brighton! When he tried to organise the defection of a female Russian scientist he took a 'short cut' to elude his pursuers only to wind up hopelessly lost in a car park. Yet like 'Inspector Clouseau' he always seemed to come out on top at the end much to the dismay of his colleagues. As previously mentioned he was married. His wife Jennifer was understanding about the sort of work he did. Though they had a row once which resulted in her yelling at him from the window of their high-rise flat: Secret Service this Secret Service that! You never stop thinking about the Secret Service! . He shouted back: Think of the neighbours! They're not supposed to know I'm in the Secret Service! . Briggs was part of a team of agents whose number included 'Coronation Street' villain Mark Eden ( he was the psychotic Alan Bradley ) as 'Spencer' Michael Stainton as 'Buxton' and 'Doctor At Sea''s Elisabeth Counsell as the lovely 'Cathy Strong'. They answered to 'The Commander' played by the late Noel Coleman. The Commander was kidnapped in one episode leaving Briggs temporarily in charge of the S.I.S. - which naturally horrified everyone. This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna who had written for the 'Doctor' series. Rather than spoof Bond it was more of a send-up of the serious spy shows such as 'Callan' ( though it had a Bond-style theme tune ). Furtive meetings in underground car parks code-breaking stolen missile plans that kind of thing. Jason brought a lot of energy to the role doing a lot of his own stunts such as Briggs falling off a ladder whilst decorating his flat and tumbling down a hill in a wastepaper bin and were reminiscent of those to be found in the 'Pink Panther' films. 'Briggs' had all the ingredients to be a smash-hit. Unfortunately it was not networked. In the London area it was put out on Sundays at 7.25 P.M. where it was trounced in the ratings by the B.B.C.'s soapy drama 'The Brothers'. It was then moved to Fridays at 7 P.M. because I.T.V. wanted to showcase its latest American import - the T.V. version of 'Planet Of The Apes'. Briggs never found an audience. A similar fate befell Jason's next major show: 1976's 'Lucky Feller'. It was not until 1977 and 'A Sharp Intake Of Breath' that he found his first successful solo vehicle. You can see the title sequence ( along with two brief excerpts in German! ) for this series on YouTube. Unfortunately that is all you can see. Jason will not permit his early starring shows either to be repeated or released on D.V.D. A great shame. For the moment however Edgar Briggs' life will have to remain top secret. CODA: I have seen a number of episodes recently and I'm pleased to say it stands up incredibly well. ,pos
 I think the best way for me to review this title is to split it into its pros and cons. PROS: ~ they turn into wolves rather than plastic/cartoony monsters. ~ the chase of the wolves through the forest ~ Cash Machine by Hard-Fi being played CONS: ~ some parts of the script makes you cringe (for example the terrible part where the woman escapes the 'games' of the Fortunate Five boys and there's about half an hour of Dear cousin and a round robin of Yes see we know Gabriel's law ) ~ the diving transformation is ridiculous ~ the obvious and ridiculous ending ~ Aiden being told thousands of times to leave and then goes if you cared about me you would have left me ~ the obvious characters ~ the unnecessary parcour ~ the completely unnecessary slashing of the arm by Aiden ~ cringey speeches by Gabriel You see what I mean. I adore werewolf films and I tried watching this a few times to see if I'd like it better but it just made it worse. I think I'll just read the book and see how I get on. Don't bother with this unless you have a 12 year old brother or sister into spooky things. Anyone over that age may suffer and want their hour and a half back. ,neg
 My wife and I never got into the movie.We thought it was way to sloooowwww and to many subtitles.I understood they needed them for Vietnam but took to long to get out of Asia.She wanted it off I said it's going to get better.It never did yes they had a tough time trying to get to America but I wanted to see him looking and finding his dad.Not at the end but forming a relationship.Did I mention it was slllloooowwwwww.I love to watch a movie to feel good not sad at the end.I know they don't make many good movies now days.I think action movies are the only ones to watch.I have been renting a lot from netflix and now blockbuster maybe 20% are worth seeing.I don't kneed realism or facts just a movie thats fun and makes you feel good.Gary ,neg
 Where to begin where to begin . . ?(Savannah in the episode Gimme Shelter ) To disabuse: Fox/Viacom does not at this point in time have any intention of releasing THE show on DVD. But be not downhearted! That you are reading this reveals that the magic lingers fifteen years on . . . And small wonder. This was post-modern television a valiant attempt to visualize magical realism. 'neath the blue patina charm and brio were scripts bursting with symbolism and metaphor music that actually interacted with scenes! And ultimately an attempt however doomed to recapture one's belief in innocence to reclaim Eden as it were . . . It's potency is perhaps best attested to by the fact that even as we umm type a book is being written about the show wherein will be found the thoughts fancies and reminiscences of many of the show's actors writers directors and producers.

 The basic story idea of ENCHANTED APRIL is excellent--two very unhappy wives meet and decide to pool their funds to rent an Italian villa for a month. To further defray costs they get two other strangers to come along. What makes it interesting are the relationships both before and during this vacation--in particular showing how this beautiful setting actually changes their outlooks on life. Unfortunately this good idea is totally spoiled by two key performances in the ensemble cast that are so bad that they ruin the film. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a manner that makes her seem ridiculous. Her doe-eyed expression and vacant stares really make you wonder if this isn't a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot! And to make it worse Reginald Owen plays a character so obnoxious and bombastic that I was very close to turning off the film--he was that awful and unbelievable. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this movie a 10--which is very very difficult to understand. Sure the film has great ambiance and a good plot but these two glaringly silly performances cannot be overlooked as they undermine the rest of the picture. Sorry but this film was aching for a re-make! ,neg

 The Student Nurses is an excellent film that deals with four women bonded by friendship and career. For the first time one is able to see a realistic portrayal of relationships inside the work place outside the work place the risks of those relationships and the consequences. This film also offers a rare chance to see veteran stage and television actress Katherine Scottie MacGregor as the nurses' instructor Miss Boswell. Ms. MacGregor is best known for her performance as Mrs. Oleson on the television series Little House on the Prairie. The direction music and print color are very good as well as the opening theme song performed by Clancy B. Grass III. This film offers a rare opportunity for those who enjoy themes centered around the late 1960s and early 1970s which offers a softer side to life while appreciating the beauty of the female sex. ,pos
 Good footage of World War I-era ships and planes supplement this excellent war drama set in the Adriatic. Walter Huston is excellent as the commanding officer who knows his place and his place has no room for personal feelings. The safety of the ship and the mission must always come first. Robert Montgomery is the Lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role that a leader must play in combat. He makes bad decisions endangering the submarine and its crew but finally becomes a real man after he is court martialed and dismissed from the Navy. Robert Young plays a lieutenant junior grade and Jimmy Durante as a cook. Paralleling the war drama is an equally important wartime love triangle between Montgomery and Madge Evans who plays Huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically injured aviator. Recommended. ,pos
 You have to acknowledge Cimino's contribution to cinema. He gave us both the most over-rated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst film in history (Heaven's Gate). And before you start with the 'It's bad but not the worst ever' let me explain. For 20+ years I listened to the critics and avoided Heaven's Gate -actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film. Then a few days after seeing the 'Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate' documentary I stumbled on a used $9.99 DVD of the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection) and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear son's movie. Then you will have an idea of just how big a mess Cimino made. While pretty much everything is wrong with this film what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameless distortion of history. Although the cattlemen's association did send a group of regulators/gunmen to Johnson County and did have a list of targeted names the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9 1892 Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas hired guns who had come to Johnson County to clean out rustlers. The citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally were arrested (or rescued) by the Army. Women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from Ray and Champion there were minimal casualties. After all these were sieges not assaults-and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulations (early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the Indians). And weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial including Jim Averell the keeper of a modest road ranch and his wife Ella Watson (who Cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows Averell living to a ripe old age). There is no movie-making sin greater than fictionalizing history if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened. Fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it is harsh to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. He could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense-the film provides plenty of support. If Cimino was insane during the production of Heaven's Gate it would explain a lot of things. But my vote goes to 'lack of directing talent' instead of insanity. There are some good things about Heaven's Gate. You can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artful dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters). The dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary. But don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant-like explosions of communal action. This implies that there was a method to Cimino madness. 'Experiments' is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence Cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. What it looks like is that he just turned his DP loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots-1.5 million feet of loosely staged scenes. Then he tried (without success) to pare this down and fit everything together in post-production. The final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen (perhaps borrowed from a 'Fiddler On The Roof' touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. Unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly. After you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of 'The Grapes of Wrath') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing that review. So believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980. It is a sloppy disconnected poorly paced and historically distorted mess. Of value only as a 'how not to make a film' example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the American west. ,neg
 (This review contains a huge spoiler but I don't know how to explain how cool it is without giving it away) I saw pinoccio's Revenge a while ago. Now you might think it's just a rip-off of Child's play. Indeed there are similarities. However Chucky was a possessed doll who works independently of the kid. It is POSSIBLE that Pinoccio is possessed with a demon or cursed or something. however the puppet itself is actually completely inanimate. The KID is insane and THE KID is the one killing people! Everyone including the audience the survivors and the Kid herself thinks it's the doll. But it's the KID. The nudity is almost a pity because otherwise I could tell everyone to see it because it really is an interesting horror movie. ,pos
 Acting 10 Script 1. Hurlyburly is from that unfortunate postmodern school of theatre that has declared anything resembling a story or plot is forbidden. While people may get away with this on stage on film it becomes deadly -- or at least deadly dull. We're left with a bunch of great actors spouting dialogue that while brilliantly written adds up to nothing. Even worse every character speaks with the same voice despite their backgrounds. The only attempt to differentiate is to have teen-waif Anna Paquin use the word ain't. Never mind that the characters are unsympathetic losers to the extreme the camera work is plain sloppy and (for LA residents) the attention to geography is laughable. (Hint: the view out Sean Penn's front window is about eight miles away from the view out his back window and you can't drive south through Hollywood and wind up in Glendale pretending to be Burbank.) Okay suspension of disbelief and all that -- and normally I wouldn't pay attention to little things like that because they are just vagaries of production. But the fact that they did stick out so much despite the thespian pyrotechnics on screen says a lot about the weakest element of this enterprise -- the script. In short skip this one even on video. Rabe picked the wrong quote from the Scottish Play for his title; Hurlyburly would have been better named A tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing. A bit long for the marquee perhaps -- but at least it would be honest advertising. ,neg
 OK..you people need to settle down! This movie is not that bad. I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it! I do have to admit that I have never been a fan of LeeLee Sobieski but she grew on me in this movie. I do think Josh Hartnett is good looking but c'mon..Chris Klein is the most gorgeous man I think I have ever seen!!! He made that movie better for me. C'mon girls..when he has no shirt on and goes to get water I know your mouth dropped. Yes I know in the beginning he is a jerk but in the end he realizes how he acted and learns to be a great guy. If he wouldn't have come at the end..then I would have been mad. I do think a couple of lines did not need to be said but all in all it was a great movie! I definitely recommend it! ,pos
 I cannot believe I actually set up a 'season pass' on my TiVo for this apparently they had a good preview or something .. I can't imagine it though. After seeing about 5 minutes I thought to myself.. why am I watching this.. It is definitely not reality and some of the worst acting I have ever seen on television.. I am a total addict of reality TV and there is nothing real about this. THE ACTING.. (if you can call it that) is awful.. The only ones that are almost 5% decent are the girls that are meant to draw viewers to the show.. although they would need to be a lot prettier to save this train wreck.. if they would have more lines they would probably change my mind as they probably have no talent either. This is obviously a very low budget production with 'actors' who are apparently very cheap. There is no way they could get a job in anything else. Someone needs to direct these people to a job in food service.. Maybe they could do that. Oh and by the way Parco P.I. no longer occupies any space on my TiVo or TiVo's season pass list. Definitely the worst show I've ever seen. ,neg
 This picture's following will only grow as time goes by. Better than any of the best picture nominees in 97 and it rewards repeated viewings. I've seen it three times now so I know. Anderson was compared to some of the great American directors (Altman Scorcese Tarantino) and he may have those influences but chances are after a few more films he'll be considered part of that short list himself. One last note: Julianne Moore's Amber Waves will resonate in the memory long after other 90's movie characters have faded. THE best performance of the year -in any of the four categories. ,pos
 If this film won the Lumiere Award for Best French-Language Film then what kind of garbage is coming out of France these days?? The subject matter is an important one -- how the African economies are kept as economic hostages by the international organizations that are supposed to be helping them namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. About 40% of the governmental budgets of several African nations go to payment of Western debt while their people suffer from disease dehydration and illiteracy. ... but the subject matter was treated in the most dry manner that could be conceived by man -- dryer than the Sahara that surrounds the country of Mali in which this film takes place. More monotone and action-lacking than any documentary I've ever seen (and I'm a fan of the genre) one witness after another comes forward in this trial that is captured on film that condemns the World Bank & IMF. Some critics may site the colorful visual asides within the film but they were out of place and had no complementary soundtrack when they were on the screen. They belonged better in a coffee table book than in this film. Even the characters in the film say something like This trial is boring and When will it be over? Everyone in the theater laughed. Were those people on the screen reading our minds?? Danny Glover had a brief appearance in this film. It is a televised movie within Bamako and it was set within Morocco or Mali. It was also more ridiculous than any spaghetti-Western I've ever tried to avoid. The only redeeming part of these five wasted minutes was where a Caucasian bad guy accidentally shoots an African woman carrying a baby and shows no remorse whatsoever. Perhaps it was to symbolize the insensitivity of the World Bank and how it is unintentionally killing Africans. And one last technical parting shot the subtitles were difficult to read with so much light colors on the screen and not enough black outline to the subtitles themselves. I've already summarized the movie for you. Don't be fooled by the hype. No need to see this film. You'll never get these two hours back in your life. ,neg
 When this series aired I watched most of it. I think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of The Fugitive and The Incredible Hulk where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems. In this case the hero's problem is his progressive aging in reverse. I liked what I saw of these shows. The acting was good especially the sorrowful relationship between the lead character and his wife. Problem is: They cancelled it before it had a chance to end. (either that or I missed the last episodes). They never got a chance to wrap up the story either knowing it had been cancelled. Poof it was just gone. However like I said before I might have missed the last episodes. But my proof to the contrary is this: I rented the tape. Where I left off in the series. The lead character's wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving King's famous organization the Shop. While getting away hero is kidnapped. It ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the Shop. The end. Last episode. On the video: His wife does not die but escapes the fire with him. Right when he should get nabbed by the Shop he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence. Abrupt silly and cheap to the extreme. They just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was. They might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb detonations. Almost Pythonesque. The show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the David Bowie song of the same name ,neg
 The film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity. Has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked? It looks like the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include some (if not a lot) of nudity of the local stars together with slang which otherwise in the nowadays Portuguese society is repulsed with horror. If you watch advertising for Portuguese films at Portuguese TVs they all have included a hot scene from the movie. I'm not saying by any means that Portuguese society is alienated; just that the movie industry does not seem capable of finding others ways of success. Going back to the movie... There is nothing left from the spirit of the book which is a masterpiece. The film could have been a good one had there been emphasized the real idea of the book (of actuality at any time) and not the strictly erotic part. It had almost all the ingredients... but the chef was awful... ,neg
 I first seen this movie like a year and a half ago and I loved it I decided to get the DVD last year for my birthday.. It has the right amount of suspense action and drama.. This movie is about prep school called The Regis School and its packed with rebellious kids in which one kid William Tepper (Sean Astin) has a hard time adjusting due to prior rejections from other schools cause they couldn't control his rebellious act and now at The Regis School committing more acts of a rebellion there school gets taken over by terrorists on a random day and which the real reason is because the leader Luis Cali's (Andrew Divoff) father has been sent to prison and the leader will do anything including killing the students setting bombs and so forth in order to get his father back. Along side William Tepper is his rebellious friends at the Regis School one in particular is Joey Trotta (Wil Wheaton) in which this guy holds a troubled past of living in a Mafia family and being sent to The Regis School because of hating his father for who he is and which now he must deal with these terrorists taking over the school so William Joey and there friends must band together to stop these terrorists from violent acts and hazardous tactics. This movie was really awesome and I believe people should notice it more because when people think of a good hostage movie they would say Die Hard and even though I would have to agree with them they need to recognize that Toy Soldiers was a good thriller it sure had my heart beating because the students are my age and I would be scared to confront terrorists like these if they took over our school ... But overall this movie is really worth a good 112 minutes of your time and If I had a decision to rent or buy it... I WOULD BUY IT! I recommend it with a lot of hype! 8/10 ,pos
 This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called Leatherbridge which seems to be the dullest place in the country. It features a bar with no visible staff or customers a university with no students a police station with no criminals and a doctors' surgery with more doctors than patients. The story lines are dire - every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of brummie extras who can never actually act and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem. Pretty entertaining for its pure comedy value but I cannot believe that this thing actually masquerades as a serious drama. Bonkers. ,neg
 35 years after this was made Castro still reigns. Unfortunately we're left scratching our heads wondering how the dim-witted maniac played by scenery-chewing Jack Palance made it as far as 1960. I stumbled back across this recently and was amused at noticing the incomparable Sid Haig and B movie favorite Paul (Untouchables) Picerni among the rebels. Fleischer was obviously well past his prime when he directed this foolishness. Some of the lines are classic in a Did he really say that kind of way?' The other thing I just noticed is that the score and the sound (NOT the dialog) are actually excellent -- the only first-rate elements of the entire production. So don't watch this to learn anything about history or acting but if you feel like watching this as a goof bring the beers and have some fun. ,neg
 Wonderful family film that should be a staple at Christmas time. It's a mystery to me why it isn't. A true lost film that I first encountered flickering away on my old 19 black and white RCA when the Million Dollar Movie was still in vogue on Channel 9 in New York City. This Rudolph Mate directed fantasy should be nestled under everyone's Christmas tree. But it has never been released on home video. Too bad. I believe I saw part of it on AMC a few years ago before they cut many of their older films from the rotation. TCM should take up the slack and play it at Easter or on Christmas Eve. Any movie with Santa Aunt Bee the Hostess Cupcake Lady and an actor with the first name King can't be bad. Ann Blyth as Sally is a bundle of energy. During her school years she rushes over to the chapel to pray for St. Ann to help and give guidance to her mixed-up and financially strapped family. It works. So after she graduates she places a statue of St. Ann in her own bedroom. At one point the entire O'Moyne residence is moved to another address. I think this was done to put an end to a neighbor dispute between the O'Moynes and the dastardly fellow next door. Blyth is cute as a button. Edmund Gwen can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep. All-in-all this is a satisfying movie experience. ,pos
 Have to agree that this movie and it's talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. Here's hoping that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. The actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent. Perhaps overall the movie is a little long but May Miles Thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary. Good for the actors I am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot. May Miles Thomas deserves more recognition from the Film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors  ,pos
 As John Grierson pointed out: The documentary genre can be defined like this: the creative interpretation of reality This fabulous 180-minute documentary marks the first time a computer-generated project about dinosaurs respects the intelligence of the viewer. When I saw Jurassic Park which I was expecting with great excitement I was left extremely disappointed. Of course the dinosaurs were great but the story-telling was unnecessary. I thought: What if they made a documentary on dinosaurs with no crying children or bad puns just dinosaurs made as realistic as possible to let us marvel at what was once reality. My dream came true. The BBC has produced an exhilarating documentary exploring the different eras of the dinosaurs. This part is to all the people that seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess at many points concerning the behavior skin patterns etc: Of course they have to. Nobody was there. I think it is fantastic that they could present something as realistic as that. The guessings are all based on the knowings of many paleontologists and it allows the viewer to have a pretty good idea of what it was like. If you wanna stick to what we know for sure then just go visit a dinosaur bones museum. That is why I incorporated the Grierson quote at the beginning of this comment. Anyway hats off to the creators of it. ,pos
 **SPOILERS AHEAD** It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be such a disappointment. I thought this was full of (silly) clichés and that it basically tried to hard. To the (American) guys out there: how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds? To the (married) girls: how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with your husband? To the French: would you really ask about someone being à la fac when you know they don't speak French? Wouldn't you use a more common word like université ? I lived in France for a while and I sort of do know and understand Europe (and I love it) but my (German) roommate and I found this pretty insulting overall. It looked like a movie funded by the European Parliament and it tried too hard basically. It had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together (not a bad thing in itself) but the result is at best awkward but in fact ridiculous--too many clashes that wouldn't really happen. Then the end of the movie--the last 10 minutes--ruined all the rest. Why doesn't Xavier talk to the Erasmus students he meets back in Paris? Why does he just walk off? Why does he just run away from his job is that freedom ? And in the end is the new Europe supposed to rest on a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day? Is this what it's made up of? Besides the acting was pretty horrible. I can't believe Judith Godrèche's role and acting. Why was she made to look like Emanuelle Béart so much? At first I thought Xavier was OK but with retrospect I think he was pretty bad. And that's all really too bad because technically (opening credits scenes when he's asking what papers he needs) it was really good (except for sound editing around the British siblings) and the soundtrack was great too. So the form was good but the content pretty horrible. ,pos
 Thursday June 9 6:45pm Broadway Performance Hall & Saturday June 11 1:45pm Broadway Performance Hall Bless the independent filmmaker. Without them we'd see nothing but Spielberg the Farrelly brothers and films based on old sitcoms. They are the risk takers. They reap the rewards of success and suffer the failures. Max and Grace is most definitely a failure. Credit is deserved by Michael Parness for getting out there and making his first feature which he claims drove him to bankruptcy. He might be better off sticking to the stage if this film is any indication of what to expect in the future. Even though everyone warned me I went to see Max and Grace anyway hoping I might discover something they did not. It starts off well enough a party for Max in his parent's house shot in warm subdued light the camera floating into interesting angles. As soon as we see Max has hung himself an obvious rip-off of Harold and Maude the whole thing goes right in the tank. How could he do this unnoticed in the middle of a birthday party? For that matter how could two mentally ill and committed psychiatric patients decide to get married and do it with the blessings of all parties concerned? In the Q&A after the film David Krumholtz suggested the entire story was the surrealist dream of his character Max. This story is so badly written the comment sounded more like an excuse. The film doesn't look as though it was made on a shoestring all the more reason to be so disappointed with the results. What's intended as funny isn't but instead is offensively bad. The continuity is sloppy the lighting is dreadful and the effects look cheap and forced. BPH seats under three hundred and was surprisingly full but I saw at least thirty or forty walkouts within the first half-hour. At one point Grace played by Natasha Lyonne laments her inability to die. I found myself thinking the same thing since I never walk out before the credits. If Krumholtz really thinks this is one of the best scripts he has ever read it sounds like he needs to catch up on his reading. A terrible waste of talent and resources this is the worst independent I've seen since Bubba-Ho-tep. ,neg
 Continuing his comeback John Travolta played a mildly twisted angel in Michael . He may be a messenger of God but he's not the nicest guy as reporters Andie MacDowell and William Hurt discover. When I first saw this movie it was before I had started watching All in the Family so I didn't recognize Jean Stapleton as Edith Bunker. Now that I recognize her like that I try to imagine Archie snapping at her for harboring an angel (whom he would probably rank alongside blacks Jews etc). I know that doesn't really relate to the movie. But I just like to associate things that way. Anyway it's a pretty interesting movie. Also starring Bob Hoskins Teri Garr and Richard Schiff. What John and Paul said... ,pos
 This is one of Crichton's best books. The characters of Karen Ross Peter Elliot Munro and Amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting complex and fast-paced throughout this impressive novel. And about 99.8 percent of that got lost in the film. Seriously the screenplay AND the directing were horrendous and clearly done by people who could not fathom what was good about the novel. I can't fault the actors because frankly they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to Crichton's original work. I know good novels especially those with a science fiction edge are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original. But this may be the absolute worst disparity in quality between novel and screen adaptation ever. The book is really really good. The movie is just dreadful. ,neg
 First off I refuse to even consider this piece of work a Music video... I consider it a short film that uses excerpts of the song Thriller in its soundtrack. To me a music video must be no longer than the song itself and the song must play the entire length of the video. Calling this a music video is like calling The Great Gatsby a poem. On top of this... let's face it... thriller is a boring 14 minutes including the extremely dated werewolf transformation the mindless Vincent Price poem (just because VP recites it doesn't mean it's not lame) and the least threatening zombies I have ever seen. Sure this was certainly a cultural phenomenon but don't forget this also happened at the same time the A-Team was the #1 show on TV so lets not give the culture too much credit on that one... One last point on this film's impact on the media on music videos... what exactly did this add to the equation that Billie Jean and Beat It didn't already add? From what I can tell it only added the practice of stopping the song for some dialog or a superfluous dance scene... so you could say that all this video really did was give Puffy the inspiration to make more annoying music videos... Not quite my definition of great ,neg
 Since I am required to write minimum of 10 lines and this garbage deserves not only a single one I'll start with the following: 1. I voted AWFUL for this dreadful so called movie . 2. Let me explain why these turkeys Mr. David Varod produces are shot mainly in my beautiful homeland Bulgaria (just in BTW for the illiterate people around - this country is IN EUROPE based north to Greece and has absolutely nothing to do with Mexico and Uruguay) Some years ago NU Image has invaded our country and started making crappy mostly direct-to-video releases. Why here? Because here they pay derisively low fees to the Bulgarian crew and to the Bulgarian actors (most of them distinguished ones) which are in many ways better than most of their American colleagues. Personally I am ashamed of that fact. The reason is of course the greediness of the Americans involved and their wish to get most if not all of the profit. Actually it would't be so bad if only the production wasn't so filthy and pale. There hasn't been a good picture shot here for years. At present NU image is being sued here over the very questionably purchasing of our national cinema production centre called Boyana Films. No doubt about it there has been corruption there has been deceit there has been a lies in this recent purchase. The Bulgarian cinema is dead. Long live the Bulgarian cinema! ,neg
 Scanning through the comments there doesn't appear to be a lot of love for this movie and it's not very hard to see why it's rubbish. Now I will start by saying that the finished product was hurt in any number of ways by the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr Loomis) in post production. This required a re-jigging of the film's conclusion with Loomis buying the farm and took away what was supposed to be a double twist at the end with Micheal swapping places with mysterious Man in black and I do not mean Johnny Cash. Now to the story. The fifth movie ended rather unsatisfactorily with Micheal Myers escaping from jail with the mysterious man in black. It turns out (aggh) that this man knows the origin of Micheal's evil and is also a colleague of Dr Loomis named Dr Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in parts 4 and 5 but here played by JC Brandy). Jamie pregnant escapes from Dr Wynn's lair and so Micheal follows her and kills her. But she'd had the kid so now he needs to track the baby down so he can kill his great nephew. We hear some ludicrous explanation to Micheal's evil involving Gaelic curses down bloodlines and mysterious symbols. A radio show is broadcast from Micheal's home town for some reason which gives Micheal some more hapless victims. In the end the movie just like this review is vague confusing and directionless with a very anticlimactic ending. Some sex scenes and nudity. Poor plot passable effects with some good run of the mill slasher kills but severely lacking in motivation. For what was supposed to explain everything this only stirred up some new questions made parts 4 and 5 pointless and was a poor way for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and career. ,neg
 I absolutely ADORED this movie as a child and still do as an adult. To say that is even an understatement. My sister brother and I watched it one year at our grandparents' house during Christmas vacation. They had taped it from TV. Our parents were glad it kept us occupied for the one night but they thought we would tire of it and be ready for outdoor activities the next day. Not so! We became mesmerized. They could not have unglued us if they tried. It became a cherished yearly tradition. We loved everything about it: the time the romance the battle scenes the villains etc. Come on who can resist hating that psycho Bent with his constant SIR!? Classic! Moreover who can resist cheering wildly when Justin falls off the balcony?! What a triumphant moment! I always had a special place in my heart for Orry and Madelaine. They were so romantic. The theme song alone can get me to tear up a little. This movie is incredibly moving and I challenge anyone to stick with it until the very end. It's worth it!! ,pos
 The narrative was clear and concise but overall the film never caught my interest- scenes felt flat and uninspired.. Ghengis khan historically speaking had a very interesting/epic life but the film failed to capture that- instead focused on small skirmishes as a youth and a love story I think I've seen disguised in a slew of other films. I never felt sympathy nor empathy for the lead- yes he had to overcome slavery but then seemed to have an easy ride to khan- pillaging killing and double crossing his way to the top. The one redeeming quality was the photography- the landscapes certainly helped the bleak atmosphere of the film unfortunately combined with the bleakness of the story- I left unmoved and disappointed.. ,neg
 Cinema's greatest period started in post-War Europe with Italy's Neo-Realist movement. During the next 2 or 3 decades that followed France's New Wavers caught everyone's attention and there was always Bergman up there on his desolate Scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces. But in 1971 Luchino Visconti brought the art-form to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work *Death in Venice* which might as well be called *The Death of Europoean Cinema*. After the Sixties wound down so did the great European filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new American generation of Movie Brats (Coppola Scorsese & Co.). This movie absolutely feels like a grand summing-up not just of Visconti's particular obsessions but of the general attempt of European filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies. And rest assured you will find no sterner task-master than the Visconti revealed here. He's not playing to the crowd folks: either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind. The pacing is a challenge: slow but never without emotional weight. Incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm-und-drang cosmos. We will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies: one of the century's great writers who inspired the tale (Thomas Mann) one of the greatest filmmakers directing it (Visconti) one of the greatest actors in the lead role (Dirk Bogarde) and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background Gustav Mahler's 5th Symphony. Taking full advantage of Mahler's ability to inspire Romanticism in even the most cynical breast Visconti changes the main character Aschenbach into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer even making Bogarde up to LOOK like Mahler (geeky mustache specs shaggy hair duck-like walk). Bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies: it's a largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance -- a difficult trick without mugging like Chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse. Cinema just doesn't get better than this. I'll ignore the complaints from the Ritalin-addicts out there who say that it's too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of Aschenbach's flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced. The flashbacks fit neatly within the movie's thematic concerns (i.e. which is the better path to aesthetic perfection: passion or discipline?) and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers. (Of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway.) A nonstop stream of Mahler and beautiful dying Venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture; but this movie is actually about something. And what it's mostly about is suffering: Romantic (capital R) suffering in particular. As a suffering Romantic himself Visconti knew whereof he spoke. [SPOILER . . . I guess] If for nothing else see *Death in Venice* for its portentous opening credits . . . and for its unforgettable ending with Bogarde's jet-black hair-dye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalk-white face. Meanwhile off in the distance young Tadzio the object of Bogarde's dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a Michelangelo sculpture. The climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about: love lust beauty loss the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty. *Death in Venice* is a miraculous work of art. [DVD tip: as with the simultaneously released Visconti masterpiece *The Damned* I recommend that you turn the English subtitles ON while watching this movie. It's ostensibly in English but the DVD's sound seems muddy and there's a lot of Italian spoken during the film anyway.] ,pos
 I didn't see this movie until it appeared on television because I was doubtful about comic flicks. Ever since the Batman series Spawn Judge Dredd and many other pitiful p.g.-13 bombs I dodged everything at all cost. I would question in my mind why can't someone make a movie that is rated R and stays true to the story how difficult is that? And finally my prayers have been answered with Blade. This movie pops right out of the pages onto the screen with sheer violence blood martial arts weapons fire the good against evil etc. Yeah sure a lot of action flicks contain all these goodies and most of them have bombed. But not Blade the movie was filmed just right not going overboard delivering a good length and never a dull moment. Blade II is cool but not as cool as the first. Blade is indeed one of the best real comic flicks I've seen in a long time. ,pos
 excellent drama. very dark. i have never seen california photographed in such a way. bridget fonda as the deaf wife beaten by her husband is superb. the film gripped me from start to finish. very understated performance by sutherland. the direction was very european. amazing to get such a performance from fonda. ,pos
 I agree that this is ONE of the very best episodes of the entire series--my only detraction would be the somewhat jarring appearance of Mark Lenard as the Romulan Commander. My reasoning is this--if you were not around for the first run of this episode then you know Mr. Lenard as Sarek Spock's father. And for the 2nd generation Trekkie (or Trekker--your preference) it takes you out of the scene at first. Yet he's an excellent commander as well as opposite for our captain and this episode is strongly written and well-acted by all. There are excellent points made by both sides about the cost of war vs.the price of peace and certainly does remind one of some of the best of the WWII and later era movies. Those are not my favorite genre but I certainly would recommend a fan of such to view this episode through that filter. You'll see it holds up. I'll never understand why Sci-Fi gets so little respect--the best drama comes out of placing ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. ,pos
 The theatrics and the drama included in the movie is fantastic but the facts and the research is far from solid. When quoting Dr. Bovon where the documentary tries to establish a connection to Mary Magdalene from Mariamene Dr. Bovon later clarifies it should be used for literary purposes (ie: fables of that time) not for a historical figure. In fact he states he does NOT believe the Mariamene ossuary in Talpiot is Mary Magdalene. He further comments on his public letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this documentary but rather for information regarding Acts of Philip (a literary work in the 4th century). So what we have here is a director that took one clip for a 4th century Acts of Philip fantasy and used it specifically to support a 1st century ossuary inscription. A very sad stretch and Dr. Bovon calls the Jesus/Mary Magdalene connection as science fiction -- as this documentary should be rightly labeled. ,neg
 I wasn't expecting much because of the harsh reviews and proceeded to enjoy the movie a great deal as a result. Softer colors and less stunning compositions of the shots than some of his previous films in my opinion allowed the narrative to take the focus. Though the religious conflict in a vampire flick was commonplace I felt like many of the other things were not. For example: how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her. the very strong and well acted love scenes. the symbolism of the man they killed to get closer to each other actually separating them even more. Their strong differences of what it means to be 'vampire' created by their prior life experiences. the lack of scores of other vampires appearing or being created through the movie. I've heard and read several things about 'tricks used in other films'. Of course. However i feel that tricks are used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and I feel that he does this well. I don't need a director to use new tricks. I prefer that the tricks that are used are used well and appropriately which i feel is the case with this film. I recommend it. ,pos
 I was just lucky I found this movie. I've been taking advantage of Walmart's $5.50 DVDs because I watch a lot of movies (and very seldom watch television). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who served in Vietnam. This movie really illustrates the pain I've seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there. I wish more people would see this movie - I think maybe more people could understand what happened to our Vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war. The story felt realistic - it isn't mushy but made me feel what they were going through. I think it helped that Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez were playing father and son - it made their relationship more believable  ,pos
 This film is about a young Indian guy who comes home one day and finds himself getting engaged to a woman. The problem is that he is gay. In order to stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay one lie leads to another until it spirals out of control. This film is hilarious and got me laughing many times. Sally Bankes' acting is superb and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants convincingly. The plot is outstanding as well. I find the plot very realistic and I can completely identify with Jimi's feeling of being terrified worried and upset. On the other hand Jimi's boyfriend Jack is given much less attention in the film. I would have liked him to be given more lines in the film and have more character development. However as I guess the director wants to make this a more mainstream film the love between Jimi and Jack was not developed in the film. It is great to watch a gay affirmative film. Furthermore this film preaches us to be accepting to other people's difference be it sexuality culture and the way of life. This film makes viewers think hard. We need films like this to give us a boost. Thanks for making this film! ,pos
 This movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in Russia. Epic movie about Russian culture Great saga of Russian spirit endless articles and interviews. For me this movie was the biggest disappointment. The main character played by Oleg Menshikov is a stupid immature boy ready to set up his comrades because of a woman who doesn't even look like a lady. What is there to admire? In the first part of the movie the story doesn't develop at all. People's festival scenes look like boasting about Russian audacity. I respect Mr. Mikhalkov for his previous works both as actor and director but this movie just demonstrates his ambitions to be considered the Tzar of Russian cinema. ,neg
 with two old friends. I've always enjoyed both Lemmon's and Mathaeu's films and of course their team efforts are always worth watching and often hilarious. Although I didn't personally regard this film as in the hilarious category it is certainly a competent and entertaining vehicle for fans of the two principle actors and of 60s style romantic comedy plots. Brent Spiner may actually steal the show in terms of laughs as the arrogant and tyrannical Cruise Director. Gloria DeHaven proves that senior ladies can remain enormously attractive. ,pos
 Alice enters in a world of wonder... but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid. The Mad Hatter the White Rabbit the Queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body -- and other people's bodies -- that might be quite wonderful. A tale of love and lust the likes you've never seen. Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I must say by 1970s standards this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day. I believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work but it was pretty much the best possible one she could have chosen (my love for all things Alice is no secret). Even better than Fairy Tales (which isn't really pornography so much). The songs are cheesy but fit the theme of the movie. One song What's a Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This? was pretty funny and the others had similar themes going. The trial towards the end was well scripted and fit very nicely into the world of Alice. The logic and humor were definitely accounted for. What more can you say about a film like this? All I know is for people who are used to adult films where it's just a 30-second lead-in to the sex this one is going to overload you with plot and music. But personally I think there's something very special about this film and I hope it gets a nice DVD release with things touched up and special features (if that's even possible). I can see this being a cult film. ,pos
 As far as I am concerned this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs I am used to viewing: 1 - the setting is Paris France; 2 - there is 28-minute scene with no dialog. Both make this movie a bit unique at least to English-speaking film noir fans. Actually an American Jules Dussain shot the film so it's not entirely a European film. Initially I was disappointed in this after I had watched the first 40 minutes. It's an expensive DVD and I was bored. However once that silent segment started - the actual heist (you already know what's it about) the film picked up considerably and just got better and better. In fact I thought the best part of the story was what happened after the heist. The best aspect of the entire film was the cinematography. This is what makes the disc worth owning. It's excellent film noir photography and a real travelogue for those of us who have never seen Paris...and this is Paris in the mid 1950s. There are lots of bleak-but-interesting rain-soaked Paris streets and buildings I found fascinating to view. In fact there were many more of those great shots than of London in the much better known film The Third Man. The lead actor in here Jean Servais I think his name is also is interesting to view. Someone described his face as a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Harry Dean Stanton and that sums it up perfectly. A warning for those not expecting profanity or nudity in a classic film. This is France not the United States so there is a little bit of both in here. I appreciate the DVD offering the choice of subtitles or a dubbed version too. ,pos
 In my opinion National Velvet is one of the top family classic's of all time. It features Mickey Rooney as (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). Velvet wins a race horse named (Pie) in a raffle. She falls in love with it right away. With the help of Mi an ex-jockey they train it to race in the Grand National's. After the jockey who was scheduled to race Pie backs out at the last moment Mi convinces Velvet to take his place. This was a well put together motion picture. Fine storyline and top notch acting. The inner play between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family picture expertly Directed by Clarence Brown. The photography is stunning. This is a movie you will enjoy for years to come. This picture is what made Elizabeth Taylor a household name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth remained close after the film. They still send post cards to each other after all these many years. One side note. Elizabeth loved the horse Pie so much that the studio gave it to her. ,pos
 Jimmy Stewart was a real life pilot WWII flier and a one-star general in the Air Force and therefore a natural for how real pilots react when they fly. When you see the faithful recreation of the actual plane you begin to understand the real-life bravery and courage of Lucky Lindy when he flew the Atlantic solo in 1927! ,pos
 After watching Caddyshack 1 I'd heard there was a sequel and decided to look it up. The movie seemed pretty bad and I told myself to stay away but stupid me gave in and actually bought the damn thing! All the reviews and everything bad you've heard about Caddyshack II are true. The movie is simply worn of ideas and the lamest plot and jokes I've ever heard the gopher the acting the whole movie really is bad (Randy Quaid was funny though). Just stay away from this movie as much as you can is all I can really say. I deeply regret watching and buying the DVD but not sure which was the worser decision. Just stay away as much as possible. ,neg
 Nishabd means wordless. This must be the condition of the script before the shooting of this film started and therefore throughout this film cries for content. What you go for is an unusual love story between a 60-yr old man and an 18-yr old girl and what you get are very usual very common events that neither excite nor surprise. So what we are left finally is with picturesque locations of Kerala shot brilliantly by cinematographer Amit Roy and camera friendly histrionics of newfound Jiah Khan. This does not cover up for lack of a concrete script. Producer-Director Ram Gopal Varma who has such a good track record of films needs to pull up his socks. As far as Mr. Bachchan goes I don't want to discuss him in context of this film. While reviewing I am feeling loss of words. I am left speechless rather wordless ! Personal Opinion : This film can be compared with an equally bad film released some time back called BLACK. I don't see the difference between the histrionics of lead characters in both the films. What did you say just now- That was a world-class cinema blah blah and I don't have any taste. Well take a walk. No I don't mean literally but actual one to the theaters showing this film. Because in that case you might find this film an Oscar-level material. ,neg
 I usually steer clear of Film Festivals and don't enjoy slap-stick comedy but I must say that this picture was great. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz from the TV show Numbers and Lorraine Bracco Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black were at their usual best. This is comedy at an incredibly high level with visual spoken and satirical interludes that kept the audience and me laughing throughout a rather deep rooted plot. Kudos to Mr. Parness for dealing with a delicate but real subject in a manner that can be enjoyed but fully absorbed by his audience at every level of intellect. The plot stays intact throughout the film and the comedic relief adds to the message without being laid on so thick as to distort. The blending of segways is done beautifully and the overall product is wonderfully tasteful. I can definitely state that this film is one that will go a long way and should be seen by audiences of all ages; the problem is real and so is the powerful impact of this production. ,pos
 I suspect there's some revisionist history going on here but one definitely comes away with the feeling that Patrice Lumumba was a trouble-maker who incited his people to violence from the moment the Congo declared independence.His inability to control his people and his decision to bring in Soviet help to get his military back in line was obviously what got the United States involved and led to his assassination.However by replacing him with Mobutu the United States didn't solve anything.They made the situation just as bad.Well-acted with excellent cinematography and a rousing score.Definitely worth seeing. ,pos
 Sorry for all you guys that are not family with the Lynches. My sister in law asked me how you can make just a disturbing movie. I told her that if the daughter and her father would not do these movie they would have instead to go around and kill and cut people in pieces. After every Lnych movie I tell myself again one and a half hour lost of my life. But next time I will check the director's or producers name. So you don't want to be angry at yourself and loose time don't watch it. But if you think that you need to kill someone watch it this is probably a better medicine than to spend your whole life in a prison for mentally insane. ,neg
 I bought this thing used at a video game store's clearance bin . I wanted to get that guilty feeling from watching something I've been warned is too intense to watch; I wanted the shock value. I wanted to feel guilty and bad about watching a banned film . I was very disappointed. Cannibal Ferox does not work because it is so campy and fake. Most of the time the camera does not show you the shocking stabs chops slicing - you just see the aftermath. (They do show a breast hooking in detail). The special effects are just OK. Nothing here that tells you any of the violence is real. The cannibals are obviously poor people from central / south America who were dressed up as jungle savages and told to act mean. These people were obviously in on the whole picture to get a little money or food or both. Again...just not convincing. However like everyone else has said there is some real killing of animals going on here. That is the extent of the realism. To me that was more shocking than any gutting chopping of scalps or castration and even then the animal deaths are not that gory at all - maybe just sad. ,neg
 -love is hard to find in this fast food society that we live in so man called Hitch makes it duty to help men find love with women that they are beyond madly in love with. his rules are that he only helps you find love and not just some casual sex which seems like a great deal but soon word begins to spread around and people begin to get the wrong idea about what he does which begins to complicate the relationship with woman he just met that he is madly in love with. -I have to say it's really nice to see Will Smith in a movie that doesn't have him trying to save the world from aliens or robots. There are no jaw dropping effects nor is he showing off his beefed up body. He's just a normal human being in this movie which was really nice. He doesn't necessarily stretch his acting muscles in this movie but then again the story doesn't call for that but all the same it was nice to see him relaxed and not showing off his ripped body to make those of us without six packs jealous. His character here is as with all his characters likable witty and very charming which is something that almost all the characters in this odd love tale seem to share. The Kevin James character is just a regular guy that needs help hooking up with the girl of his dreams which really makes you feel for the guy and root for him every step of the way. the only character that was a sore spot for me was the Mendez character because she's so cold and calculated that it's hard to believe that Smith could fall for her. He must love a challenge I guess. -now this is the part of the review in which I'll make a joke about how I would never need Hitch because I'm such a player but I just got through writing about 16 reviews for another web site plus I'm still working on a little project so I'm a little jaded right now. whiles the movie is packed with enough charm and likable characters with funny lines it slowly but surely falls into the sea of formulaic romantic movies in which after the big scene where the terrible secret comes out everyone is forgiven and the relationship is even better than before. But hey there's like 4000 movies about the underdog overcoming adversity so I guess one more movie having a predictable ending that's been done to almost death doesn't cause much harm. I really like the message of the movie as well because in the end you don't need a formula to get the right girl just be yourself and all will fall into play which is theme of the movie and why it works so well. I'm sure if it had turned out that the James character gets the girl after following everything that the Smith character said then it would have being a pretty empty movie but as it stands it works really well. -despite being predictable this is a PERFECT date movie. It's sweet it's funny and it's romantic so anyone that watches this movie on a date should be getting some after it's over. and by some I mean sex ,pos
 Based on actual events of 1905 silent film THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN concerns an Imperial Russian ship on which abominable conditions lead to a mutiny. Shocked by conditions on the ship citizens of the port city Odessa rally to the mutineers' support--and in consequence find themselves at the mercy of Imperial forces who attack the civilian supporters with savage force. POTEMKIN is a film in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members and it achieves its incredible power by showing the clash of the groups and crowds in a series of extraordinarily visualized and edited sequences. Amazingly each of these sequences manage to top the previous one and the film actually builds in power as it moves from the mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the Odessa steps--the latter of which is among the most famous sequences in all of film history. Filming largely where the real events actually occurred director Eisenstein's vision is extraordinary as he builds--not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each sequence--some of the most memorable images ever committed to film. To describe POTEMKIN as a great film is something of an understatement. It is an absolute essential an absolute necessity to any one seriously interested in cinema as an art form purely visual cinema at its most brilliant often imitated seldom equaled never bested.

 I haven't watched this show in months but for a while I was forced to watch it every day because I had a roommate that liked it. So maybe it's undergone some vast improvement in all that time although the commercials and the 4.2 rating on IMDb aren't a good sign. It was clearly just a quick replacement for Chappelle's Show. Even Mencia says so. And while I wasn't even that big a fan of Chappelle's Show his jokes were at least original and clever (and far edgier than Mencia has ever been). Mencia's jokes are completely unoriginal and stale. If you can't see that I guess there's just no hope for you. But to be fair here are some examples: --Mencia blatantly rips off Chapelle's Lil Jon skit. Just takes it. -- South Park makes an episode about scientology. One week later Mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to scientologists. Bear in mind the joke isn't ABOUT scientologists but about how much he's offended them on his show. When up to this point he has never made a single scientology joke ever. --After Hurricane Katrina two AP photos go around the Internet showing a black man looting groceries and a white woman finding them. WEEKS later after millions of people have already seen this Mencia presents it on his show as if he discovered it and it's being shown for the first time (the Daily Show would have been on something like that in a day). Pathetic. Even more annoying than the joke-stealing is the way Carlos has promoted himself and his show claiming he's breaking down some sort of PC barrier (whatever) and that if you aren't laughing you must be a weak prude who can't handle any jokes about race. Yes Carlos it's not because you're not funny it's because we're all too offended to laugh (if that was really true then why was Chappelle's Show so popular?). He constantly berates his audience for not getting it if he doesn't get enough laughs and often repeats and EXPLAINS his jokes a technique most comedians stop using by age 14. The worst part is that Mencia does not seem to be very intelligent. It's sort of tragic that there are dozens of funnier more insightful comedians out there trying to make it while this guy is rolling in money. His show is supposedly the third highest rated on Comedy Central which is baffling (again it has a 4.2 rating on this site). Where the hell are they getting these numbers?? Comedy Central tries to bill itself as an edgy station but as long as it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible that will never be the case. ,neg
 This movie has to be seen for the music which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Obviously the original soundtrack is not exactly hi-fi but there are many excellent versions available in classical music selections. The cantata can be appreciated for itself but having seen the movie helps. The story itself is fairly standard Soviet wartime anti-German propaganda. An amusing anecdote is that Stalin was later so eager to buy time by appeasing Hitler at the onset of World War II that Eisenstein was seconded to a German movie for a short while as penance. Prince Alexander Nevsky (revered as a saint by the Russian Orthodox) having earned his nickname by defeating Swedish raiders on the river Neva musters Russian resistance against an invasion by the Teutonic knights and concludes his victory with a stern warning to other would-be invaders. An interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians being taken as slaves by Mongolian soldiers and does nothing to stop this as the Teutonic knights are his priority. The historical Alexander Nevsky paid tribute to the Mongol khans as his father before him while working to consolidate his realm's future independence. ,pos
 Again like many other TV Shows a certain actor/actresses in thrust into the limelight in this case Miranda Cosgrove having built up her reputation in previous Movies/Series (especially by Nickelodeon and Dan Schneider. She is now the star of the show gets to sing the soundtrack ( which she DID NOT WRITE and thus gets even more fame from that). Wonderful? It creates as much imbalance in popularity vs her other co-stars especially Nathan Kress who is continually thrust into minor rolls in each episode except iDont Want to Fight. Cosgrove's music would never have met the charts without this show and her singing the main theme song (which was not written by her) and other covers such as About You Now and Stay my Baby. Let's not forget that she lip sync/sings her song live too. Is that how you create vocalist nowadays? Back to the show Cosgrove reveals more physically by acting scenes in a bikini Hawaiian hula type bra and mentioned bra many times through out. Bras and seen in many cases (though not of the other actresses). Wedgies are mentioned panties have been mentioned once. Og let us not forget Oh My God a come phrase (are any of the scriptwriters/actors Christian?) Granted that the show is not meant to be just for kids I'm surprised at the multitude of mentions of the female undergarment especially in the first episode where the phrase pointy boobs were mentioned. I'm not sure whether kids would thus refrain from saying that at home/in school afterwards. It's not that I'm against the mentioning or showing of female undergarments (which girls will wear) but for a show from Nickelodeon the people in charge should have realised that kids would get the exposure to such stuff. I doubt that other Nickelodeon shows have such content in them. As mentioned is other reviews the laughter track is extremely annoying and unnecessary in many parts--for example when the character Sam cries how on earth is that a time to laugh? It distracts people from getting the joke and is used almost in every sentence. As mentioned Cosgrove is made the star of the show and thus gains the utmost fame and support from die hard fans who even scolded a hotel staff when she is told to keep her noise level down (see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk0gtfUk98U). Jennette McCurdy is the second star of the show but she faces competition from Cosgrove in the music industry (compare the popularity of her new single vs Cosgrove's covers). As noted the third co-star Nathan Kress is the least noted of the lot. He is portrayed as a atypical boy who suffers the brunt of bullying by a girl and other boys but somehow a wizard at technology. His height in early episodes make him a cute actor but unusual given his character's crush on Carly/Cosgrove. Beyond that Kress isn't breaking into the music industry and as Cosgrove's fame grows with each episode Kress falls behind. I would bet that he is the least paid of all the three actors. The content of the show is of course fictional but also lets one wonder how it fits into a comedy series at certain times (thus the laughter track is used).It also contains several continuity errors (how can your father be and Air Force Colonel on a submarine? US Special Forces have their own branches and the Air Force doesn't use US submarines--that is for SEALs). A unique feature is that of allowing viewers to submit their own videos to be shown during or after the episodes but again the videos somehow do not meet the theme of comedy. Once again it is a show that is riddled with mentions of the female undergarments exposure of skin and over used laughter tracks. It is a series which thrusts a teen actress so far into the crowd such that her songs/actions are excessive supported by her fans leaving her co Stars behind. ,neg
 This movie plays out like an English version of an ABC after school special with nudity. It makes you wonder who the target audience was supposed to be. It's not as though the writers were too preoccupied with selling a plausible plot either. While it does possess a certain watchability Virtual Sexuality is fluffier than dandelion meringue. It's a good movie to watch if you're snowed in the cable's out and it's the only tape you've got. ,neg
 Hellraiser: Bloodline is where the sequel mediocrity of the Hellraiser series well and truly sets in. Gone is the imagination and invention of the first two movies. Gone is the ethos of Pinhead and his minions. Gone are the sick desires of humans. In fact everything that once made Hellraiser so original has been trashed by this mess of a picture. All that is left is that basic premise of Christian mythology that there is a Hell with evil Demons. What happened to the evil that men do? This watered down excuse for a Hellraiser movie is padded out with endless Psycho Babble so that Pinhead becomes a nonsense spouting philosopher and not the harbinger of doom as he is meant to be. The film uses the most basic of film formulas with characters separating and getting individually killed. Pinhead is not Alien. The link between the box and the 'demons' or 'Hell' is never established it just arrives at a sacrifice and sits on a sideboard. The lead female Character is called 'Rimmer' and the producers obviously think it really funny because everyone keep saying her name. Really the film should have been retitled to give it that characters name. Shame on you Kevin Yagher and Alan Smithee. ,neg
 A rather lame teen slasher from Brisbane. While the plot hinges on a fairly decent idea the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden. The problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown but if they were that devil-may-care it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable so they end up being neither really. In fact I only started enjoying the film when I started wishing for their death. One of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police. I realise we wouldn't have a movie if they did but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldn't. Avoid. ,neg
 I'm all about the walking dead but my mind is still unsure of the walking frozen dead. Sadly THE CHILLING didn't help me make up my mind. This is really slow with nothing happening for the first 45 minutes making me hit the film enhancement button several times. By the time the well designed zombies show up it is too late and the director (two are rumored to have filmed this) has no idea how to shoot them. Haggerty Blair and Donahue all look tired/embarrassed/recovering in some fashion. I will give the film credit as it predates the T2 ending with villains being frozen by liquid nitrogen. The Shriek Show DVD offers an extended promo reel from back in the day that runs 8 minutes long and I would actually recommend that over watching the flick in its entirety. ,neg
 The plane is a 747 Jumbo. The cockpit is located on the upper deck on a 747. In the movie the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st Class cabin to reach the cockpit. They walk to the front of the 1st Class cabin and through doors into the cockpit. What a gaff !!! The front of the first class cabin has a cloakroom for jackets and a TV screen. Beyond that is the radar dome. Before takeoff a 747 is shown to commence the taxi to the runway. On take-off the plane is shown to have only two engines. Areal 747 has four engines. Who was in charge of continuity on this movie ? During the early part of the flight the front of the plane suddenly includes toilets - another farcical gaff !!! After that the front of the plane becomes the rear and vice-versa. At this point I stopped watching. Absolute rubbish!!! ,neg
 The Capture Of Bigfoot is one of the silliest and worst movies of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot movies but this one is just a sheer waste of one's time.Terrible terrible terrible!I watched this movie last night and it was all I could do to finish watching.I understood that this weird crazy man wanted to capture Bigfoot but that was the only thing that made sense in this movie.It did have some amusing parts though.There was this very cheesy and corny disco club with very bad disco dancing that seemed to go on for far too long in the movie.I think the director was trying to fill time.The worst thing was the way the Bigfoot looked.The obvious man in a suit looked like a pink faux fur Bigfoot.It was laughable.If you want to see a very bad Bigfoot movie then I suggest that you purchase this movie.Personally I wasted my time and my money on this one! ,neg
 Leon Errol handles his double role of Uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping superbly but I have trouble liking the Mexican Spitfire Series because they all are contrived to produce mistaken identities and these are telegraphed way in advance. Errol is funny as the stuffy Lord Epping but I would have preferred a lot more wit and much less repetition. ,neg
 'Radio' is a beautiful movie based on a real story of the mentally challenged James Robert Kennedy nicknamed 'Radio' and the football coach from the T.L. Hanna High School Harold Jones. Cuba Gooding Jr. is excellent as Radio! I would never imagine to see him in a serious performance specially because most of the movies I watch with him are comedies. Ed Harris is great as Harold Jones but this actor IS great so this is not anything new. The mentally challenged young man called James Robert Kennedy always walk around the T.L. Hanna High School without bothering anyone and almost not noticed. One day when the football's ball is throw near him he decides to stay with the ball for the impatience of Johnny Cash one of the best players from the football team and also one of the most unpleasant guys you would ever met. One day Cash decides to punish James mocking him with other football players and even go so far as to tie him up. When coach Jones discovers that horrible act he stays angry and punish all the team deciding for this day on to help James who gets the nickname 'Radio' because of his passion for radios in general. The movie shows how Radio becomes an adept assistant helping the team train despite hardships from the players and even getting respect from basically all the people who lives in the small city. I would recommend this movie for everybody who wants to watch a real and beautiful story. It has a life lesson specially showing us how a person can make a difference even not being what we call ''normal''. Radio has a big heart and is incapable to hate anyone and that's a thing that we all should apply to our daily lives. ,pos
 Those who dislike this film seem to think that a loved one somehow 'belongs' to them and must be discarded if they go off with someone else. Fortunately human nature is much deeper than that; loving someone deeply inevitably brings suffering - though if we are fortunate only on their death. This film is true in setting atmosphere and dialogue to Nigel Balchin's original novel ('A Way Through The Wood') and by pinpointing a seemingly irreconcilable dilemma captures the quiet desperation that lies behind many seemingly idyllic lives (and the depiction of English upper class country life is very accurate). I loved the film and hope it will appear soon as an UK-compatible DVD ,pos
 Flipping through the channels I was lucky enough to stumble upon the beginning of this movie. I must admit that it grabbed my attention almost immediately. I love older films and this is or should be considered a classic! One of the most wonderful rarities of this movie is that the main character was not only female but she was also a bad girl. I highly recommend this movie! ,pos
 A poorly-paced sf/horror venture that takes itself much too seriously memorable only for (a) the beautiful Mathilda May wandering around naked through the chaos and (b) terrible miscasting. It has a few mildly gruesome effects and startling moments and some unintentionally funny scenes but is mostly a waste of time. ,neg
 This was the most thought-provoking capital-punishment movie ever! It refused to seem one-sided and the emotions felt throughout the story are as real as it can get. This movie had one of the most 'human' (And I use this term in a good way) compassionate religious character ever! This movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book (Which is rare for me). Sister Helen exerted more of a spiritual tone than a religious(Which is also rare). And it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldn't feel that a point was left out. And we have the director to thank for that. This is not a film for entertainment. But it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart. I can't think of another film like it. ,pos
 Cooley High is considered one of my best all time movies. It certainly reminds me of days of my youth growing up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago during the early mid and late 1960's. What ever happened to Brenda and Pooter? Some one need's to track those two down. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for his innocent wit. They both deserve to be recognized even 31 years after this film was debuted. I think a lot of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them as well as others who acted in this fun filled movie. I certainly think this movie should be entered into some type of MOVIE HALL OF FAME. All of the cast of this movie was great. My opinion is of Cooley High is turn back the hands of time those were the fun years. ,pos
 This film is a perfect example of great escapism! I loved this film and was sucked in from the very beginning. Sure it's just an action flick but isn't having fun what watching movies is all about? The cast of this film are very strong with likable characters. The friendship between the boys is so realistic and appealing it's heart warming and hilarious to see a group of teenage boys interact - especially this group of boys!! Sean Astin makes a great rebel successfully avoiding being a precocious teenager. If you want fun watch this film! I thoroughly enjoyed it even though I was watching it on a very dirty and old VHS that was terrible quality (Go DVD's!) ,pos
 Not just because of that theme in the movie. Which was one of the lame excuses for something reminiscent of plot. No. I watched this knowing I would not like it. I HATE numerology. Whenever someone starts going off about patterns with numbers I feel the urge to slap them. My own brain starts hurting out of empathy. And fully aware this is a movie just about that topic I couldn't resist the urge to watch it and maybe get a good laugh. But it wasn't funny. Just exactly the dumb sort of Isn't this totally scary and yet amazingly cool?! I can turn any crap into 23! dialog I was afraid of. As soon as the son started to chime in I knew this movie is a turd no matter what happens. But I hardly ever stop watching a movie I started. I sat through it. I enjoy the pain. The movie pretends to mock numerology under the disguise of showing how obsession can end badly. But it rides that wave as much as it's supposed to crush it. I don't see that message. I only see characters raving about a stupid number with little plot to justify. Top that off with the usual surprises - trying to put another twist to throw you off that makes no sense and you almost believe it due to the quality of the narration up to there - and you get one hollow piece of movie-making. That just happens to be centered around the topic I despise. If only it did not try to be serious and rather had been some hilarious movie with actors I don't give a damn about. But I was starting to like Carrey...while it's not his fault he is trying. It's not even good for watching with a bunch of friends and mst3k the hell out of it. My expectations were low enough for someone to trip on them but this movie managed to live up to be one of the worst I've ever seen. ,neg
 'The English Patient' is a love story set in Europe as World War II ends... It is a wartime romance mystery epic like 'Hiroshima Mon Amour ' 'The Sweet Hereafter ' and 'After Life.' Anthony Minghella weaves extravagant beauty around a central character whose condition is grotesque and puts emotional barriers between the characters and the audience... This adult love story is an intimate portrait in the tradition of 'Casablanca' and 'Dr. Zhivago.' The film sweeps gracefully attaining a level of eroticism and emotional connection that many similar films had missed... Told in flashback it is a masterpiece of intimate moment and spectacular largesse... Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient Count Laszlo de Almasy a Hungarian cartographer of few words who works for the British government and is stationed in the North African desert... Count Laszlo is the unidentified survivor of a plane crash turned over to the Allies taken into custody by a medical convoy in Italy and essentially left to die in peace in an isolated monastery in Tuscany under the care of an inspiring pretty nurse who injects him with morphine and reads to him a book considered his great treasure and his one surviving possession... Hana seeks to stimulate his touching memories wrapped up in his head released in lost pieces from his disturbed mind... Fiennes gives a haunted pained performance playing the young man whose veneer of charm cannot plainly cover his heart's capacity for passion... He makes us sympathize with the character in showing self-doubt and weakness... As a badly burned man he has only cherished memories... His joy and heartbreak are completely clear and visible in his eyes... He remembers falling under the spell of an attractive English married woman... He remembers the way this turns him from a harsh abrupt wanderer into a man willing to betray everything for love... His tragic love affair forms the heart of the motion picture... Kristin Scott Thomas matches Fiennes' work with a radiant sensuality... She is captivating as the married European woman conveying the audience with the energy and enthusiasm for life that the Count finds irresistible... Their different world despairing and hopeful menacing and resilient is simply beautiful... With intense passion and intelligence this attractive blonde burns the screen as the different wife... Juliette Binoche seems to shine as the French-Canadian nurse full of life and energy... This vibrant young woman has a heart of gold kissing wounded soldiers but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her... Colin Firth is good as Katherine's husband... He is a British spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole North African continent... He quickly becomes friend of the Count yet when he realizes that his wife has committed adultery his face reflected a peaceful fury... William Dafoe plays a double-agent spy who covers his anger with a strange charm... He is a crippled war veteran who has a hidden agenda... This cunning Canadian man seems to know of some dark secret in Almasy's past... He believes the 'English patient' is partially responsible for the mutilation of his hands and is busy seeking revenge on everyone even remotely involved... Naveen Andrews is Hana's ardent lover He is a handsome Sikh and an explosives expert with a dangerous job There's a scene that is stuck in my head because it literally had me on the edge of my seat for what seemed an eternity In this particular scene the military sapper has to cut the wires on a bomb that has been hidden on a bridge It's on a timer and he only has a few minutes left The scene cuts back and forth between his tense face the wires and his dirty fingers as they try madly to figure out how to untangle and cut the wires without detonating the bomb All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence in The English Patient. John Seale's cinematography is breathtaking and Gabriel Yared's majestic music is dreamy and romantic This is a rich motion picture with ambition and style a fever dream lyrical and complex We are almost able to feel the heat of the desert the pain of the burnings the intimate flush of humanity that becomes the most haunting element of this epic love story... ,pos
 I hadn't planned on leaving a review but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie I had to say something. I'm not going to give away the ending or anything but I do give away some important plot points in this review so you should be aware of that. The short (non-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both kick butt in this movie and it's a lot of fun. Watch it. This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Geena Davis is perfect as the action heroine torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother and the memories that are resurfacing of her former life as a CIA Assassin. Her performance is superb as she plays both facets of this relatively complex character perfectly. Samuel L. Jackson's performance is as always also excellent as the Private Investigator that Geena Davis' character hired to look into her forgotten past. He does a great job of playing the unwitting sidekick to Geena Davis' tough character. Some of the lines he utters in this movie are the best he's ever used in any movie he's been in. Seriously if you haven't seen it do. It's a fantastic story with lots of unexpected twists and turns and it's extremely well directed and acted. ,pos
 The movie was supposed to release in 2002 and was much awaited due to the promos but it finally released in 2003 after the producer died The movie is good in parts but overall isn't great The scenes between Rani and Ajay are okay but the other scenes are not well handled The film is too similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood and though this was planned before that got released first so originality is lost Milan Luthria disappoints overall after KACHCHE DAAGE Music is good but too many songs Ajay Devgan looks jaded and his appearance gives away that the film was delayed and his acting looks boring too Rani is good Sonali is good too rest are okay ,neg
 Robert Montgomery-Myrna Loy farce about Loy (Irene) and her fiancé played by Reginald Owen stranded in Labrador when their plane crashes. (That's really what should have happened to this highly predictable film.) Montgomery lives there while he is waiting for his fiancé. Surprise! Montgomery and Loy are soon attracted to each other. The scene with the bear is so contrived. We knew it was a tamed bear all along. Complications ensue when Clara shows up. Loy wants Montgomery to tell Clara that they should part ways when he refuses she wants to leave at once. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out how this will end. Out with all that snow it's just too cold for anyone! ,neg
 I remember watching this movie when it came out as a t.v. movie of the week in the early 1970's. Although I haven't seen this movie in over 30 years I remember how creepy it was...the sister's dead body in the basement the storm raging outside the creepy house with no electricity and a killer still on the premises. They just don't make t.v. movies like this one anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underrated actress and I liked her in not only Betwitched but several of her post-Bewitched roles such as this one and 1975's The Legend of Lizzie Borden . I really wish that someone would come out with a DVD that has several of the 1970's t.v. movie of the week on one DVD. Wouldn't it be awesome to watch When Michael Calls Bad Ronald Don't Be Afraid of the Dark Crowhaven Farm etc. all on one DVD? I know there is a market for a DVD like this for all of us baby boomers who grew up in the 1960's and 1970's. Maybe if we are lucky someday someone will offer us a DVD with a great selection of t.v. movies like this. ,pos
 This movie was astonishing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary and the acting spectacular. At first I thought this wasn't going to be that great because of a summary but after about the first five or ten minutes of the movie it struck me that I was dead wrong. I literally cried about four or five times in this movie and despite this I must've watched the same scenes over and over again about thirty times in one week! No the song scenes were not as awesome as they could've been but the plot is what really gets you. American or Asain I would recommend this to anyone--and I have now. I guarantee that after seeing this one you'll get the best out of it and its plot. I hope you feel the same and write a rave review too! ,pos
 Most of Kieslowski's films seem like puzzles to me meant to expand mind and soul. The characters are not very believable are idealized are schematic. Nevertheless the way Kieslowski presents their winding ways through life their complicated interaction with others with the universe with chance or destiny makes me understand faith makes me (want to) believe in God. That at some point it all has a meaning if not to me then certainly to someone. Trois couleurs and especially Rouge comes closer to making me touch feel experience the truth the meaning than perhaps any other of his films. The only problem being the paths of the puzzles explored are a bit too similar to his other films and at some point they become somewhat predictable. There is still plenty of joy to be had here. It is like a familiar brand of wine - you know what to expect and it delivers sometimes with a newly found bouquet which might come from aging - either the wine or yourself. ,pos
 This is an incredible piece of drama and powerful which hits you. I found the film was great and getting to grips with the two main characters disability this was represented in a great performance by both two Michael and Rory. Whether the story is based around a true story I feel the story was trying to giving the audience a message that as a whole the general public should respect and feel for the needs of disabled people and that they should be given the same chance as any other human. On the whole this film reach into my soul and I too felt touched by the actors and the director sending out there creativity. The whole picture is that some actors take it beyond their character the play and only show part of the character that is believable to the audience but I feel that theses two certainly made great use as their gifted talent to portray a masterpiece piece of drama. Certainly one not to be missed! ,pos
 Canadian film-maker Ron Switzer delivers a solid non-stop thrill ride of relentless horror with the superb 1991 sci-fi film Science Crazed . A hideous monster takes revenge on his mother a police officer and tenants of an apartment building. Brilliant practical make-up and special effects designs create a truly terrifying monster especially when lurking through the atmospheric shadows and smoke of the gloomy apartment settings. The characters are developed beautifully with outstanding and surprisingly touching performances from an ensemble cast. Produced by Donna Switzer newcomer Ron Switzer also penned the film's face-paced script weaving together an engaging roller-coaster ride of twists turns and terror that keeps you guessing until the last frame. Science Crazed will no doubt leave you haunted long after the shocking conclusion. Highly recommended! ,pos
 What can i say about Tromeo and Juliet other than if you like twisted Troma machinations then you MUST see this movie! This is my absolute favorite Troma flick and i have seen almost all of them! Penis monsters cecsarian births to live rats and popcorn lesbianism steamy sex scenes in plexiglass boxes incest nipple piercing dismemberment shameless Troma plugs and computer masturbation...How can one go wrong? It amazingly follows the original story very closely. YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! OH and speaking of shameless plugs...Check out Jane Jensen's Comic Book Whore CD on Interscope records. It is awesome! ,pos
 Maybe it's unfair to dislike a movie for what it isn't rather than what it is but I approached this hoping that finally a filmmaker would make a movie about small-town rural gay men and women. Instead the focus is primarily on the outrageous bigotry (big news!) of the locals (and those in outlying areas) and the really gruesome torture/murder of a young gay man. So much time devoted to stupid people squawking about AIDS sin hellfire and perverts. So much time devoted to the ghoulish preacher ranting about the Bible and gay people getting what they deserve. I wanted to see more of the people that came to the small town gay bar not those who opposed it. In addition the young man who was murdered isn't even from this town. The whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration and it's very suspect. ,neg
 Cameron Diaz James Marsden Frank Langella: that's an all-star power cast but The Box proves once again that it is not a guarantee for a solid movie. The premise sounds promising: a couple gets a visit from a mysterious person who offers them a million dollar. The downside is that someone will die a person they probably will not know. So What Do You Do ? This gives us an interesting story for about 30 minutes. After that the story derails completely. Vague an uninspired plot lines about an alien conspiracy involving the NASA nothing really is explained here. The Box is a disappointment could have been so much better. But since it is based on an ultra short story that explains the continuity errors. ,neg
 i am in a vast minority here. i also didn't much care for the original caddyshack aside from the chase/murray duo scene and select rodney jokes. okay break it down: rodney vs. jackie- both jewish and have similar humor. rodney's a bigger name and more distinct. jackie has an incidental and more observational approach to his jokes and is more 'up yours' in this sequel. jackie's attitude toward everything is memorable and in a way inspirational! his quick lines and over-confidence left me wishing i could express myself in such a way. rodney was good but there wasn't enough of him and he was more 'in your face' and dismissive. jackie in a rare film appearance makes a perfect sub for rodney (come on a gun shaped hair dryer?!?!) really look at the little things! stack vs. knight- both play snobby yuppies very well. ted knight despite his wonderful tv/film career kinda shows his age. but he does pull off the snobbish demands of the part and we want to see him fall. ted looks kinda weak and is pretty annoying playing his anger and frustration too slapstick while stack is more incidentally snide and vengeful; you really hate him and enjoy see him constantly fail. stack wins with me. murray vs. aykroyd- well both had great vintage SNL-like scenes with the ever-present and enjoyable chevy chase (ty webb). i did like the murray/chase one better. murray plays his great annoying chatty character with obvious improv skill and is loveable- yet annoying. and the exact same can be said for aykroyd. both get annoying after a while but it's a tie. i really loved part 2 over the first. they are 2 totally different mooded films. part one is more drug/bathroom/sex humor with a cast full of great names. part 2 uses golf as a backdrop for a 'stick-it-to-the-rich' type of comedy that makes one feel better about being working class. 80s script? yes. a bit far-fetched? yes but wasn't the first? an insult to the sport of golf? yes it's a movie. thin story? yes it's a comedy with actual humor- not 'dances with wolves'!! besides- part 2 has a much better soundtrack!! PLEASE- DON'T EXPECT THIS TO BE A SEQUEL TO PART ONE!! IT IS 98% ITS OWN MOVIE AND SHOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THE NAME 'CADDYSHACK' IN IT. that said i am a big fan of caddyshack 2 and it is a great exponent of 80s fluff entertainment with quality humor. VIVA JACKIE MASON!!! to all the reducers- lighten up! it's a great comedy of its own. randy quaid was wonderful jonathan silverman was wonderful heck everyone was!! all this chatting and now i feel like watching it! i think i will ,pos
 The film begins with a dowdy housewife (Norma Shearer) finding out that her husband (Rod La Rocque) had been cheating on her. Three years pass and apparently they'd been divorced during these years due to the infidelity. Oddly during this time La Rocque did not see Shearer or his two kids as Shearer took them to Paris. Marie Dressler is a rich society lady and she has invited a new and improved Norma to come to her house for the weekend--ostensibly to help Marie break up a budding romance between her daughter and La Rocque! Apparently Norma is now a super-vamp and with her magical sex appeal she can break up the romance--and no one seems to realize that she and La Rocque were married. Several others are there for the weekend and immediately Norma is a hit with her gay carefree sexy ways--and almost all the men (including La Rocque) are captivated by her. Neither tells anyone that they were married but it's obvious that her ex- wants the new and improved Norma back! This film is a sophisticated comedy of manners among the upper-crust--similar in some ways to Jean Renoir's THE RULES OF THE GAME. Oddly despite the severity of the Depression such films about pretty rich folks were pretty popular though many today will doubtless find them a bit too droll in spots. However fortunately in LET US BE GAY there are plenty of cute and funny moments (particularly towards the end when Marie Dressler shows her true colors). While not a great film it certainly is a good one and more than just another time-passer. My only real regret is that I didn't love the very end. You'll just have to see it for yourself--perhaps you'll agree about the ending perhaps you won't but I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this clever film. ,pos
 After 15 minutes watching the movie I was asking myself what to do: leave the theater sleep or try to keep watching the movie to see if there was anything worth. I finally watched the movie: what a waste of time. Maybe I am not a 5 years old kid anymore! ,neg
 I have to be honest and admit that this movie did basically nothing for me except baffle me completely. It's burdened with a plot that revolves around the mysterious murders of several young women which then gets linked to the discovery of a body over 40 years old. The story never really seems to make much sense especially when Robicheaux (played by Tommy Lee Jones) starts having his conversations with Confederate General John Bell Hood (I never really did figure that out.) Jones was OK in his role although I thought he was really starting to show his age here. Horribly miscast was John Goodman as Julie Baby Feet Balboni who I guess is supposed to be some sort of local mob figure. I simply didn't think Goodman worked in this role although I'll admit that just could be because I'm not much of a John Goodman fan. Somewhere in the mix appeared Justina Machado as an FBI agent although I never really did understand what the FBI was involved in which could mean simply that my attention kept wandering from the screen. If it was explained though I missed it completely. Fortunately this is a fairly short movie so you won't waste too much of your life on it. 2/10 ,neg
 One of the most notorious of the banned Video Nasties of the 1980s is also one of the most excessively over-hyped. Make Them Die Slowly is about what you'd expect from an Umberto Lenzi-directed jungle potboilerinventive (yet poorly rendered) native torture techniques some ridiculous social commentary (yes even sillier than Cannibal Holocaust ) and lots of guts being chewed. The film's exploitative violence though is often only shown in brief close-up and never dwelt on for very long which diminishes its effect (interpret that how you may). The dialog is Lenzi's usual silliness as our male heroes show their affection for females by calling them tw@t and the like. The cast of familiar faces (including Lorraine De Selle Giovanni Lombardo Radice Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) does their best in the face of the escalating idiocy (including a completely ludicrous castration preservation ) but cannot save this overworked lousy effort. ,neg
 One commenter said if you like Austin Powers you will like this movie. I liked Autin Powers and was disappointed with this movie. The film works hard maybe too hard for laughs. Maybe it was that all the villains in this movie were shouting as if the shouting in itself is suppose to be funny. I get where they were trying to go with this flick. A cross between Zorro and the Scarlet Pimpernel but it just doesn't work. Austin Powers if silly but intelligent Zorro the Gay Blade lacks the savvy of Austin Powers The Big Lebowski or Kingpin. I kept waiting for a laugh and while waiting found myself amazed that someone actually got paid for the script. My 15 year daughter also thought the movie was flat. My 17 year old who selected this flick on it's title walked out after 20 minutes. It seems many people on IMDb liked this film but for me it lacked the good timing or jokes of a good comedy. ,neg
 There have been many people that have tried to make a movie that was identical to the story Heart of Darkness. Some movies have been based on Heart of Darkness like Apocalypse Now. In 1993 Nicholas Roeg directed a film that was exactly like the book. Heart of Darkness the movie is almost exactly identical to the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. Heart of Darkness is about the journey of a seaman named Marlow who sails along the Congo River to meet the super powerful ivory trader Mr. Kurz. Heart of Darkness the movie has the same exact beginning and setting as the book. It takes place on a boat in the Thames River and Marlow is telling the story to four other men on a boat called the Nellie. The whole movie is a flashback of Marlow's journey to see Mr. Kurtz on the Congo River. Marlow works for the Belgian Company which trades ivory along the Congo River. He tells of his account in the Company's office and about all of the maps he saw in the office. Marlow sets out on a steamer to Africa. He arrives at the Central Station where he receives orders from the general manager. The general manager tells Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and the ivory trading Marlow would be doing. Marlow soon finds out that the general manager is not fond of Kurtz because he fears Kurtz will replace him. Marlow waits around at the Central Station for months because his ship has been wrecked and it is getting repaired. Marlow sees the harsh treatment and enslavement in Africa while at the Central Station. When the ship has finally been repaired Marlow another African character named Mfumu and other crew members set sail on Marlow's steamer for Mr. Kurtz. Along the Congo River they are attacked by African natives in the wilderness. As Marlow's crew is attacked by the African natives they end up shooting and killing Mfumu. When Marlow finally arrives at Kurtz's station he meets a Russian who explains the might and glory of Kurtz. Marlow is then led to Kurtz's station home. There he sees many maps and pictures that Kurtz has painted. Finally Kurtz enters the room and begins to tell Marlow about all he has done in Africa and talks about his mistress. Marlow soon finds out that Kurtz is insane with power because the Africans hail him as a god. Marlow becomes angry with the harshness and enslavement that he sees in Africa. After Marlow finally meets Kurtz Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz was on his deathbed he called Marlow into his room. Kurtz's life begins to flash before his eyes and his last words were The horror the horror. When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's fiancé Marlow tells her that Kurtz's last words were her name to hide the darkness in Kurtz's life. Heart of Darkness was directed well and was formed into an adventurous movie. I recommend anyone to watch this movie because it is full of action and mystery. The movie is slow at times but in all it really interesting. Heart of Darkness will really broaden your mind and will teach you a lot about how to interpret different scenes. ,pos
 This film promises much but delivers little. The basic problem has to do with the inclusion of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character in this film. Immigrants from Sicily did not need a redheaded Anglo in any way--the movie may have needed her but new citizens certainly did not. In my opinion the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly troubling since it seems to demean not only the characters in the movie but also the history of immigration itself. Immigrants themselves were heroic figures fully capable of getting along without having to satisfied what I believer to be a veiled image of the white man's burden. I wonder if someone will make a movie of Irish immigrants which will include a Sicilian woman as a major character. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of film--acting production sets dialogue artistry film continuity plot and character development--on a scale from high of 10 for excellent 5 for average and 1 for needs help. Both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. The continuity as discussed above is further degraded by the surrealistic ending. Does not a film of such important historical significance deserve more than a conclusion which reminds one of Marc Chagall? The plot is simple enough until it seems to become entangled with too much time in the old country too little time on the ship and too much emphasis on the ending. The acting and character development is average since all the characters are fixed throughout the film and the inclusion of the Anglo-Saxon speaking perfect English almost turns the movie into a satire. Where's Groucho when you need him? The production sets the dialogue and the artistry are very good each rating a 10. The sets in Sicily on the ship and on Ellis Island are as good as one can find. The dialogue is marvelous and the ethic singing is superb. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Note that the immigrants speak of America not the United States --the ideal vs. the political reality. The are many good artistic scenes with dreams of America gold coins raining and giant veggies among the best. The average Left Elbow Index is 5.25 raised to a 7.0 when equated with the IMDb scale. One other notion seems to run through Ellis Island experience: the tribulations of pass immigrants was grueling later in 2006 one only had to pay a coyote or boat owner and sneak into the county under the darkness of night no questions asked! The movie is worth seeing but it appears that what one sees is problematical. ,pos
 I am surprised that there is confusion over the title of this film. Quite obviously it is an investigation into the nature of modern love. It is suggesting that love is love while the going is good but one in which people reserve the right to put themselves first and if the going gets tough they get out and go onto something else. This observation has generational implications as it is coming from Generation X makes comment on Generation X and in the end is aimed at Generation X. It expresses disappointment that love has transformed from that which the Baby Boomers the parents of Generation X had engendered in their marriages and family lives and which gave Generation X the innocent and bountiful childhood it ultimately enjoyed. The Generation X attitude to love is of course flippant but as decisions are made and commitments are broken the biggest casualty are the children of Generation X. This is made clear at the end of the film and was so pungent I took a week to recover from the shock I received from this epiphany. ,pos
 I watched this on tv in 1989 and regretted not taping it. I was very intriguing and suspenseful. It is amazing as the events unfold and this man's past catches up with him. The acting is first rate and the story is exactly what the title claims... twist of fate ... but no one could run away from a life that this man had at the beginning of the movie. ,pos
 With the Terrible acting the awful dialog the multitude of bad humor the crappy plot and over terrible film. This has to be the worst film i have ever viewed in my life and i'm the king of finding bad movies. For the effects they just threw fake blood on people and things didn't spend the time to create wounds and make special effects worth anything. Most people making low budget horror flicks at least do something like clads of tissue or something to make a gashing wound. The dialog was far from even decent and the acting was without direction or effort. They just threw some actors on a set and said have at it. I swear i've seen better films from my film I class at school. How did this ever get a DVD release? ,neg
 If you love the book as I do stop watching the video after Jean and Joe meet in Australia. Up to that point it is a fairly faithful rendition of the book and the visuals are great. 10 out of 10 to that point and I've enjoyed it many times. After that the story is seriously rearranged and revised in ways that really destroy the key part of the book i.e. how Jean creates a town like Alice (Springs). In the early part the major change is to make Strachan a 40-something bachelor instead of a seventy-year old widower. This rather skews this love story especially when there are also small changes that contribute to making him more selfish and avaricious such as: in the book he intimates to Joe at the ship that he might find more than a letter waiting for him in Australia but in the video he gives Joe no clue about Jean's whereabouts or intentions. The last hour of the 5-hour video scrunches and mangles the last third of the book. I see no reason why they threw in a fight between Joe and Jean -- it is quite out of character and seems to be just an Aussie dig at Pommies for telling them what to do. Then they bring on Strachan for the wedding (instead of some three years later) -- and have him read the toast!! -- very strange especially in the context of the relationship between Jean and Noel as cast in the video. The whole wedding scene is the invention of the screenwriters. These abominations take up time in the last hour which was already not long enough to do justice to the fascinating story of how Jean recreates Willstown as a place where she and Joe can both be happy. ,pos
 There was a time when not all animation was Disney or Pixar. Its so nice to see this wonderful film again and I actually got hold of a good reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful as its out of the public domain and there are some really bad copies around.I got a very good copy by a company called Flashbacks and its quite good. In the old days I watched it on black and white on TV and its magic to see it in colour. Very much better than some would have you believe. The songs are delightful and the colour is great. Interestingly the characters are really well developed which is odd in animated movies. I loved Hoppity and the villain Mr Beatle is a real cad. Its incredibly imaginative. The way inanimate objects like cotton reels old tins become part of the environment and have new functions is great. The anthropomorhic use of insects is amazing considering the much malinged creatures most people sadly think are repugnant. Hopefully we may never step on an insect again! THe insects enemy is man. In reality of course its the insects that will survive. No matter how hard we try to rid ourselves of ants here in Australia they keep coming back. The battle has been lost and we have to live with them. There are several scenes that stand out such as when Hoppity and Mr Bumble are caught in a watering can the great flood and the journey to the top of the building are all wonderful. Its also rather anthropomorphic but in a way thats charming. The human characters look very like the ones in Gulliver and its incredibly effective. The wedding scene looks beautiful. Its a crime this movie has not been hailed as a classic. The only jarring note for me is the occasions in the film when the characters slip into verse. Speaking verse spoils the narration and it was no needed The verse is awful and spoils an other wise good script. Its great and kids will love it. Its a joy to look at. There's a very clever ending too. ,pos
 A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing. Guy Rolfe so fantastic as Andre Toulon in part three barely features this time and Richard Band's fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film. For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some youth friends of his (many of the cast are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles - Teresa Hill is quite yummy). Totems minions of the Egyptian God Sutek want the secret of animation life back and the puppets (when they surface) act with a previously unseen cleverness to attempt to destroy the ugly and very computer game looking Totems. The Totems merely complicate the series and distract from the things that previously made the series so unique - they don't share the weird beauty of the puppets and thus don't really fit in. Top scene is Pinhead using a rag to clean blood from Tunnelers drill bit classic and about the goriest this film goes. The fifth film was filmed concurrently with this one so expect similar sections of mediocre and a Toulon performance that seems to have been filmed in a different era (or even galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserved better and series fans certainly do. Grrrrrrr. ,neg
 This film is on my top 20 comedies list. This is a truly unique film. To the reviewer who said I must be really missing something. --you are correct. You are missing something. If you don't have the kind of sense of humor this film requires that's one thing. But don't give it a bad review because you think it's looney but isn't intended to be. Loony is an apt description of both what it intends to be and what it succeeds in being. I laughed much more often and much more intensely at this film than I do at most other funny films. Michael Almereyda brought out the best in his cast in this his first big film for which he was nominated for an Independent Spirit award for Best First Feature. Crispin Glover as usual is absolutely brilliant in some perfectly inexplicable way and some of his very funniest lines ever were said in this film. Glover is clearly the best comic actor working right now. Harry Dean Stanton puts in an excellent comic performance. William Burroughs is incredible in a small role. Dylan McDermott was ideally cast and Lois Chiles is completely excellent. All of the above are perfectly funny in their own perfect way but this is one of Crispin's finest performances--up there with his performances in River's Edge and Willard. If you are a Crispin Glover fan but have somehow overlooked this film you need to stop whatever it is you're doing and see this immediately. But just remember to relax first and maybe have a beer or something. This is a great film but it is very unusual and I recommend being in or inducing an appropriately silly state of mind before viewing. ,pos
 Square pigs as a way of efficiently utilizing cargo space is the one and only clever moment in Space Truckers . Believe it or not Dennis Hopper has done worse see The American Way but this movie is way up there on the cream of the crap scale. I think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that Space Truckers will please no one. Too cartoon-like too be taken seriously an almost total lack of humor and poor character development virtually assures disappointment. The beer and popcorn crowd might tolerate one viewing but all others have been warned to avoid Space Truckers for all of the above reasons. - MERK ,neg
 Okay it features one lovely blink-and-you-miss-it-joke (when the dead are rising from their tombs the names of the old time horror directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are featured in the tombstones) and the smashing of morally bankrupt Repu/con/rightist villains is on-target: whorish skanks preaching morals etc. But why these soldiers are anti-Republicans? Because they have gone to the war most of them should be Republicans right? Why they don't go to killing the enemies who killed them or something? Why they ALL want to vote against the Republicans? Why this story has made of a movie? Questions never answered... ,neg
 I have to admit I picked this movie just for the cast and while Sutherland Scacchi and Prochnow were - as usual - great performers the rest of the movie was such a let down. It feels like it was put together by a team of adolescents with low level scripts that is scripts lacking any depth awful photography and editing and hilariously lousy score! I can't believe I was able to watch this seemingly long movie until the end... the sad thing is this could have actually been a great political thriller given the interesting plot. All the potential was there to make it a hit; that is two main ingredients are there: a great story of national conspiracies and a great core cast (even though many other actors are pretty much soap opera quality). But maybe I'm missing something; until then it's still not worth more than a 3 in my opinion. ,neg
 I have never seen a B movie like this one... on the part that the nanny Sofia is being killed... a hand of a woman appears on the tape handling the stick... how bad is that??? LOL I seriously laughed and wanted to stop seeing the movie but I kept watching it to see if this movie could get worse...LOL...it is bad for itself... poor Pinocchio.. the only nice bit is the first time you see some special effects of Pinocchio's face moving... apart from that the whole movie is awful... it's not really worth your time if you don't really have much to spare! But if you have nothing to do... go on... treat yourself with some Z movie cos B-movie is still too good for this one...LOL ,neg
 Most of this film was okay for a sequel of a sequel of a sequel... I was impressed by the amount of suspense there was; I HAD actually expecting that to be chucked out the window in favor of gore gore gore. It wasn't but there's some pretty ridiculous deaths. The thing that I disliked however was all of the plot complications. Those could have been okay if the scriptwriters had taken the time to explain all of them through. But what was the purpose of the secret society in the mental institution specifically? Why were they protected from Michael's damage until a certain point? What exactly were they going to do with the baby? How did Jaime Lloyd get pregnant for that matter? Why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant too? Why did Michael kill all his co-conspirators in the end? Why were there fetuses in the lab? The actors seemed to have figured it all out once they saw the fetuses.. But it was never explained to the audience. If you're just going to watch this film to see people get snuffed then this'll be okay for you.. However if you can't stand a plot being thrown at you which remains unresolved by the time the credits roll you should go watch something else. ,neg
 A year after her triumphant first special My Name Is Barbra Barbra Streisand regrouped with her production team to produce this follow-up CBS-TV special in then-revolutionary color. First broadcast in March 1966 Color Me Barbra follows a similar format to its predecessor - three segments the first two with unique concepts. The first takes place in the after-hours halls of the Philadelphia Museum of Art where dressed as a period maid she roams the galleries and becomes part of the artwork through song. In various guises Streisand expresses a variety of moods from the comedy schtick of the Minute Waltz to the melodrama of Non C'est Rien in a Modigliani painting to the beatnik-style frenzy of Gotta Move set to abstract art. My favorite moment in the special is when she transforms into a dead ringer of Queen Nefertiti while singing a haunting rendition of Rogers and Hart's Where or When . Opening with another comic monologue full of silly non-sequiturs this time in French the second segment is back in the studio for a brightly-colored circus medley where she interacts with animals including her beloved poodle Sadie. She finds an appropriate context for Sam You Made the Pants Too Long with a bevy of penguins and comically compares her profile to an anteater's with We Have So Much in Common . As with the first special the program ends with a riveting solo concert in which she sings some chestnuts Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home Where Am I Going? and Starting Here Starting Now among them. Also included is the brief introduction she filmed in 1986 ironically dressed in all-white when the special was first released on VHS. The juxtaposition of locale and song is even more effective than in her first special and a 23-year old Streisand is in peak form. ,pos
 This is a great TV miniseries of a classic novel. Janet McTeer and John Bowe in the lead roles are exceptional. This is one of the best adaptations from a book that I have seen. I would LOVE to get a copy of this - let me know if you know how I might get one...Thanks! ,pos
 Carmen is a prostitute that lives seducing and stealing soldiers of the Spanish army; she is without any doubt the best femme fatale at the moment. When a man resist her charming attentions she decides to do everything to destroy him. At the end he falls in her web and he will be forced to make all the things he ever hated only for being with Carmen. Despite Paz Vega is very beautiful she doesn't seem a gypsy (as Carmen is) and neither her acting nor Sbaraglia's are good. The story results very boring and in most moments it is very absurd while intending to appear truthful. in the same way are the scenarios and the Special Effects despite not being but they are not but acceptable and too much artificial for a historic film as it is. To sum up boring and bad with a very absurd development there are much betters thing to watch. ,neg
 this movie is about people living at a trailerpark. later in the movie it gets obvious that those people are out-of-work comedians mainly old males. well more or less they sit around the whole movie and talk about f***ing. but never there is any action just those people talking. in the beginning I thought it's some cool perverted redneck-stuff but after a while it got boring. I mean how many versions can you think of saying f***ing d**k & c**t? for sure this can be funny - for half an hour maybe not 80 minutes. but it was funny to watch those people trying to act. I'm pretty sure that they often were reading their text on some sheet when playing. but it does not disturb the movie it's cool like this. because those individuals seem so poor f***ed-up crestfallen a***oles that the style totally fits. their wooden helpless reading of the texts makes quite good atmosphere I fell in love with the characters a little. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** later in the movie the f***ers do some comedy-shows (rhymes about f***ing) with just themselves as audience and imagined applause. then one gets an eviction-advice and so they decide to defend the trailer park and enter their roofs - armed with some weapons. then they got shoot. fin. sounds like action but it's not. just some trashy home-camera takes. ***SPOILER END*** but the movie is totally consequent in it's style and I'm pretty sure it's just what the movie-maker wanted to have. it's the portrait of those f**k-ups in an groggy home-camera style with characters who can not act but seem interesting personalities so they are nice to watch. but the texts about - you know what - the whole time get boring after a while. pretty young director who also seems an interesting person as he played some teenager-stuff in popular movies/TV-series but now got in more horror-movies which is more his cup of tea I guess. and this his first direction-effort will be distributed by troma now. don't know anything about a release I got this one as an advance screener from this years cannes which says for bootlegging purposes only . ,neg
 Well the plot is entertaining but it is full of goof. To summarize things up cop/dad badly wants to save his son from cancer but the only way is by getting the transplant from the criminal(Michael Keaton). well criminal agrees BUT escaped in the hospital while the transplant was going on and the police and the cop-dad is not allowed to shoot at the criminal in order to save his son. (dead criminal-no transplant-dead son). well the police in this movie doesn't have a brain in case they never heard of a TAZER to knock off the criminal without killing him. end of movie as simple as that. But it when all crazy and stupid including the death of 2cops and a few doctor getting burned up pretty badly. ,neg
 This movie was a disappointment. The story is essentially The Shining with a castle (or a very cheap set masquerading as a castle to be specific) substituting as the hotel and a monster instead of the ghosts. The budget is the same you'd see from a Cinemax softcore porn as is the photography sets lighting and video it was shot on. The story is a failed attempt at sincerity: there's no easier way to make your audience feel sympathetic for your characters than to show them experiencing emotional trauma. And the trauma in this movie is pretty trite. Want an example? A blind girl listening to a language tape teaching the Italian words for colors begins to cry at what she will never see. This movie had a few things going for it however: the monster is actually pretty cool pretty scary-looking. And there is a pretty decent amount of nudity from Raffaella Offidani herself a star of Italian erotic films. The gore however leaves much to be desired as does the acting even from the experienced Jeffrey Combs. Other than this I've only seen two other Stuart Gordon films: Re-Animator and From Beyond both of which were outstanding. But I won't let this little footnote in his career keep me from watching many more of his movies. ,neg
 I remember being so excited on Saturday nights when I was a kid waiting for Dr. Who. I thought it was the best show ever made. Then I grew up Dr. Who went off the air and no one I knew had ever heard of it. Then I found out there was going to be a new series. I was a little nervous about it. Was it going to live up to the expectations I had carried around since I was little? Would they screw it up? Would the Dr. suck? Would his assistant suck? Would they create a more intimate relationship with the Dr. and his assistant? YES NO NO NO NO!!! This show is wonderful!! I love the new Dr. I love his assistant. I love the show. And I find myself excited on Friday nights now waiting for the new episode. I'm just now seeing 2005 episodes as I live in the States so I'm a little behind the rest of you. I hope the next Dr. is as great as this one! ,pos
 Up front if you're tired the first hour could be slow. The set up of the story has a natural leisurely pace unhurried - giving us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations the main characters are in. Once you arrived at the climatic segment of the storyline the turn of events will keep you hooked: how will things turn out what will happen to our precious Fanda (portrayed to utter quiet perfection by the veteran Czech actor Vlastimil Brodský) how will his wife (wonderfully played by Stella Zázvorková) treat him what happens to Fanda's dear friend Ed (played by Stanislav Zindulka - a matching sidekick to Brodský) and Jára the son with selfish hidden agenda blind to the kindness of his parents (sigh!) Vladimír Michálek sensibly directed the film with sprinkles of humor preserving the insightful script by Jirí Hubac. Thanks to clear subtitling I was able to notice for every 'complaining' phrase Fanda's wife utters there's a hint of 'caringness' showing/buried in between the lines - and so did the judicious lady judge observed. Fanda is '76 going on 80' and the affection of their enduring (endearing) marriage manifests even in their bantering arguments. His playfulness can be infectious. This is 'Growing Old Together 101' for (at least) the beyond fifties and lessons learned to sons and daughters not to take parents for granted. One may need to rethink if assuming 'home for the aged' is a means to an end so to speak. The film is gently shouting to us to live life to the fullest while we can. (Hint: there's joy in staying on and watch the end credits roll.) We're fortunate to be able to see an occasional Czech film. The Sverák ( Kolya ) father & son's 2001 Dark Blue World was revealing with pathos. It's good to take it slow now and then and appreciate a foreign gem - its subtitles scenery melodic score and an engaging human story with elegant performances. Autumn Spring (aka Babí Léto) is available on DVD. Enjoy! ,pos
 Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years back wanted to cast Dilip Kumar in the lead The film finally was re-written and made in 2003 and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at times Like the reason Amitabh-Hema separate is too superficial even the way the youth are shown is too bad like Gulshan in AVTAAR The message though comes well but things are presented in a clichéd manner Salman's character is the worst looks straight out of a storybook while the climax speech of Bachchan is good and also the final of not forgiving the sons is good Ravi Chopra does a good job Music is decent the songs sung by Bachchan stand out Amitabh excels like always he has played an elder stern father earlier but here he plays a victim and portrays it well His last speech is great Hema is good in her part Aman Verma stands out Samir Soni is okay Naseer and the rest sons and wives are decent though Divya Dutta stands out Salman Khan is fake Mahima is okay Paresh and Lillete are lovable ,neg
 Just before dawn is one of the best slasher films.It very realistic and atmospheric.It reminds me Tobe Hooper`s The Texas chainsaw massacre and Deliverance .Deborah Benson very good plays the heroine and director Jeff Lieberman created very creepy and dark movie. Just before dawn is beautiful photographed and soundtrack is very disturbing.I never liked slasher films or gore except with this one.Very impressive and convincing movie ( at least for me ) ,pos
 I love a film that mixes edge-of-the-seat suspense laughs style good acting and a bit of self-parody. Hitchcock consistently carried this off and in Le Cercle rouge Jean-Pierre Melville does the same. I was sorry when this long film ended. I agree with the English commenter who found remarks by one of my compatriots chauvinistic. I love French films Italian films English films Indian films--and the increasingly rare good American films. I also feel the writer who panned the film for being not even a good copy of an American gangster film missed the point completely. But I guess it's like jazz: either you get it or you don't so why waste time trying to explain. Just see Le Cercle noir and be prepared to be deliciously entertained. ,pos
 Set in the mid 1800's when the British is clearing New Zealand outback wilderness to establish colonies. The daughter of a British army surgeon Sarah(Samantha Morton) falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. The Maori is an indigenous tribe and a dangerous people for the Europeans to deal with. By the time Sarah's child which she calls Boy is born his father is dead. By the age of six Boy is kidnapped by his father's family and Sarah will begin her search for him with a man(Kiefer Sutherland) who is deeply in love with her. Two-time Oscar nominee Morton is definitely the star of this movie. Sutherland is a total waste. Also starring are: Cliff Curtis Stephen Rea Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Pene. This movie is rated R for some sexual content and violent battle scenes. I find the title RIVER QUEEN very misleading and the DVD cover with Sutherland only and making you believe he is the leading star should be a crime. ,neg
 Spike Milligan's books and plays have defeated film makers over the years and 2002's 'Puckoon' is sadly no exception. The novel set in 1924 concerns the partitioning of Ireland in particular its effects on a solitary community ( the 'Puckoon' of the title ). Due to a colossal blunder half the village is now in Northern Ireland the other half is in the Republic. Locals go to the toilets at the bottom of their gardens to find a barbed wire fence blocking their path. Drinkers crowd like sardines into a corner of the pub to enjoy a cheaper pint. A dead man has to have a passport made out in his name before villagers can reach the churchyard to bury him. 'Puckoon' is a sort of Irish 'Under Milk Wood' with comic characters and surreal happenings galore. The lead character Dan Milligan ( renamed 'Madigan' in the film ) is impishly played by Sean Hughes and has conversations with the narrator ( Richard Attenborough ). Also in the film is Milo O'Shea Griff Rhys Jones David Kelly ( from 'Robin's Nest' ) Freddie Jones Joe McGann and Elliott Gould. Interviewed for the 'Making of 'Puckoon' documentary writer/director Terence Ryan expressed undying admiration for the book. It shows on screen. But alas like the ill-fated film of 'The Hitch-Hiker's Guide To The Galaxy' a good book does not necessarily make a good film. The trouble with 'Puckoon' is that like Milligan's other books they simply do not work on the big screen. 'Puckoon' is essentially a collection of jokes in search of a plot. No way can the film be compared to train wrecks like 'Sex Lives Of The Potato Men' 'Fat Slags' and 'Lesbian Vampire Killers' but then neither is it as good as it should have been. The last half-hour involves a lot of running around by the police the British army some locals who have stashed explosives in a coffin and is really tedious to sit through. Ryan's decision to stick closely to the book is the main reason for its failure to work as a film. The other problem is the total absence of charm. 'Waking Ned' had this in spades while the 'Father Ted' television series was funnier by far. Spike lived long enough to see the film and apparently enjoyed it. His daughter Jane has a cameo as Madigan's bride. The highlight for me though was the quotation at the beginning: I don't mind dying! said Spike: I just don't want to be there when it happens! . ,pos
 I also attended the RI International Horror Film Festival and I can easily see why this film won best of show. SEA OF DUST is a wild romp of Horror Comedy and beautiful scenery. A back in time tale of strange goings on. An increasingly wide spread illness with an overwhelmingly irritating side effect of people's heads exploding brings a young Professor's apprentice; Stefan to investigate. Along his travels he decides to briefly detour and once again ask for his long time love's hand in marriage only to once again be sent packing by her extremely stubborn father Along the way out of town he comes across an ill girl in the road and delivers her to Dr. Maitland (brilliantly played by up and coming Vincent Price like actor: Edward X Young.) Who fills Stefan in on the Evils a foot. Only the Dr. is insulted that he had called for the Professor and only received a boy in trainingNone the less Stefan turns out to be much more than a common bystander. Horror Icon; Tom Savini portrays the ultimate religious torment monger; Prester John. Scream Queen; Ingrid Pitt comes out of retirement to give a stellar performance as Anna. Many beautiful and talented supporting actors seamlessly held the story together and helped to effectively move it along to the climax. Dark Religion and over the top but fun and sometimes very original gore scenes play heavily in this Hammer tribute flick. This stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks surreal worlds dreams and the character's reality. Horror and Gore aside; This is also a very Funny movie! Slapstick tongue and cheek humor and dark comedy raise their heads among the dark story line. Like others have stated; this really is like three great movies in one. Very Entertaining and Original. ,pos
 Tobe Hooper (fresh off mainstream success with 'Poltergeist') aims for the skies this time around. 'Lifeforce' is an adaptation of Colin Wilson's 'The Space Vampires'. The script by 'Alien's Dan O' Bannon and Don Jakoby) varies a bit I was told: the futuristic storyline was made contemporary and Hailey's Comet was added to coincide with its actual passage by Earth a few weeks after the films release (so I've read). The story concerns a shuttle mission (commander by Steve Railsback) sent to investigate Hailey's Comet as it passes by Earth. All goes off without a hitch but upon reaching the comet it is discovered that an alien ship is hidden in the coma of the comet. The team investigates the massive structure and discovers desiccated bat-like creatures. Looking deeper into the ship a chamber is found that contains three humanoids (two naked males and one rather fetching nude lady too) in odd stasis coffins. The crew returns to the ship with the humanoids and a bat creature in tow. A bit later the ship returns to Earth but no contact can be made by NASA and another shuttle is launched to ascertain the status of the mission. Upon docking with the Churchill it is discovered that a massive fire has seemingly killed the crew and all data concerning the flight. But the three humanoids remain. However it is learned that an escape pod had been launched but whose whereabouts are unknown. Soon they make the discovery of the alien's origin when the very attractive space vampire queen arises from her slumber to easily seduce the lifeforce from the men around her. If you suck face with her she makes you like them and if you don't feed after two hours you will dry out and become dust. The goal of the three is to drain enough of the population's essence to power and sustain them and their ship for the trip to the next planet to lay waste to them as well. Thankfully the Commander survives re-entry in the pod (crash lands in Texas no less) and now has a psychic link to her royal hotness the queen and is able to use it to find the hidden queen as she and the surviving male attempt to bleed London dry of their souls. Tobe Hooper (of 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' (1974)) does an admirable job in what has to be his largest production to date. The production assembled many fine technicians from all over the movie industry. Production Designer John Graysmark (fresh off 'The Bounty (1984)') uses every bit of four stages at Elsree Studios to create the spacious interiors of the ship and such. Cinematographer Alan Hume returns to science fiction after a stint on 'Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi' (1983) and three consecutive James Bond episodes. Hume uses every bit of the widescreen frame with the great effects. Oscar winner John Dykstra innovator of the groundbreaking effects of the original 'Star Wars' (1977) manages to push the envelope once again a creating some highly creative and spectacular effects using lasers. Heck even maestro Henry Mancini drops in to give the film a very memorable title theme that gives this sci-fi / horror hybrid a touch of an adventurous feel. In the acting department it pretty much falls onto the shoulders of Steve Railsback and newcomer Mathilda May (vampire queen). Railsback always brings an edge to the characters he plays and can play nuts like nobody's business. That comes in hand as his mind deteriorates when the queen's grip tightens on his soul. Gorgeous French actress May doesn't have a heck of a lot of lines (were there more than ten?) but her frequently nude presence never gets old and you gotta give her kudos to having the jingle bells to pull it of. Pretty much all the queen is there to do is feed and to do so she needs to seduce you with her sexual presence. Job accomplished and where do I sign up to be victim? I really enjoyed how they tweaked the old vampire clichés and still managed to make it seem fresh but still easily recognizable. Almost everything is accounted for here: bats (their true form resembles a large bat) coffins {the stasis fields resemble these) transformations (they scan your mind and can be anything) massive sexual appeal (Miss May.duh) not to mention they even include the old standby stake-through-the-heart (this time a bit of a lead dagger to the energy center slightly below the heart). The only thing they didn't touch on was religion but I think that the vampires using the cathedral at the end as home base might just be a bit of a wink and a nod. In short (yeah right 800 words later) 'Lifeforce' is an excellent science fiction and horror combination that pays homage to the vampire theme while adding some neat different wrinkles. The effects and scale of the production are enough to keep summer movie types engaged (at least at the time) and horror and sci-fi fans engaged. 4 of 5. ,pos
 Thank god for this movie. It's a document of talent that three decades later seems even more unique and rare in retrospect. The music is just extraordinary packed with so much talent in writing performance arrangement and production that it's absolutely infectious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances by under-appreciated talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods uplift my spirit every time I hear them. While the film may be different from the stage version I prefer the soundtrack to the cast album which I find truly grating and under-developed. Here the arrangements are filled out and expanded into dynamic pieces that couldn't have been produced in a stage setting. But the music isn't the only thing extraordinary about this movie. The juxtaposition of almost hyper-realist dialog scenes (reminds me of Altman films) intercut with exuberant musical and dance numbers really works. All the talent in this movie--directing writing photography editing music choreography casting acting costuming art direction--merge perfectly into one of the best musical films I've seen. I think it's amazing how much we know about the characters in Hair based on very little information or plot. They're not drawn as caricatures but as realistic and very human people. We see little glimpses of where they come from but the portrait is completed by vignettes that draw the characters to the surface through accomplished acting directing and editing. There's an undercurrent theme of the misogyny of Berger and Hud which colors their characters by exposing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. The scene of Berger's home life reveals important details about his psychology and the brief glimpse of Claude's home tells us volumes about his background through the simple realistic and genuine interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father. I love the fashion in this movie. It defiantly mixes sixties ideas with VERY seventies looks (one does have to overlook Treat Williams' hair extensions...). It's a document of how chic much of the late-seventies was contrary to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste. Claude's beige knitted tie was a hot trend of 1979 and the hair and clothing of the singers and dancers (particularly those in white during the Central Park scene) mixes up the decades in a way that suggests the timelessness of the musical's themes. These elements merge with Twyla Tharpe's extraordinary state-of-the-art choreography in a way that enhances the artistry of both. Hair isn't a film that rewards cynicism. If you come to it with expectations then you're most likely going to be held captive by artists who aren't bound by your rules. For me it opened my eyes and ears and spirit to an insightful and passionate musical dialog about war friendship and family that transcends its time and is still meaningful and relevant to me to this day. ,pos
 This piece of garbage belongs in the basement of some moldy old mansion where it will never see the light of day again. The only thing scary about this junk was the price of admission. I was only amused when the ending credits started rolling and I was free to vacate the auditorium. What an unmitigated bore; a complete waste of 1 and a half hours. When I die I pray I can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the moron who penned this gibberish. ,neg
 Latter days is the best gay movie of the homosexual genre. Most of the films entail sappy stories one night stands and let us not forget infamous baseball teams? Latter days actually contains male affection beyond the kiss in the dark and quite graphic material that made me wonder whether the film belonged at Blockbuster or badpuppy.com. The films emotional journey is what sets it above the rest in the genre. Not until this film had I seen a story of such intense passion and love and the torture that it can bring. I think when people cry during movies they should be beaten but I found myself sobbing throughout several scenes because of the realistic nature of the world in which we live. I suggest every gay male see this film and if you have a boyfriend thank him... ,pos
 Most of the criticism of Attack of Show is from people who are unfairly comparing it to an old computer TV program called The Screen Savers. People are upset because G4 decided to cancel the Screen Savers and replace it with the pop culture based Attack of the Show. To compare the two shows is like comparing apples to oranges! Attack of the Show is a unique hour long program that covers current Generation X/Y culture. It features segments on movies/television panel discussions video games new DVD releases sex advice new gadgets (MP3 players cell phones etc) comic books/graphic novels magazines and internet fads. It's a fun show definitely worth checking out you are in your 20s or 30s. I give it an 8 out of 10. ,pos
 Fantastically written acted and produced! Loved seeing this gleaming talented cast -- every single one of them -- give a such great performance. This movie thoroughly warmed the cockles of my heart! Great storytelling! This is a great movie for Black History month. Full of an accurate portrayal of recent history and very real characters who weathered incredible pain -- with dignity and a belief in a better future. It is so easy to see how these diverse adults all affected this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually fuel the talent of his adulthood. The next time you're in the company of a listening and observing child remember; show or he may be a writer-in-the-making! ,pos
 First of all nothing will ever compare to the original movie but for gosh sakes they're not trying to. It is just one persons opinion about what could have happened after Rhett left Scarlett at Tara. I for one thought it was a terrific movie and would like to add it to my GWTW collection. The scenery alone would make me want to watch the movie. Just view this movie as an extension of the original and don't think they are trying to replace Vivian Leigh and Clark Cable and you will enjoy it a lot. They really captured the spoiled selfishness of Scarlett in many of the scenes and you can see from the longing in the looks from Rhett that he is clearly still in love with Scarlett. The fact that you can recognize many of the actors in the movie is another plus even though some of them have only been seen on TV. I always wanted them to have other children after Bonnie Blue died in the movie and this satisfied my need perfectly. Lore60 ,pos
 It doesn't surprise me that the makers of this hopeless movie couldn't find a UK distributor and then had to release it as a free DVD with a Sunday newspaper. The distributors could clearly see what the film-makers and the Sunday newspaper couldn't that this was one movie that just wasn't going to recoup its costs. Since it's a thriller about riddles it would have helped if they'd picked a lead actor who could enunciate properly rather than the mumbling Vinnie Jones who appears to pronounce riddle as riell . And it would have helped if the dialogue hadn't been swamped by noisy locations or scenes flooded with distracting and inappropriate music. The plot is ludicrous: The lost Charles Dickens story supposedly helps our hero solve a series of modern murders but so would a copy of Herge's Adventures Of Tintin since the link between Dickens and Jones is more non-existent than tenuous. And we have the ridiculous premise that a would-be investigative journalist who lays his hands on a previously undiscovered Dickens manuscript would take several days to read it just so that flashbacks to Dickens can continue to be played throughout the movie as if they had some connection to it. Which they don't. I mean if you found a new Dickens manuscript wouldn't you just go somewhere quiet and read it ? The film ends with one of those surprise revelations that have become mandatory since The Sixth Sense but in this case it doesn't so much surprise you as insult your intelligence. If the film is suddenly going to turn supernatural at the twelfth hour then revealing that Vinnie Jones is a robot might have been more acceptable. It might not have seemed so turgid if the film had been stylish but it isn't. And in several places it appears decidedly amateur: There's a scene where a table is laid with a 60's jump-cut technique but they haven't made sure that the person actually laying the table is completely out of frame between the cuts. Consequently you can see things changing at the edge of frame when you're really supposed to be watching things changing at the centre of frame. A good rule in movie-making is: If you don't understand how to do a technique then try something else. The real riddle is why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie in the first place. ,neg
 -may contain spoilers- Clearly who ever made this film must have had a lot of connections. I just can't see it any other way. What really surprises me is no one used the name Allen Smithee and more surprising everyone involved didn't use this name. Anyhow where to begin. The bad dialogue the crummy costumes the sorry looking film stock the unintentional comedy the over-the-top characters and more inconsistencies than George W. Bush's college career. I don't know what was funnier the guy losing his arm because of a snowball or the slow motion scene where all the baby Jack Frosts' were getting killed. Also one of the great lines of all time was uttered in this film. How do we know it's him? Like there's another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! A great camp film but a very bad film overall. ,neg
 I love camp movies believe me and the usual technicolorian gore of Gordon Lewis don't bother me at all but this is just one of his most stupid movies even more than BLOOD FEAST i'm not kidding. THE GORE GORE GIRLS is about a mad person who kills a lot of go(re) - go(re) girls of a night club. A detective and a reporter tries to find out the big secret. Maybe the performances here are slightly better than the usual average acting H.G Lewis films but that is not saying much. The camera work is even dreadful. But at least is kind of watchable with the go go girls acting ... you going to pass a good time with it and the killings are just absurd in a very very bad way: A girl is killed with a wooden hammer punching in her butt (!) and just don't let me talk about what it does with the nipples. You going to laugh like anyone with this. But the better of all this mess is a scene that i only love of it's campness: the go-go girl before being attacked by a lot of feminists dancing in a very American way. Though is important to note that this was one of the first films that got an X rating because of it's violence. ONLY if you want lo laugh and pass a good time (But only with a lot A LOT of beers). ,neg
 Silly and violent thriller that is a rip - off of 'Deliverance' but without any charm and intelligence. The plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to be free of this obnoxious entry. This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way. It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this. ,neg
 This movie didn't do it for me an avid SNL fan for the past 14 years. Jamie Gertz' portrayal was OK but there was something so off-putting about the movie itself. The facts presented in the movie are totally skewed. But Merv Griffin produced it so that would explain a lot. He was never on SNL nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are backwards. When we first see her on SNL walking through the studio with Lorne Michaels the logo on the wall is circa 1988-1989 not 1975. And let's talk about the cast -- who are these people?? I have never heard of a one of them. Truly dissatisfying. This movie shows why TV movies are just that TV movies. ,neg
 I viewed the original Outer Limits in real time when first broadcast and have since viewed the entire original series again and again in re-runs and complete on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested. With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series. Plots are intelligent scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future. While most producers and directors in Hollywood ignorantly view Sci-Fi as indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy this series returns to the origins of Science Fiction in the logical moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations. This series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the shoot-em-up video game monster mentally of much of the current generation. It has brains history a message and good entertainment. It is an adult series without unbearable teenage know-it-all fantasies. Hurray! Now if we can only get MGM to release the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD instead of just the six poor teaser discs and the 1st season now only available. ,pos
 Keep away from this one. The worst thing is the appalling story. There seems to be an intent to convey some subtle spiritual/love/friendship message but it is so pathetically devoid of any substance you can't help but cringe. In addition the majority of screen time is a far below standard story of thieves criminals and our hero(es) dealing with some alien time travel artifacts. I know you are asking for trouble when dealing with time but the story is more full of holes than usual. Also you have: cheap sets bad acting and some of the worst music arrangements in the history of the moving picture overpowering cheap abrupt and disjointed. All I can say is Man alive ! This film is bad !  ,neg
 The best part in this movie is the first one located in Sicily I suppose. Crialese shows a good talent for photography and the movie start is delightfully surprising. The rest of the story is quite boring. Crialese uselessly insists on stereotypical situations and characters trying to melt neorealistic suggestions and video-music technique Fellinian surrealistic remembrances and a very annoying and completely off-topic soundtrack leading the whole thing towards an end which gives you the sensation of an exaggeratedly long story cut abruptly short. Frankly this is a real overrated movie and Crialese is a real overrated director. ,neg
 Completely agree with other review. I watched this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked up the one review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel. This was after I slowly backed away from the TV with remote in hand jaw dropping lower and lower. The quality of the filming is beyond low budget. It doesn't even look like a freaking movie. If I were watching 'home video' footage from a documentary I would expect it. In summary: Avoid avoid avoid. Boooo Lion's Gate! Completely ashamed of myself for watching 5 minutes and I hope that I've saved others from renting or owning it. ,neg
 I have this movie on a collection of inexpensive B-movies. It's not restored in fact the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutes. At first it seemed like a typical haunted house film and feels very much like the forerunner of Clue Murder by Death House on Haunted Hill etc. About a half hour into the film the storyline takes a really interesting twist--and it goes from being a cliché melodrama to something entirely different and far more entertaining than I had initially thought. Check it out it's a great deal of fun even if the long clips and wider shots (and near lack of music score) make it feel a bit creaky by today's standards. ,pos
 I would hate to have anyone watch this inspired by a true story movie and draw any conclusions about the true event. Few things they did get right were overshadowed by the things that were just not true. Ed Gein never dragged anyone behind a car never met up with anyone at the graveyard and killed them no proof he returned body parts to the graveyard. The things he did were awful enough why try to make it worse? This movie ranks among my 10 worst wastes of eye strain. In the Light of the Moon is a much better film on the subject it is more factual and the acting is superior in contrast to this one. ,neg
 ok i am really into King's stuff but this is just dreadful. the whole movie i am waiting for the main character to do something profound with his new youth and power. i can tolerate the worst of movies as anything is better than watching a cut movie with commercials in it. but this takes the cake. i gave it a 2 and i would never recommend it to anyone. ,neg
 This movie was a complete disaster for me. There is one thing that movies must have in order to be watchable and that is *some* psychological credibility of characters... unfortunately here this is not the case. The main characters behave irrationally most of the time and even if they have some reason for such behavior it is not revealed to us by the director. Sophie Marceau's character is particularly irritating making pictures of everything throughout the whole movie when one could expect something more rational (for example meeting with her mother in the hospital)... and why exactly did she marry this guy? (no this is not a spoiler) The plot at times seems like ripped off some soap-opera and while the actors' performance is not bad this does not help much. All in all I just could not find a way to connect with this movie. Not that I tried too much after the first hour though. I have never walked out of cinema during a movie but this time was the closest in my life so far. ,neg
 This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I'd be able to stand it. But I was wrong. First the weird looping? It was like watching America's Funniest Home Videos . The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it. Now the final scene transcends I must say. It's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. What crappy dancing. Horrible and beautiful at once. ,neg

 Kind of a guilty indulgence nowadays this used to be required watching when i was in high school. It really is a great illumination of the burgeoning punk scene in LA in 1980. As the bands play Spheeris prints the lyrics in subtitles which is of course necessary if one really wants to know what the guy is screaming into the microphone. But also it turns the camera's POV into that of tourist passing through this alien world. The band interviews reveal an honest approach to the music that really doesn't exist anymore. Then again it's not as easy to come by $16/month former-church closets like Chavez of Black Flag does. How many unheard of bands do you know that aren't trying like the dickens to get a record deal? These guys just didn't care. And who can't love the commentary of the little French dude who used to be the singer for Catholic Discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His gritty voice delivers one of the best soliloquies ever captured on film: I have excellent news for the world ... there's no such thing as New Wave. Whew! What a relief! ,pos
 German emigree and uber-hambone actor Paul Muni who never saw a scene he didn't want to chew up goes blackface to play a humble Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles and working his way up in the world. If this creaky vehicle reminds anyone of Al Pacino's minstrel performance as an uncultured Cuban in the remake of SCARFACE don't be too surprised. The characters are quite similar and both get wildly pop-eyed when the script calls for it. Hispanics everywhere should be greatly offended by Muni's over-the-top performance as this giddy Mexican living the American dream consequences be damned. I guess Benicio DelToro's grandfather wasn't available. A young bleached-blonde Bette Davis plays one of Muni's love interests; she eventually goes insane for love of Mr. Meh-hee-can Muni. An absolute hoot Davis is the sole reason to watch this racially offensive claptrap. There is an absolutely delirious near the end when Muni asks the gal of his dreams to marry him -- a white gal of breeding with one of those stilted stage-like '30s accents that Hollywood loved so much -- and she calls him a savage and a brute of a different tribe. Muni immediately transforms into Mr. Hyde and chases her to an untimely death. In the final scene a repentant Muni tells his sober-faced priest that he is going back to his own people his own kind. End of movie. Finis. That's all she wrote. Muni was said to have hired a gen-oo-ine Mexican as a chauffeur in order to study this exotic creature's speech pattern and physical habits. Yowza! ,neg
 Robert McKimson's 'Acrobatty Bunny' is one of the director's finest shorts. Although the circus-based setting may evoke hideous memories of McKimson's dreadful 'Big Top Bunny' 'Acrobatty Bunny' is in fact nowhere near as dull as that travesty. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a ferocious lion 'Acrobatty Bunny' is fresh and funny from the outset not to mention extremely attractive to look at. There's a classic scene in which Bugs takes a strangled elevator ride out of his hole only to emerge directly into the jaws of the lion. In a brilliant Disney parody he hollers Pinocchio down the lion's throat! This brilliant opening is a sign of things to come. There are some expertly choreographed antics in and around the lion's cage to begin with followed by a hilariously grotesque and irritating rendition of 'Laugh Clown Laugh' which as a child I used to impersonate regularly! All this culminates in a short acrobatic sequence which gives the cartoon its name. I've never been fond of the circus as a setting for cartoons and find it usually makes for a dull and predictable set of gags but 'Acrobatty Bunny' breaks from the mould and the result is an exhilaratingly funny short which stands amongst McKimson's best. ,pos
 Without doubt one of the worst films ever made. Sluggish and without structure tension or story the film coasts on the thin premise of putting together a show . Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their inception and dialogue is random and incidental. Everything is put together in a slapdash order and often Stepping Out feels more like a deleted scenes reel than an actual movie. The film seems to exist merely as a showcase for gaudy and totally random Liza musical numbers. Shelly Winters can be seen in the far superior octo-epic Tentacles and the REAL Liza can be found in the Showtime release of Queer Duck: The Movie . ,neg
 There are about ten minutes about half way through Strangeland when one suddenly sees the glimmer of an interesting idea. Themes of revenge and rehabilitation come into focus during Robert Englund's brief screen time. Sadly Strangeland then resumes its course as a thoroughly predictable and boring slasher film. ,neg
 Ramsay  the kings of comedy (or was it horror whatever) wake after years of hibernation. And yes I did get scared. No not because of the horror element (of course I am not that squeamish) but because rats were constantly dancing on my feet in the khatmal-chaap theatre (where else do such movies run). So check the plot. A man is repeatedly stabbed choked to death stuffed in plastic and dumped in a pool. But he still returns to take revenge. Now was the film a thriller or a horror? That itself is the suspense for you to discover. And the end turns out to be another mask mystery. Remember those trademark Ramsay undercover agents  men wearing some stupid horror masks. Only here the mask is of a human. I suppose no more detailing is required to skip this flick. Amarr Upadhyay tends to get over-dramatic and theatrical forgetting the difference between cinema and TV soaps. A cheaply and skimpily dressed Aditi Gowitrikar in her typical pink lipstick looks like .. (Uh! you know what). The background score is a straight lift from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Not a single department of the film whether technical or creative is worth commenting. Novelty lacks both in story and execution. Dhund certainly fogs your senses. ,neg
 Just ingenious enough to be plausible and still a lot of fun this is a pure slice of the 1970s (Even the cops need haircuts badly!). Shot in and around London the plot of the American ex-con who tries going straight but finds himself sent as an electrician to a bank in Mayfair and then has the screws put on by crime lord David Niven and finds himself plotting the crime of the century is well-handled. I liked its simplicity and even innocence it harks back to a time when caper films where just that a caper and violence wasn't a part of the deal. All in all you could do a lot worse than watch this: it has enough twists and turns to give it some oomph and a cast that obviously had fun making it. Nicely made and watchable. ,pos
 Is there anything else on earth to be more enticing than to learn what expects our frail bodies after um death. Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (a soul-mate of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) provides blow-by-blow answer to our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey in the world of preparation tables scalpels surgical saws human entrails and warped minds. Welcome to the autopsy room! I don't know which facets of the film apart of its notorious reputation may have helped it to acquire sufficiently high rating. Storywise it's fairly simple and straightforward - a day in the life (actually half an hour) of a troubled coroner (or perhaps assistant pathologist or whoever he is) that is fed up with his routine morbid duty and discharges his psychological tension in a non-traditional fashion right at his workplace. I'm perplexed of what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this one-note plot. I suspect it may be somehow inspired by Udo Kier's character's quirky demeanor in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. Artistic values of the film are also questionable. It's hard to evaluate the performance of the actors that don't squeeze a single word. Their emotions are concealed behind the medical masks. There's also not enough room for great camera-work - basically the entire action unfolds mostly within four walls. Authenticity - effects and makeup are impressive and the setup looks very plausible but only a handful of medical/forensic experts can judge how truthful and anatomically correct the dissection is carried out here (if anyone cares). Honestly I used to think that the autopsy is done to examine the condition of particular organs and to ascertain the cause of death. Now I know that dead bodies are severed raped and humiliated intestines are ripped apart brains are retrieved from the head stuffed into abdomen and mixed with guts then the body is stitched back and washed - nothing personal. And what are these poor lads expected to write in their deceitful autopsy reports afterward? Shock and disgust factor - it's much unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer would discover to his horror that the disc he was intended to watch with his wife and kids beside a Christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual on vivisection. This obscure item is barely available sought by people well familiar with the subject and not easily offended. Hence it would be pointless to warn anyone to sabotage this film. They are well aware what exactly they are watching and what they want to see. Cerdà is really gifted and stylish director which is clearly obvious from at least two other parts of his trilogy - preceding 'The Awakening' amazing black and white short and 30-minute 'Genesis' visually stunning and moody piece with an off-beat and interesting concept. And I'm pretty sure that one day he will conquer the hearts of moviegoers with his new more mainstream oriented material. And sooner or later 'Aftermath' would become a rarity for the meticulous collectors of his early warm-up works. But in the meantime I'm afraid it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists that study mental disorders and sexual deviations. ,neg
 Brian (Wesley Eure) works for a security firm owned by Mr. Norton (Conrad Bain). The Norton firm is in financial trouble for unknown to the owner he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival firm's owner (Jim Bacchus). It's not Brian as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good inventor. But Mr. Norton has no patience with Brian in part because Norton's beautiful daughter Casey (Valerie Bertinelli) has a thing for Brian and Norton questions Brian's motives for wooing her. However Brian does come up with a great security device. It's called CHOMPS which stands for canine home security system. The device which looks like a dog is actually a computer controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and emit siren sounds to capture burglars. The rival owner sends two bungling spies (one is Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS save Norton security? This is a fun family flick from the old school of good clean entertainment. CHOMPS is of course a real dog played by the adorable and talented Benji. In fact Benji has a duel role as Brian has a real dog named Rascal too. Just watching this little dog in action is pure joy as he is able to scale walls pull trucks and operate machine buttons to capture the bad guys. The human cast is also quite nice with everyone giving upbeat performances that are infectious. Costumes scenery and production values are good too. Although you may have trouble locating the film it would be well worth the effort to secure a view for your closest loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful wholesome diversion from the world's woes. ,pos
 What a nasty cynical film. Apparently this sad excuse for a dramatic urban look at what 20 year olds do whilst crawling through the gutter of Sydney nightlife is supposed to be somehow connecting with its target market. Made by some Industry nobody and pals who seemingly thought they could cobble together any sleazy behavior with a young cast and pour it into multiplexes SAMPLE PEOPLE deservedly failed miserably at the Australian box office. It is so offensive in its clichéd depictions of obvious and easy targets it was fully rejected by the very audience it was intended. Shoddy and cruel and with no attempt to offer quality or resonance to the young audience who might have been attracted by the marketing or casting SAMPLE PEOPLE might have been interesting or even informative if not botched by its exploitive view of 'what teens want to see in a movie'. The character played by Ben Mendelsohn is particularly offensive and Kylie Minogue is again wasted by poor material and untalented film makers. It is as if the producers thought teens would watch any ugly trash and just slung-together scenes and characters who were shallow and soul less. Well the were very wrong. A mini budget film made in 1983 called GOING DOWN got this topic right and is an excellent antidote to this poison. ,neg
 Superb silent version of the story of Francois Villon. Although remade in the thirties as IF I WERE KING with Frank Lloyd directing Preston Sturges scripting and Ronald Colman starring this version is even better. Barrymore with a cohort of comedians plays the comic fool and the wine-depressed Villon with a verve that Colman could not match. The photography is startling in its beauty and innovation and the supporting cast particularly Conrad Veidt in his American premiere the incredibly beautiful Marceline Day and the supporting comics Slim Summerville and Hank Mann steal every scene they are in. It is a shame that Barrymore did so few first-rate comedies. Among his sound films only his lead in TWENTIETH CENTURY and his supporting role in MIDNIGHT can compare to this and those stand up only because of his superb voice. In this silent movie Barrymore must tell his tale without benefit of words and he does so alternately hilariously unrecognizable as the King of the Fools and tenderly as Villon in love. He even gets to leap around in the swashbuckling style of Fairbanks most convincingly. He also lets his supporting cast have their share of glory capering in this ensemble work like any talented comic of the era. Finally a brief word about Alan Crosland a director known today only for directing the first talking feature THE JAZZ SINGER in the same year this was released. Crosland was a careful innovative delightfully original director and it is a shame that more of his works are not known. Perhaps this movie far more interesting as a movie than his best-known work will be your introduction to his other talents. If so you could do far worse. ,pos
 this movie makes me laugh by even just thinking about it. such a smart comedy! very precise yet easy. the casting can not be any better. all actors are the best choice of their roles and they all play precisely the best and there is no stupid laughs or shouting through out the whole movie. layers and the progress of story work perfectly together and the rhythm flow smoothly. the greatest of all is when the Village People's YMCA is cued in it brings out the importance of the Indian's statute which was only briefly brought up previously in the movie which makes the smartest and funniest climax among many comedies. I give it a ten especially a lot of times comedies are so underrated. ,pos
 As an adult I am grateful to have caught this movie by chance when I was a teen. During the time I was experiencing familial problems. This particular movie managed to capture what I was seeing from a closeted world. How much peer pressure is too much? I actually had to purchase this movie because it reached me on a level unlike most films try to reach an audience. How far might an individual go for social acceptance? Who is the bad crowd? Teenagers do struggle trying to find out the answers to these questions but ultimately...who is the pack leader if there must be one? Is it the strong? The beautiful? Perhaps the person we just all seem to like? Could it be the moral character? As far as the movie goes the cast worked together as if it were predestined. I only hope that more directors and producers try to create a piece of work that reaches all of us like this particular movie reached me. I wish I could vote higher than ten because this particular title deserves much more. ,pos
 Where to Begin I like the scary snow-monster named Jack Frost. The whole concept works well for me we thought he'd be back and he was. Changing the local to a tropical resort works. Seeing old friends and meeting new characters. Scott MacDonald does a great job as Jack Frost you can tell when an actor has fun playing a villain you can see it or in this case hear it in the performance. Yup Jack Frost 2 is a welcomed sequel that is better then the first. I do have one complaint the little Jacks or the Jacklings as I call them. They looked like hand puppets. I think they could have done a better job with the Jacklings the mouth could have opened wider but the CGI was good and as a whole the whole movie is worth watching over and over again. If you liked JACK FROST then you will like this sequel. No questions or debate 9 BIG STARS. ,pos
 Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best. It is a pivotal film in the Black Exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it. It wasn't necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it's fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that but it was the story of one bad-assed dude fighting whitey with his army of hot kung-fu mama's. It was a guilty pleasure great fun and best to watch it with friends. (10 out of 10) ,pos
 This film is little more than an ersatz Verhoeven. The filming is supposed to be tele-realistic but is simply sickening. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes to be replaced by a story which seems to take itself seriously. The Brechtian pauses for non-existent advert brakes are tedious and even painful; undoubtedly there was no actual intention to render this film Brechtian it was just an accident which happened like that. If you want to see a parody of reality tv watch Celebrity DeathMatch - it's funnier and wittier and most importantly shorter. I have rarely felt so much pain whilst watching a film. To be avoided like a rabid rabbit. ,neg
 Here's example number 87 358 of Hollywood's anti-Biblical bias so typical of them. Early on Ray Liotta's wife has did and women are being interviewed for the position of housekeeper. The first interviewee is an old-fashioned-looking (dress mannerisms speech) who immediately lays down here strict rules stating that there will be two hours of Bible study ever day. This is said of course to make it sound like reading the Bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on someone especially a kid. Once again the Bible is equated with stuffy mean-spirited people. That woman of course is dismissed immediately. Naturally the liberal black woman (Whoopi Goldberg - who else?) is the one who is hired and voilà saves the day! Yawn. ,neg
 The very first time I saw this I recoiled in HORROR at what was being presented as modern liberated women. Sorry but I cannot relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around loveless sex and the acquisition of Gucci Prada and Louis Vuitton labels. The troubling thing is that some may actually think this is how career women live in NYC. It's definitely not. These women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and as another reviewer said they act like gold-digging hooches. This is not liberated womanhood and I'm glad it's gone. 0 stars and just plain AWFUL ,neg
 The eighth and thus second-to-last short of the Animatrix ones this is the only one quite like this. This takes two of the main types of filmed entertainment inspirations of The Matrix and combines them unbelievably well. This is immensely faithful to the trilogy in that aspect the tone. The animation is a gorgeous breathtaking Animé. The style which is omnipresent in this is Noir. The plot is fitting and the story-telling as well as the music is spot-on. The sound in general is fantastic and really helps solidify the mood and atmosphere along with the drawings and designs. The voice acting is impeccable. This is one of only two where people also in the movies reprise their roles and both have Anne-Moss who is the only of them appearing in this. This is one of the best of the nine and also one of my personal favorites. This is about ten minutes long. The pacing is perfect. It never slows down terribly much but it's not overwhelming either. The ending could not have been more appropriate for this. This shares a nine and a half-minutes long making of with Kid's Story and it's well-done and informative. I recommend this warmly to any fan of the universe and the two genres that this is made up of. 8/10 ,pos
 This movie had a very unique effect on me: it stalled my realization that this movie REALLY sucks! It is disguised as a thinker's film in the likes of Memento and other jewels like that but at the end and even after a few minutes you come to realize that this is nothing but utter pretentious cr4p. Probably written by some collage student with friends to compassionate to tell him that his writing sucks. The whole idea is  I don't even know if it tried to scratch on the supernatural or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (a very weak one btw) with stupid riddles the kind you learn on elementary school recess you suddenly come to the one truth about everything then you have to kill someone and confess. !!! What? How what why WHY? Is just like saying that to make a cake just throw a bunch of ingredients and add water forgot about cooking it? I guess these guys forgot to not explain but present the mechanism of WHY was this happening? You have to do that when you present a story which normal everyday acts (lie solving riddle rhymes) start to have an abnormal effect on people. Acting was horrible with that girl always trying to look cute at the camera and the guy from Highlanders the series acting up like the though heavy metal record store (yeah they're all real though s-o-b's). The menacing atmosphere with the oh-so-clever riddles (enter the 60's series of Batman and Robin with guest appearance of The Riddle) and the crazies who claim to have the knowledge behind that smirk on their faces just horrible HORRIBLE. I'm usually very partial about low budget movies and tend to root for the underdog by giving them more praise than they may deserve in lieu of their constrictions you know but this is just an ugly excuse for a movie that will keep you wanting to be good for an hour and a half and at the end you will just lament that you fell for it. ,neg
 A little while ago I stumbled upon this DVD while browsing Netflix and with such an impressive cast decided to give it a go. Never before have I seen a movie try to be a new version of an existing great movie (Scarface) and failing so spectacularly. The main issue seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what the story should be. In Scarface Tony Montana was the self-proclaimed bad guy. His spectacular rise and eventual downfall wasn't sad it was a great (and the only logical ending) to someone who lived such a life. Damian Chapa as director writer and lead actor sees Kilo as some sort of hero or at least a complicated guy. However he doesn't want to do the grunt work of creating a realistic sympathetic character. He was raised by a white mother except for the six months of his childhood where his father a gangster himself showed him his life. For reasons never fully explained or even really mentioned he decides he wants to be a drug dealer and actually drives to the bad part of town approaches two dealers and says Hey I'd like to buy some drugs. He drops his father's name and in apparently no time they are not only rich the two guys who are supplying him are acting subserviently to him for reasons again never explained. Chapa wants you to feel bad when his character is sentenced to prison when a police informant lies about him. However since he's dealt large quantities of drugs before why should one feel sympathy for him going to jail for it this time? The most obvious case of Chapa wanting to be the good guy is in his prison execution of a White Supremacist/rapist played by Gary Busey. In Scarface Tony Montana kills someone in prison because he pretty much has to in order to elevate himself it's done he moves on. But in this case they ham-handedly have to make Busey not only a rapist/pedophile but also a White supremacist. A little overkill don't you think? I won't go into detail in this regard too much more but their desperate message of PLEASE LIKE ME! I'M A COMPLICATED GANGSTER! fails on every level. Try as they might I didn't feel bad conflicted or sympathetic when his buddies are killed (following a shootout) his wife is also killed (shortly after she called him out on being a lousy father and during an attempted escape when he decided it'd be OK to ride right next to a car filled with gunmen while his wife is in the car) and his eventual demise. Suffice it to say his acting can be fairly summed up as lousy his only achievement bringing the term wooden to starry new heights. Busey should be credited for actually putting effort into his ridiculous role. Tiny Lister did well. Stacy Keach is playing his warden from Prison Break role. Robert Wagner is coasting for a paycheck. Faye Dunaway while a touch dramatic still turns in a performance better than this movie deserved. Brad Dourif is in the film for about two minutes and does what he can. And to give the film credit it does one-up Scarface in one way - Jennifer Tilly now holds the title of Most Ridiculous Attempt at a Hispanic Accent. (Sorry Robert Loggia.) In short this movie had an interesting premise but a poor story arc unsympathetic characters and hit-or-miss performances. I'd advise Mr. Chapa to ease up on the forced sympathy next time - really we don't need to like your character we just need to be interested. Better luck next time. ,neg
 This film has not exactly remained fresh in the minds of film buffs and it's a crying shame. Its witty screenplay adaptation should have netted Oscar nominations for the great screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond's adaptation and Ingrid Bergman's flawless performance. It must have been an honor for Goldie Hawn at such a young age to work with Bergman looking more than a decade younger than her 54 years--fifty four! When she's on the screen it positively twinkles. This is a film which may appear dated at first but it actually made me wish I was around during the swingin' 'sixties. Hawn's fashions are as tacky as Bergman's are chic. (That's one minor flaw--isn't her character a little too soignée for a gal who still lives with her sister? But then again would we have Ingrid any other way?) And who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called The Slipped Disc? The best compliments I can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that I never saw and that it left me wanting more. Speaking of wanting more I wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor Rick Lenz? (He resembles Griffin Dunne in this film.) This was his film debut and I don't see any other major roles in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn she's done so much since then it's easy to not be impressed but I can't imagine any other actor in the role either. Since the movie is based on a play the line delivery may seem a bit stage-y but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all. In fact I am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty-five years. Because this film represents a bygone era it has unjustly slipped from the consciousness of film buffs. It is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed. But don't let that stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer. Grade: A ,pos
 1 hour and 40 minutes of talking--boring talking and more talking and then some. It is hard for me to grasp how an actress like Anne Parillaud who shone superbly in Femme Fatale would sign up for such a piece of crap! Unbelievable. If you need a nightcap this movie might help although I would prefer some nice classical music. unfortunately i just found out that i have to write 10 lines for my comment to appear--that's almost as unbelievable! so short and succinct one or two sentence commentaries expressing one's core take on a movie is not enough. geez people. i made my point and don't to waste your time with more unnecessary words--as this movie does.

 John Leguizamo is a great comedian and storyteller. Every time this has been on HBO I've had to stop and watch it. John tells the story of how he grew up (probably some fact and fiction) and adds hilarious stories in the midst. If you like John's comedy I would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best. ,pos
 as i said in the other comment this is one of the best teen movies of all time and one of my personal favorites. to me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time. second only to the breakfast club. the last american virgin is also maybe the most honest teen movie of all time. it's underrated and pretty much an unknown movie to a lot of people. it comes on TBS maybe once a year but sometimes longer. the first half of this movie is a sex comedy with a few honest scenes. then the second half is pure honest and most of the time serious. with only a few comic scenes. in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time. i've never heard this many great songs in one movie before. there are 4 love songs in this movie that i think are some of the best love songs in history. the movie is about a pizza boy named gary who is a virgin. hes in high school who has a couple of best friends. his two friends are sex-sarved teens. the first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures. that are very funny. gary is major in love with the new girl in school. he later finds out that his best friend is going out with her. he also cheats on the side. you can feel the love gary has for this girl very much. you can feel it even more in the second half. gary's friend turns out to be a creep. but his other friend is pretty cool. the movie shows how mean people can be. you can relate to a lot of this movie. the plot sounds like your typcial teen sex comedy. but it's so much more than that. it's a very honest movie. it's also very 80ish which i love. if you love the 80's or grew-up in the 80's rent this movie. but there may be some people that don't like the 80's but still may like this movie. i first saw this movie back in 1987 i think. it's very entertaining and very funny. it combines very touching moments with very funny moments. it's an underrated gem! i have the movie. i love it! i give the last american virgin ***1/2 out of **** ,pos
 LCDR Tom Dodge despite having a reputation among submariners as a renegade and maverick (*note to reader: Maverick does not mean Tom Cruise . Maverick means non-conformist .) is actually an intelligence operative for the Vice Admiral of his submarine fleet. The Vice-Admiral is concerned about our old friends the Russians hosting yard sales with their old diesel fleets. Countries like Lybia North Korea or Iraq would love to get their hands on this baby and slip a nuclear warhead into Norfolk Harbour or Mayport Florida. And this was 6-7 years before 9/11. The Admiral assigns Dodge to assume command of a moth-balled WWII diesel sub and mount an exercise against the surface fleet and the USS ORLANDO a top of the line fast attack sub. Dodge takes command and in no time whips up the bad news bears.. err I mean his lovable group of oddball submariners into warriors. Despite having welcome aboard tattooed on his penis he is a competent and fair commander he does not choose favorites and he delegates authority in a responsible manner. The US NAVY could not have come up with a finer piece of recruitment propaganda than this handsomely made under-appreciated gem from the creator of Police Academy . ,pos
 Once again I must play something of the contrarian. Most of the reviews for Ab Tak Chappan have been extremely positive. Mine is positive but only slightly. A 7 out of 10 is equivalent to a C letter grade from me. It seems that a lot of the praise is rooted in two factors: One that Ab Tak Chappan is more realistic than the typical Bollywood film and two that it is trying to do things differently. The first point I couldn't care less about. I'm not looking for realism in films and so I do not score higher for a film that shows a story and characters closer to how I believe the real world to be--I'm a big fan of surrealism fantasy absurdism and so on although I do not dislike realist films merely for the fact that they're realist. For the second point I agree that it is commendable to try to do things differently. However I don't think originality versus formulaicism makes for a better or worse film in itself. A film can be original and poor just like a film can be formulaic and excellent. What matters are how well the film does whatever it sets out to do and how enjoyable or aesthetically rewarding that is to the viewer. Ab Tak Chappan is based on the true story of a Mumbai cop named Daya Naik. Naik was an encounter specialist . Encounter specialists who could be said to be early instantiations of real world Judge Dredds are trained to operate like the criminals and gang members they pursue and they're basically given a license to kill--effectively acting as policeman judge jury and executioner in a matter of moments. Ab Tak Chappan follows the story of Sadhu Agashe (Nana Patekar) the encounter specialist based on Naik. We see him at work interacting with his fellow encounter specialists and engaging in violence. We see him at home trying to live a normal life in his less-than-luxurious surroundings. We see him trying to adjust to a new commissioner halfway through the film. And we see his odd relationship with a notorious Indian gangster Don Zameer Zafar (Prasad Purandhare). All of this has the potential to make a fabulous gritty film. I agree that it's nice to forgo the typical Bollywood musical numbers and romances--not every film needs that stuff; Ab Tak Chappan producer Ram Gopal Varma is famous for leaving music and romances in the background or by the wayside in many films that he's directed or produced. Additionally Ab Tak Chappan has some good performances--Patekar almost gives off a Death Wish (1974)-era Charles Bronson vibe. It also has admirable cinematography--the hand-held stuff near the beginning of the film was particularly effective for example. It has a great score that mixes more of a moody Hollywood-sounding action/crime score with traditional Indian instruments and modalities. The violence is well done and gritty. There is also decent exploration of subtexts including the morality of (having) encounter specialists the idea of following orders and so on. The encounter specialists are shown having to largely divorce themselves from ideas of right and wrong. More poignantly the film questions the merit of blindly following orders. Parallels are drawn between the encounter specialists following orders and say members of a country's military and we're shown what a corrupt situation this can lead to. But (you just knew there was a But coming didn't you?) director Shimit Amin and his scriptwriters have created a story with far too many characters far too much sprawl and that moves a bit too slow. All of these problems may be due to Amin and crew looking at the Godfather films which Ab Tak Chappan has some (at least superficial) resemblances to although from a policeman's perspective. Most of the encounter specialists we do not get to know very well--these are shallowly drawn characters to say the least except for Agashe and Jatin Shukla (Nakul Vaid). For one Narayan I didn't know who he was until at least halfway through the film. His name is mentioned a number of times but I'd only get glimpses of him until the scene would change. Then everyone would change clothes by the time they appear again and I'd have to start all over figuring out who Narayan was. The same thing happened with Agashe's first commissioner. The film was already far into the new commissioner before I could figure out the relationships. It seems like there are new characters in every scene. We never learn the stories of most of them. While that might have some artistic merit in that the encounter specialists are mostly killing people they do not know anything about (because they're mostly doing so on orders) since we do not learn much about most of the encounter specialists either it's difficult to find characters to care about and that doesn't exactly make for a gripping film. The primary villain is Zameer. But until about halfway through the film there's no indication of this. He doesn't get much more screen time than the other villains parading through the film and he's literally phoning his performance in --he's in another location (Dubai) communicating only by telephone for the majority of the film. We don't actually see Zameer doing much. To an extent the film depends on a couple twists that necessitate not showing Zameer doing a number of things but we could see him do other things and a lot of the other villains could have been left out. That would have tightened up the film a bit making it more focused and about a half-hour shorter both of which would have benefited its impact. This is not an action-packed film by any means. For at least the first 45 minutes or so I found myself admiring Ab Tak Chappan's considerable style but saying Okay get on with the story already . ,pos
 Every time I by pass this show on TV I absolutely and truthfully want to claw my eyes out and rip my ears off.It's so unbelievably horrible.The jokes aren't funny the acting is completely terrible and the whole entire show is one major disappointment.I hate Charlotte Arnold's guts and I just want to punch her in the face or stab her with a knife every time I hear her talk. She is a no talent low IQ big waste on society and I think she would be doing the world a favor if she just shuts the f*ck up and went away for a long time. Please I say this with all my heart DO NOT EVEN WATCH ONE EPISODE OF THIS SHOW!!!!!!It's not even worth 30 minutes of your life and there are thousands of better things to do including killing yourself than watch this show for half an hour. ,neg
 Now I understand that this took two months to shoot. Really? I'm pretty certain my crew could do it in less than a week. This movie sucked so bad I couldn't even pay close attention. Just more proof that boob bearing women can't always save you from horrible writing acting and direction. Now I understand it was a no budget endeavor but there is also no continuity and no real reason to not to turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign news in a language you don't understand. Oh there are a few decent looking females showing the goods. Still there aren't enough sexy women alive to warrant watching this travesty perpetrated on the film industry. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. I trooped it out though with the help of my old friend Jim Beam. Do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you may want to use it after this hack job. Lastly the individual (moron) who left a comment before mine thought this was a great movie and LOVED it. Just more proof that siblings shouldn't pro-create. Ow BURN!!! - Captain J ,neg
 Once again we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists' work has been fully restored and we see this old-time grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling. Inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy etc. In essence this is a story of those goods coming to life such as the animals on the labels of items or a pie or even a pack of cigarettes. The whole show is narrated by Jack Bunny a Jack Benny impersonator with music from conductor Leopold Stokowski who was in so many Looney Tunes animated shorts I have lost count. A lot of the humor is topical so it pays to know who Little Egypt and other characters. The Busby Berkeley-type aqua number with bathing suited-sardines coming out of the can and the tomato can-can dance were both clever! All of the above and more was in the first half of this slightly longer-than-normal length cartoon. The second half was about a King Kong-type which escapes from the Animal Crackers box and terrorizes everyone. That part was not much and ended on a somewhat stupid note. So..... an A for the first half a D for the second making it about a C-plus or B-minus overall. ,pos
 The movie was very good. I'm an avid mystery fan and I usually figure out who is going to be killed and who did the killing. While I did figure out who was going to be killed I didn't figure out who did it. I wasn't happy with the portrayal of the Gerda character but given the year the movie was supposed to take place it is possible the woman would have been that 'cloying'. Please know that while these Poirot movies are good they just don't have the same dynamic to them as the series does because they don't have Japp Ms. Lemon and especially Hastings! David Suchet is definitely Poirot. I have seen every actor who's played him. The worst was Peter Ustinov! ,pos
 There's nothing to say except I want my time back that this movie took from me. I'm not racist against Latinos. Hell I'm half Brazilian. I loved the movie Kids. It doesn't make any sense. These kids just go around and do nothing. They're not even good at skating. The whole time I'm just waiting for something anything to happen! but it doesn't. NOTHING happens the whole movie. Did I mention they suck at skating. I might make a movie called beat up rockers and the whole premise will be about kicking the sh*t out of poser moron punks like these kids. I'm not even going to get into it this movie sucks. Please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it so some other poor soul won't make the same mistake. ,neg
 In complete contrast to the previous correspondent here I thought Shoppen Munich (as it was billed when shown with English subtitles here in London at the German Film Festival in November 2007) was very funny very well acted and excellently scripted. It's quite audacious to design a 100-minute film that consists exclusively and relentlessly of talking heads. But I think Ralf Westhoff succeeded with wit and élan. No standard filmic devices of say following a character's soul-baring pronouncement with some meditative minor-seventh-chord music and long-shot nature cutaways. But when someone said something that revealed their souls - well we were hustled on by the man with the timer for yet another superficial introduction. Which is of course the point: the hurtling tickbox superficiality of thirtysomething urbanites where everything is down to a quick question and answer. Maybe most films are so clichéd and stupid that we English are ready to laugh at any vaguely intelligent and uncontrived cinema but I can promise you that at the screening tonight (Curzon Cinema Sun 25 Nov 2007) the full audience bellowed with laughter most of the way through. So I wasn't the only one guffawing! My girlfriend (who speaks German and has lived in Munich) thought it was hilarious. I (who don't speak German and have not been to Munich I think) thought it was hilarious. I'd recommend Shoppen (Munich) to anyone (especially couples...) looking for a smart witty original wise film about the superficiality of modern relationships and the bewilderment of the generation who feel they've missed out on the happy-ever-after stuff first time round. NB In the English subtitled showing in London the subtitles (which were very good) were shown completely underneath the slightly reduced picture not inside it. I thought this was a Good Thing. ,pos
 I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode it said To Be Continued to the dismay of all the people who had watched the whole boring beyond words thing. It ended as it was supposed to so yes you can blame the series for having no ending. The plan was for there to be another obviously if ratings had been higher but it was a boring show that way too long and annoyed people by not ending when it said it would so they never made any more. Quite a few of the comments blame its cancellation and lack of ending on the viewing public when the truth is that for this show that is not the case it ended the way it was actually planned to end it is just a lousy ending. ,neg
 Well it is standard Hollywood schmaltz that you can see coming a mile off. It's enjoyable in parts but just oh so predictable. I must confess I did not really enjoy it but I am pretty tough to please and a lot of my friends loved it. It is quite sweet and the actors give good performances. It's a nice backdrop and the eye candy is pretty good. But the irritatingly predictable unoriginal and really quite dull storyline holds the film back. Personally I can think of better ways to spend a couple of hours of my life. The chick flick genre gets some bad press but there are some genuinely good chick flicks out there; this isn't one of them. ,neg
 This tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary Mid-Sommerish version of an old Joan Crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. Here people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. A well-heeled London solicitor (Tom Wilkinson) discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeeper's husband in a hit-and-run accident. He throws up but otherwise his stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers. Written and directed by Julian Fellowes who won an Oscar for writing Gosford Park (this is his directorial debut) from a novel by Nigel Balchin it's quite comical although I am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. It's like a throw-back to British films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life. However it's not all bad. Wilkinson is terrific even if you never believe in him as a person while Emily Watson (the adulterous wife) and Rupert Everett (the highly amoral high-class totty) are both very good at covering the cracks in the material. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear it's always good on the eye. ,neg
 Yes bad acting isn't only one thing to mention. Bad script not so bad music. Unfortunately. Nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn't enough for me and for you too. First thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea to have some fun !!! Smiling ... They find everything in the sea. I mean things like fishing-net knife scuba dive things ropes bottles husband ... Woodoo stuff are you kidding. Stupid. They are so happy on the island they are going to die and they are happy. Love peace. Love. Just stupid. Terrible skip this one please. ,neg
 Like classic Hollywood musicals the plot is just an excuse. A must see for those interested in French music hall (including a song by Édith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale. The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan. Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets. Consider it Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in. Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions. ,pos
 A slick production which holds the interest from the very first scene where Max is choosing a ring in a jeweller's shop. Much of what follows reminds us of Shakespeare's A Mid-summer Night's Dream in which Demetrius and Lysander fall in love with each other's girl-friends. Here Max and Lucien both prone to love at first sight get mixed up with Lisa and Alice and Alice complicates things when she calls herself Lisa. On top of the merry mix-up Max is inclined to get involved in incidents which bring back memories of two years ago. And because Max has a lot of these dreamy episodes we are subjected to one flashback after another too many in my opinion because at first viewing of the film I wasn't quite sure if I was in the present or the past.There is much running down corridors stairways through doorways into elevators etc. I accept all that in a fast-paced film but do we have to have so many people colliding with each other? After four collisions it ceases to have any impact if you'll excuse the pun. High marks for art design! The apartment itself is really beautiful with its tasteful decor but I do ask myself how a couple of young women can afford such luxury in Paris. Saving a person intent on suicide from jumping out of a window is always exciting and it is in this film too when Max almost exits at the same time. However a kiss or two soon makes him feel better. If you can manage to find your way through all the flashbacks you'll finally find yourself at the airport where Max's devoted sister gives him a most affectionate kiss. It can be said it is she who resolves the complications of love like Puck in a Mid-summer Night's Dream . ,pos
 Rent this only movie if you're in the mood for laughs (for sheer stupidity) as this movie wouldn't scare a bunch of kindergartners at a Halloween party! The trouble is there is too much gore for kiddies so definitely don't put this in your VCR for the toddlers. It starts off with a little bit of promise giving you the impression that the box cover artist may have actually started watching this film before designing the cover but then descends quickly into epic stupidity. The killer scarecrows are clumsy oafs that are about as scary as the one in the Wizard of Oz but not quite as smart. If they'd only had a brain...? I got this movie for $1.20 at a local discount/close-out store and even so I feel somewhat ripped off. I think with all the other comments posted here if you actually pay to see this you can only blame yourself. ,neg
 A wonderful story...so beautiful told..so intense so whit no keyboard to describe I think... go see it feel it... it tell's a story about love romance war and be trail so wonderful so full of romance if you love romance see it if you don't love romance drama well skip it that's all I can I vote 10 out of 10 stars wonderful... ,pos
 Eleven years ago Stanley Ipkiss released his true inner self and became the hero of Edge City by finding and wearing the Norse god of mischief Loki's mask. The Mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun. Everyone knew how to spell party. P-A-R-T-Y. Why? Cuz I gotta! Now eleven years later it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie Son of the Mask. Someone asked director Lawrence Guterman why are you making this? And he responds Cuz I gotta! Unfortunately that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing Son of the Mask I still left the theatre thinking Good Lord Why? Guterman and the rest of the people involved in the blasphemous film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party. The Son of the Mask begins with Otis the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner Tim Avery a clear homage to legendary Loony Toons creator Tex Avery. Tim played by Jamie Kennedy is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he aspires to one-day draw for. On the night of the company Halloween party Tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous insane character that we all expect. After the party Tim goes home mask still on and conceives a child with his wife. Nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog jealous of the baby's attention puts on the mask and partakes in Tom and Jerry type mayhem to out the baby. Meanwhile Loki played by Alan Cumming is in search for his mask at the orders of his father Odin. First off ill admit that I do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons with its Wile E. Coyote type contraptions and the infamous dancing frog type plot. However this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more of a waste of time. The premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly. Silly is not always a bad thing but in this movie the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying. The characters are not fun to watch and what's worse they're not funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI was used. One of the greatest things about the original is that while obviously computer animation was used so much relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of just being. Jim Carrey we were convinced was an actual cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift. The baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie. The side story of Loki searching for the mask just became more and more stupefying. The son of the Mask is a sad sad state of affairs. What I suggest is you go rent or buy the original the Mask and thank the Norse gods or whoever for bringing it to us. And will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as I continue to ask the infamous question WHY? The son of the Mask gets one star although that star should be divvied up between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey who will always be in my book the mask. ,neg
 If you've ever seen Open Water this is the same kind of gritty edgy indie style of film. i liked the action suspense. the slow building of it all i just hope they don't do to this one what they did to Open Water with that sequel.. but anyways the one thing i didn't like was the annoying younger sister i was rooting for the croc the whole time.. film starts out pretty much like it should kids packing up for a trip they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 mins. before they got there so i guess his assistant takes the two sisters and the boyfriend out on the water now mind you this is the second day of their adventure curiously enough the first day they spent at guess hmm a crocodile farm.. so they are out there and all is good for a little while then bang crocodile time... very intense you know something in this movie you don't see the crocodile a whole heck of a lot but when you do gosh it is very scary i love the croc's snout and eyes and the shroud of fog that seems to enshroud the croc every time he raises his head above the water very very creepy but good overall this is a great film if you can get past the annoying little sister. ,pos
 I really don't have any complaints about this movie except for the disturbing scenes with the body. I fell upon it while switching around the tv one night. The acting was actually amazing I didn't expect it to be better than it appeared! I thought Keanu's(who looks the SAME since 1986 which is a very good thing hehe) acting was really *great* and Crispin played his character perfectly! This movie is a hidden gem! Its a fresh awaking of reality to the '80s compared to the other teen movies done by the brat pack(even though I do like those moives alot too). All in all I give it thumbs up! ,pos
 I have just started watching this show. Its airing in Ireland at the moment on the Irish television station RTE1 at 12.30pm in the Afternoon (as of 26th July 2006). This program literally makes me laugh out aloud and I cannot boast that on most sitcom's (apart from UK's 'The Office' with Ricky Gervais in it). Todays episode of TKoQ (26 July 2006)was the one where Carrie starts a new job and invites her friends home and goes off to make some coffee and Doug wants Carrie to have no 'outside' friends so he lifts up his top and shows off his 'belly hair!' and licks plates when he goes out to dinner! But another funny episode was the other week when the old fella (carries Dad) won on the Bingo and that episode creased me up with laughter especially when they went out and got a replacement fridge and Carries father stood there looking at it and thought it was new. So I don't know how much longer this has got to run on Irish TV or at which stage (year recorded) we are at but I hope it don't end soon because I am really enjoying it. To sum up there is some great writing some great characters and comedy acting (namely by Carrie Doug and Carries father) some great punchlines and delivered well - a bit saucy and near the mark sometimes (send the kids out the room!) but i think this US Sitcom is a winner and very funny. ,pos
 As you can see I loved the book so much I use the title for my internet alias and have for over 15 years. (Okay so it had to be spelled phonetically to fit the name character limit for the BBS at the time but what could I do?) If anyone every finds this movie I would absolutely love to see it! Janet McTeer is great in everything else I've seen of hers. I think she would have made a great Prue. And it even features early Clive Owen - from before Chancer (a great series itself). What's not to love? I hope the powers that be wise up and make this available on DVD soon! With some of the true dredge they pout out it's about time well executed productions make it on the market too. ,pos
 Sally and Saint Anne is a very funny movie. The first time my Mom told me about it I was 7 and Saint Anne had just been the Saint I had for my Communion Saint. My Mom knew this so she told me to watch this with her. I did and have seen it many times since because it is really funny. Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith Show was in it and Sally's grandfather was the guy who played Santa Claus in Miracle On 34th Street. So there were lots of actors we seen on TV shows too. There is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away and Sally keeps trying things with St. Anne to help raise money so they can keep the house. That includes a boxing match with Hugh O'Brian who plays her older brother. This is a good and funny movie that I still love. ,pos
 Expectacular THE ATOR's second part!! Directed rapidly by JOE D'AMATO specialist in all kinds of subkinds(subgenres) of exploitation and interpreted again by MILES O'KEEFFE. the budget of the movie debio to be derisory or minimal. In spite of not being a better movie of his antecesora not mas entertained ATOR 2 either it has something something that makes it enterteining. His introduction you prop it explains ATOR's origin to us with images of the first part. The script is incredible is like any comic-book of the brilliant ROY THOMAS. has so fantastic elements inside dle world of the SWORD and such FANTASY as invisible men black gentlemen cannibals - monkeys ... the role of the villain this one interpreted brilliant. The final this struggle very well. lacking mas violence and blood but this one well. Never it becomes boring. It has everything what there was lacking ATOR 1. Be charmed with to my me!! 4/5 ,pos
 I saw and have the original 1959 black and white that stars Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins and no matter how many times I watch it I can't help but not to cry. This version was (obviously) a set like the 1959 was but there were so many mistakes in layout. Spiral staircase? Items that did not exist in that time period existed in the film. Doris Roberts sad to say CANNOT play drama she a comedic actress and that will not change. James Coco was a horrible Mr. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel resembled a college professor of mine rather then the dentist he was supposed to play. In the original film Anne walked the gauntlet to go to Peter's room that seemed to take her more then a minute. In this crappy remake it took her under 10 seconds. The first reviewer was correct... This remake is just that a remake. What was the director thinking casting comedic actors in a drama role like that. I'm sorry but James Coco cannot play drama. Max.. Schell was better in Deep Impact then this movie. The cranky Mrs. Frank was just that cranky I couldn't stand her. Referencing and comparing to the 1959 version I like her better she did a better job of being the overwhelming mother. Out of 10 stars I give this remake 3. Don't waste your time get the 1959 version and a box of Kleenex. ,neg
 The Seven-Ups is a good and engrossing film. It's packed with credible performances by Scheider LaBianco and an effective scary performance by Richard Lynch - although most of the characters are card-board cut-out tough guys. Character development does not evolve at all on the screen. The only thing we know is the good guys are the good guys and the bad guys are bad. Deviating from the crime story norm The Seven-Ups manage to throw Scheider and crew into the middle of a building plot in a unique writing twist. Onsite locations of New York City and an excellent choreographed car chase highlight the film. The only downside of the film is the slightly confusing plot line in the beginning. They give the viewer little evidence that the men being kidnapped are mob related (until later in the film). Had someone blindly started watching the film may be slightly confused on the story. Otherwise The Seven-Ups is a gritty testosterone-filled enjoyable time. ,pos
 As a film buff I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon ). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation. HE really enjoyed it and - after trying to block out all the negative prejudices I obviously had about the film - so did I. There is nothing especially bad about Lost Horizon and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970's movies. It isn't even especially camp. The lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic but this isn't really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them. As for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune this criticism falls apart since Liv Ullmann Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were dubbed (brilliantly too as the vocals match their speaking voices perfectly) and Sally Kellerman has a really lovely and totally unique singing style. Vocally Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey on The Things I Will Not Miss is excellent. Special mention should be made of the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer's brilliant performance as the High Lama - and his comments about mankind destroying itself are chillingly apt to today's fractured world. I wouldn't claim for a second that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece (The things I wouldn't miss about it are the uninspired choreography and Bobby Van's Question Me An Answer number which could easily have been cut) but if you haven't even seen Lost Horizon or haven't seen it for some time try watching without that Oh boy let's have a laugh at this pile of junk attitude and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is. ,pos
 **** Possible Spoiler **** If you were making a serious movie involving a powerful but aging father with three apparently ungrateful daughters featuring actors of the highest caliber with great cinematography and a beautiful Midwestern setting now where would you go with it? Why you'd fashion a modern tragedy after King Lear of course. That's what I was expecting. That certainly wasn't what I got. What I got was 105 minutes of feminist tripe--one long harangue about man's inhumanity to woman. Why there wasn't a decent male in the entire story. You see early on where this film might be headed but you can't believe anyone would waste all these fine actors and craftsmen on that trite scenario--you just want them to get on with the King Lear theme. But it never happens; and there's the real tragedy if you ask me. Aside from the panorama of glorious rural heartland about the only thing worth watching in this film was that wonderful chameleon British actor Colin Firth practicing his Midwestern accent. Now there was a treat. 3/10 ,neg
 I really liked this movie. I watched it last night on the Public Broadcasting System. The part I liked about it was the fact that they dealt with issues of today not in the future or the past. They basically had some terrorists take a van or two and rent them out to be car bombs. I think what the movie could have showed was people in different countries at the same time. It did show the fact that England or any other country isn't prepared for an attack on the magnitude that they showed. I have never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie so I can't really say if they are normally their parts. After the movie they had this panel of experts talking about if something like that could happen here in the U.S. It was a thought-provoking discussion! ,pos
 At least the jingle by Tim Finn was melodic. Roberts is the his usual inept self. Characters are inconsistent dull purposeless. Roberts changes his accent even within one line. ,neg
 Ugh what an embarrassing episode last night! It was either a failed script for ABC Afterschool Special or the product of an earnest rookie writer just out of college making an homage to that classic PC anti-gun homily from 1974 The Gun . In fact hubby & were disappointed that the closing shot wasn't of The Gun being melted down like in the movie! No I'm not some NRA shill. It's just that when the producer of an intelligent & nuanced series gets it in his head that I should be subjected to a didactic dramatization of his personal Cause I'd appreciate it if the lecture at least wasn't delivered via 2-by-4. Geez! OK the sociology lesson is over. The Message has been delivered. The Important Episode has been aired. Now let's get back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence. ,pos
 Ridiculous nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly superficially and condescendingly trawling all the most banal clichés about Tuscany and Italy divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow Tuscan lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?) which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You've never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever and therefore quite worth a look. ,neg
 These are the kinds of movies I loved and still love growing up. Unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them. This movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoy. There was some film student earlier that complained it wasn't A list material. But that is not the point. The point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge CGI Cliché' filled movies. There are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you and not get as much money as they can. Besides its also nice to know that good ol' Bruce isn't dead yet. ,pos
 I know we shouldn't expect much from a low-budget indie film. But the idea behind it is sound: an attempt to open America's eyes to the cozy relationship between the government and the journalists that are supposed to be keeping an eye out against it. But somehow the documentary aspect of it takes away from its drama. The protests during the 2004 Republican convention in New York were not that compelling to make a documentary about it. Those kinds of compelling protests belong to the era of the 1960's. It would have been better to stick to a drama format. Perhaps a slow build-up where the young journalist's eyes are gradually opened up to the conspiracy. ,neg
 This is my all time favorite Looney Tunes cartoon. It's a common plot: Daffy Duck tries to convince Elmer Fudd that it is really rabbit season and shoot Bugs. But your can never outsmart that rabbit! In addition to usual cartoon comedy this cartoon is supported by great word play that will keep you rolling on the floor. ,pos
 I would have given this movie a 1 but I laughed so hard so many times that I had to give it a little credit in the off off off off chance the film was Supposed to be funny. A movie so bad you'll think chimps wrote it. You'll wish chimps had written it. Dialogue so canned that only it and the cockroaches will survive the coming nuclear holocaust. The movie Exaggerates its awfulness by intersplicing scenes from the Original Carrie (a really good film) into scenes from this one. Like intersplicing scenes from Taxi Driver into Baby Geniuses. Do not rent it alone as you will NOT enjoy the experience. You will need someone next to you to confirm the badness of what you are viewing. Worst actress of the Millenium goes to poor poor Amy Irving as the stone-faced monotone disastrously wooden school counselor. Worst movie of the year so far (see also _Arlington Road_). --FRINK-3 ,neg
 This has got to be one of the worst films I have ever seen! The cast is an international one - Australian-pretending-to-be-British stage American and a character with an English name sporting an unrecognizable European accent. What passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity. So short were the shoestrings of this film's budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition. In the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and stalk'n slash thrillers of extraordinary (though not necessarily high ) quality which have been made on no budget at all. Recent examples include the poorly made but totally scary Blair Witch Project and of course - the most recent - that low-budget winner SAW featuring practically unknown leads (Gary Elwes is just someone you don't remember even if you have seen him before). In DARKHUNTERS it is shocking to find a known character actor Dominique Pinon and Hollywood has-been Jeff Fahey struggling valiantly to save the film. It is embarrassing to see the once handsome leading man (Fahey) in corny makeup uttering bizarrely bad lines. I would have rated this film 0 out of 10 had that been possible! ,neg
 Out of 15 people I loaned this movie too.. NO One finished it.. It was so Awfully.???????? Not good... Just awful. She sits in a chair the whole movie. She's in a Closet. The Chair she's sitting is nice. I can't think of anything more to say. But 10 lines of text. To print this up. My friend Nick thinks this is a great movie. because he can give it to his friends and not have to worry about THOSE calling him back. He's passed it around as a gag movie for 10 years. Which is how I got it.. Then.. I tried to get my friends to finish this extremity's awful awful piece of crap... To no aval.. no one could finish it.. Takes boredom to a whole new level. They could use this in Iraq INSTEAD OF WATER BOARDING... PLEASE SEND COPIES Guantanamo BAY CUBA. Makes great Xmas gift. ,neg
 For all its many flaws I'm inclined to be charitable towards Thing . There is the nugget of an interesting creepy claustrophobic Hitchcock style story here. Put this in the hands of a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer British perspective) Robert Bloch or the guy who wrote Day Of The Triffids and you might have had a nasty unsettling little spook story that was the best thing in an book anthology of horror and suspense stories. However someone chose to tell this story as a feature length movie and a cheap 2nd rate at that and so most of the potential is wasted. A story like this really needs a voice like Sturgeon's to bring out interesting quirks of character in a better light. His classic story The -widget- the -wadget- and Boff is an example of how he can gather together an isolated group of ordinary characters and in the space of 40 pages can turn them into the most amusing sympathetic and fascinating people you've ever met. A good writer can with a few chosen words make the reader see some of the most vivid and memorable events ever to scar his emotions. Instead we get a movie where some of the most irritating and unlikeable characters ever made are lumped together and made to interact in unconvincing Where did that come from?? moments that just lie there. (IE the blond psychic girl declaiming that You're all evil and I hope you are destroyed! ). We get leaden pacing and slow motion blocking and dull sets and stiff actors. I blame the director for the 'stiff and shallow' part. These are all 3rd rank character actors who never made the big time but they are also 'real' actors and a good director could have gotten better performances out of them. We get uncalled for lesbian overtones that make the viewer feel uneasy and exploited without delivering any kind of payoff. (If I'm going to have my baser instincts exploited and feel guilty about it I want done by stuff staged better than this). And we get over an hour of creepy build-up diffused in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climaxes I've ever seen. Good things about Thing ? Um well...some of the closeup shots of the warlock's head silently mouthing its directives were pretty effective. The miserly and shrewish widow rang true to life (even if I wanted to stuff a sock in her mouth). The first scene where the big simple ranch hand silently turns on the oily cowboy and kills him had a bit of shock value because the plot had taken the trouble to establish the big guy as a fairly sympathetic character. And like I said earlier the idea of an insidious force from the past turning the members of an isolated community against each other is a good one and can sustain interest far above the actual merit of a bad performance. Which this definitely is. But as I said I'm inclined to be charitable because the director was probably working under a penurious budget breakneck time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money. Heaven knows how future generations will judge facile crap like The Cave Wrong Turn or the remake of House of Wax 40 years from now. I hope they are charitable towards our own tastes in supporting our generations wastes of film stock. ,neg
 This is one cheap looking movie! A stripper keeps getting attacked and raped by zombies and no one believes her. She goes to the police who also rape her. She finally finds a kid who was also attacked by the zombies and they trace the zombies back to 'The Zombie Master'. The fact that Stephanie Beaton stars as the stripper is the only reason to watch this film. ,neg
 Warning--this film has some amazingly graphic images and should never be seen by kids. The artist who this story is all about was indeed a fine Korean painter who rose up from the lowest depths to become their greatest painter. Unfortunately in so many ways this guy was also a jerk in so many ways. Some of this was the artistic temperament and what may have seemed annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But other times he was simply a drunk jerk--especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. Late in the film his being annoying abrasive and needlessly cruel seemed to have diminished. While all this didn't make him a particularly nice man it is important to capture on film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist. I really found the movie fascinating and loved how the artists actual works were shown throughout the movie (like in LUST FOR LIFE). I really wish I could show this to my students (I teach at a school for the arts) but can't because there is just too much adult material. Yes there is nudity but even more problematic for any audience (particularly younger ones) is when he ....hmmm ...I don't think IMDb will even let me describe what occurred but it was very graphic and involves bodily fluids. Not only a nasty and disgusting scene that did NOT need to be seen but a reason to keep junior from watching this otherwise wonderful film. It's a real shame. ,pos
 At first I didn't think I would like this movie but as it progressed it became better and better. I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin. My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart. The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli's bravado was irritating but soon he grew on you. The twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the Germans. I would like to see this again to follow all the side plots. I also want to buy the sound track to hear the music again. ,pos

 I saw this movie about 12 years ago and I can still remember it as if I just saw it recently. That is how much this movie has affected me. Considering this is a movie from the 50's I think it was ahead of its time. It surprised me as in how it maintains its integrity in this subject some might have considered taboo back then. Very realistic in showing the tumultuous and heartwretching journey that an addict chooses to embark on. One can only imagine how the audiences were affected by the realism of this movie back in those days. I personally think is was one of Frank Sinatra's top five performances in the big screen. When others are discussing movies dealing with Mental Illness and/or addiction I always recommend The Man with the Golden Arm as one of the top five to watch. ,pos
 This film is about a bunch of misfits who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably. The misfits pull together to successfully complete their mission. Hilarity ensues. Like the Police Academy films the humor comes from the kooky characters on the boat. I thought it was an engaging film and I will stop to watch it anytime it is on TV. No it won't cause you to ponder your relative role in the cosmos or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind but it is fun enough entertainment for 90-some-odd minutes. Plus Lauren Holly looks hot in a naval uniform. ,pos
 A typical old b&w film. The dialogues are sometimes good but too often - especially in the second half - they get naive sometimes awfully naive occasionally close to the point where they are unintentionally comical. The first third with its background information on Ladd's Gatsby shown with a series of interesting flashbacks is the best part of the movie. But once Gatsby moves into his new villa and makes his moves on Betty Field the film gets overly melodramatic. The ending is yet another cop-out ending; I don't know whether the novel itself contains this dumb clichéd ending or whether the movie's producer made some changes to it but I've always considered car-accidents to be a poor way to add drama to the conclusion of a story. I've seen this plot-device a million times (or if it's not a car then it's a fall from a horse); the writer doesn't know how to end the story but he knows that he wants it to be dramatic so he adds in a car-accident. Lame. And to make things worse the accident is outrageously coincidental and preposterous both plot-wise and time-wise; plot-wise because Field's husband's mistress (Winters) gets killed by Field and the fact that Winters sort of rushes out from the gas-station into the street as though she'd never noticed in the years that she had lived in it that there was a dangerous road right across her house - and of course at the very moment that she comes out she sees Ladd's car and mistakes it for Field's husband's car and then shouts Over here! I'm here! Run me over and make the ending tragic that way! ; time-wise because Ladd and Field get involved in an accident at the very day when they are preparing to tell Field's husband about their affair. Basically there is just too much forced and artificial irony in this accident. It also doesn't exactly help this movie how Winters's husband Da Silva goes on a revenge mission to kill the guy who ran over his wife; he basically does this by walking around like a zombie going from car to car looking for scratches and acting very badly indeed. Both Da Silva's acting and his character's behaviour throughout the film are awful and confusing respectively. Scott Fitzgerald was upset on a couple of occasions how his novels were adapted for the screen by Hollywood's screenwriters and - although he was dead long before this movie was done - he might have been right to complain judging by this film's naive script. Or maybe his novels are even sillier and more naive than this film and were actually improved upon by the screen adaptations. Or the films are pretty much like the novels. I could of course read this particular novel to find out but I just can't be bothered. Fitzgerald's name doesn't exactly inspire me to read any of his books (and I don't mean the way his name sounds.) He was certainly no Heller Clavell or Twain. More like Hemingway  a lot of noise about nothing. ,neg
 As a zombie fan I really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters! PB is also an excellent tie-in to Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness. There are so many metaphors in the story! Riddick is this bad guy but he's also the hero who tries to save the slow-paced folks. The Muslim guy Imam relies on the sun's positions for the five times a day prayers but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule. Overall I recommend this film to any sci-fi fans. You won't be disappointed. ,pos
 i think the title of the movie describes it well. if you are looking for a documentary on louis kahn and his work you'll have to look somewhere else. although some of that is covered in this film. of course i eat up pretty much anything i'm fed and i don't know much of the family history revolving around this case. so i believed what i was told about nathaniel and his father etc. for what this movie was i thought it was pretty good. a little slow and grabbing for attention at time i wish that nathaniel would have focused a little more on his father's work than his family drama (although much of the history was interesting louis was a bit of a player). this really is a journey through someone's life and i was happy to tag along for the experience. a learning experience for me and so it seems for the filmmaker as well. oh and the footage of some of kahn's work is *stunning* ,pos
 Wow. The storyline to this was just incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie was supposed to be of a comedic genre. But still even nonsense is supposed to make at least some vague sort of sense. Water has become incredibly rare substance? Well that's strange considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most plentiful substances there is in the universe. And pretty easy to make. Glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms and voilà water. Instead of water the rarity of dilithium crystals or some such thingamajig should have been used as a plot device as something the pirates would go after. Water as a plot device was just dumb dumb dumb. The comedy seemed labored and contrived and forced. The comedy in the TV series Red Dwarf was labored and contrived and forced but it was actually amusing. Here instead i felt like saying Ha ha that was just so funny i forgot to laugh... Sigh... all that money put into sets costumes actors... what a waste... Rather than just whimper and whine and complain at it's lameness my recommendations to make it better: 1) Use a believable plot device. 2) Get rid of the comedy . None of the actors were really any good at it. The movie would work better as a serious action adventure. The obvious intention of the writers was to do a spoofy comedy but they didn't quite pull it off. It's not likely i'll ever watch this again. It's too much a total hack job. ,neg
 I can't believe I missed this one. Made in 1970 with a budget that would probably allow you to make one indifferent episode of a TV soap this is 90 minutes of sustained sharp as a knife film making. You will find the outline plot etc elsewhere on this site.Consider though that the whole thing was shot using a single hand- held 16mm camera... all the dialogue is improvised... none of the 'actors' had appeared in front of a camera before... It sounds like a recipe for disaster. Instead what we get is hippies v cops running around in the California desert in what evolves into a 'that's not fair.. i'm on that person's side'scenario. The only problem is the director keeps making you shift your allegiance and at the end of 90 minutes we're still not sure who has one. Brilliant... Quite brilliant. ,pos
 The antiwar musical Hair is my number one cult-movie. I do not know how many time I have seen this film in the movie-theaters and on VHS or how many times I have listened the CD with the stunning soundtrack and now this masterpiece has been finally released on DVD in Brazil. The pacifist and touching story is still amazing a hymn of freedom friendship and liberty of choices and pictures the resistance of a generation against the stupidity of war. I do not know what happened to this wonderful generation of the counterculture of the 70's and their dreams since the present world is probably worse than in the 70's. I do not recall who won the Oscar in 1979 but Treat Williams and John Savage deserved at least a nomination for their awesome performances. Beverly D'Angelo is extremely gorgeous in the role of a hypocrite spoiled upper-class teenager. I have seen Hair probably more than twelve times and my eyes always get wet while Berger walks to the airplane singing That's me that's me that's me and I start crying with his gravestone in the cemetery. I believe this is one of the most beautiful sad and touching conclusions of the cinema history. My wife my daughter and my son also love this film; therefore I can guarantee that Hair is timeless and recommended for any audience. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): Hair  ,pos
 I would assume that this film would get rave reviews in Canada--particularly in Quebec. That's because the Canadians have traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadians were like gods in Canada for decades. As an American the closest thing we have to them are the New York Yankees. If you are a fan then they are the greatest and winningest team in history. If you are not a fan then they are Satan's team!! Well at least that's how it was as I grew up in Washington DC in regard to the Dallas Cowboys. So I am pretty sure when this film was shown up North that everyone immediately had a strong emotional reaction--their national sport AND the closest thing they have to a national team in the NHL. Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it begins and the main character talks about growing up around Ottawa and rooting for the Canadians AND Maurice the Rocket Richard. However when his mother accidentally buys him a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey and forces him to wear it I knew right away what a horrible and shameful thing this would be to a little boy. This ability to connect to the character--even though he lives in a far off land is what made this a very special short film. The way the other kids treated him and his conversation with God at the end make this a lovely nostalgic film. Very clever and memorable. ,pos
 One should not be too critical about the director's second feature. I really like the camera work of Madiba. As Mr. Shawn pointed out he had a unique way of looking at things. However howcome a 14 year old boy shoot such beautiful images? Remember he has not got any education of any sort. I don't think english is the common tongue in Cape Town ghettos. Worse still Madiba looks even smaller than his supposed age of 14. Any way if you overcome above-mentioned peculiarities you can watch the film and still enjoy it because of nice camera work. ,pos
 The plot involves a new hipper franchise barbershop that is moving across the street from Calvin's barbershop. So he feels like he has to change and improve his shop by getting newer stuff and such. Sounds real exciting huh. As for the rest of the film a lot of it involves the same material from the first film. The people that work at Calvin's stand around talk loud and mouth off to each other and the customers. Once again Cedric the Entertainer was mildly funny but it is more like he's doing a stand-up routine than anything to do with the movie. And Calvin is faced with another moral issue involving taking a large sum of money. He's already shown that he will do the right thing in the end. FINAL VERDICT: Nothing new. I don't recommend it unless you thought the first Barbershop was the best thing since sliced bread. ,neg
 A political satire of a comedian (Williams) who after dissing the political campaigns and presidents is forced into the running. But shockingly we wins and makes a mockery of the office. Man of the Year is not the funniest movie nor the best but in small doses it does work. Williams again teaming with Levinson after a hit with Good Morning Vietnam . The two seem to have a great chemistry and work off each other. I am not comparing them to Scorsese and DeNiro but you can get the picture. Although I wouldn't quite say to rush out there and see the movie in theaters I would recommend renting it. This movie is a comedy but also has a great satire please if you like movies like Scary Movie 4 this is not for you take your brain with you to see it. - *** ,pos
 A real insult to the original Spoorloos which is one of the most genuinely disturbing films (and I intend this as a compliment!) I have seen in the last years. Where the original is chilling and brilliant the remake is flat and even boring especially the happy end finale takes away what little suspense there was in this film in the first place. While such a distortion (especially grafting a happy end which wasn't there previously) is quite frequently the case in Hollywood remakes of European art-house movies and could've been expected the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this inane mess was created by the very same filmmaker who did the original Spoorloos ... Why Mr. Sluizer decided to ruin his masterpiece in such a fashion is beyond me. Avoid this abomination at all cost as it might spoil the original for you even if watched *after* that let alone the other way round... ,neg
 Watching this film caused quite an emotional reaction. This is what today's documentaries are all about. It's refreshing to watch something so personal honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully. One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good. I feel that I now know more about marriage...about women. Definitely check this out it'll make you think - exactly what a good documentary should be designed to do. ,pos
 What can I say? I couldn't sleep and I came across this movie on MTV. I started watching it with every intention of changing the channel if it started to get lame as so many anti-drug movies do but I got sucked into this movie and I couldn't stop watching. Nick Stahl did an amazing job with his character and in my opinion he really made the movie something worth watching. I was interested in purchasing the soundtrack to the movie (or even the movie itself) and MTV.com was no help at all but believe it or not Amazon.com is taking pre-orders for the August 5th release of the movie on DVD. I know I had a hard time tracking it down and I'm sure other people might have had the same problem. I'm buying my own copy so I can drool over Nick Stahl while bawling my eyes out at the same time thanks to the emotional storyline! ,pos
 With actors like Depardieu and Richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie. But Weber is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth. This movie is high on story but low on character. You never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick. Unfortunately Weber has no idea what slapstick is all about. His style could be described at hit and miss. Of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor at this lot. It is a shame how bad he uses good talent. Many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors. ,neg
 Shadows is often acclaimed as the film that was the breakthrough for American independent cinema. Whether thats true or not it is an undeniably important film one whose influence can be traced all the way to today's Sundance fodder. Here is a film which tackles controversial topics of the day (namely racism) and refuses to give easy answers and show them in a manipulative fashion. Also it deals with sex in a frank manner that Hollywood wouldn't even discuss until The Graduate . Still the question remains is it as powerful today as when it was originally released? The answer is yes. While many important films are hard to watch and dated nowadays Shadows retains every ounce of emotional resonance when viewed now. It deals with racism as a personal issue and not a political one so its still relevant. Plus it works as a great time capsule capturing the 1950s beat generation and New York art scene in a way possibly no other film has. On a technical level its admittedly uneven. Cassavetes had yet to gain full confidence as a director and the choppy editing reflects the film's low budget. Still the film's story is remains powerful. Plus the acting considering the inexperience of the cast and improvisational nature is phenomenal. All around the actors create realistic characters ones who remain sympathetic despite their often less than admirable actions. Shadows is absolutely mandatory viewing for film buffs. (9/10) ,pos
 There's something about a movie that features female bodybuilders that gets me in front of the screen every time. I've seen Pumping Iron II Aces: Iron Eagle III Raven Hawk and even the TV movie Getting Physical which featured some big names in the sport. They were tolerable in their own ways (mostly because they featured Rachel McLish. ROWWR!!). Then I went and watched Nemesis III: Prey Harder on the sole basis that it featured such luminaries as Sue Price Debbie Muggli Sharon Bruneau and Ursula Sarcev. Love the ladies always will but after this I'm kinda glad I missed the first two Nemesis flicks. Well the first one anyway. Most of the footage here is lifted bodily (and kicking and screaming I would guess) from Nemesis II . Actually that one looked marginally entertaining from the evidence supplied here. But even though Price and company flex and pose they don't get much of a chance to do anything else (like say ACT!). In fact this whole film is an exercise (Get it? Ha-ha...) in oblique story-telling ambiguous characters and open-ended movie-making (in terms of filming as well as the story-line). Nothing makes much sense but even if it did there would still be issues - such as making such small parts for such larger-than-life women as these. What a crime. Of course it was written and directed by Albert Pyun so what did you expect: cohesion? One star only in consideration for all the hard work that Price Muggli Bruneau and Sarcev obviously put into their bodies NOT the craft work done within the movie itself. Thanks ladies. ,neg
 THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is a superb example of an anti-80s film. While many other films of the decade in general lacked substance this film is pure substance. There's nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it. It boasts two superb performances: Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as lifelong friends Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee respectively. Hutton Penn and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things (all 3 starred in TAPS). While Penn and Cruise's popularity soared Hutton has been largely forgotten about and that's a shame. Actually Hutton is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar for supporting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980 but I think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding. Hutton really captures the post-Vietnam war rebelliousness in his character Chris Boyce. A failed seminary school student Chris has a love-hate relationship with his father well played by the great character actor Pat Hingle. The scene where Chris quotes the poem his father thought he'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one. Chris gets job at Dept. of Defense and uses his hatred of U.S. gov't and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviets. He gets his buddy Daulton a hyper drug-dealing self-server in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm. While Chris is doing it based on his beliefs Daulton is doing it strictly for the money. The Soviet liaison is excellently played by David Suchet. Penn and Suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it's a kind of funny set of exchanges between them. But make no mistake this film is anything but that. It is a serious character study about pessimism malaise paranoia and mistrust. Again the leads make this film. Hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Chris a rather smart young man who had so much potential. Penn as usual does a tremendous characterization as Daulton a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks and most of the time doesn't think at all. The ending of this fact-based film is very saddening on several levels. A truly powerful character study. ,pos
 Bill Paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 US golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. The film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-Catholic prejudices of both the British and American establishments. But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds. The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual but the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf who delivers a disciplined dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. For those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in Even Stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears. A old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie. ,pos
 Being a long-time Steve Martin fan it hurt to see him in a movie with such a cliched script. The screenwriter must have just rented some videos and taken a piece here and a piece there - it certainly is about the least imaginative movie I've seen in a long time - I knew exactly what was going to happen in each scene as soon as it began. The African-American stereotypes and slave references are pretty offensive as well. But the thing that was the worst for me was to see Martin in a movie without a trace of wit. He probably is one of the most intelligent actors and here he totally sold out to a totally dumbed down script. He must be behind in his alimony to be in such a lame effort. ,neg
 While the film has one redeeming feature namely some striking shots e.g. the shot of the sheep hanging from the tree the scene of the funeral procession on the raft or the scene of the boats leaving the village (which seemed influenced by the scene when the warships approach in the fantastic Fellini Satyricon ) these were more photographic than cinematographic and would have been better appreciated hung on a wall in an art gallery than embedded in a painfully slow-paced film that comes in at a whopping 162 minutes and suffers from terrible dialogue extremely poor character development over-acting uninspired symbolism and heavy stylisation. This is the first film I have seen by Angelopoulos and his reputation having preceded him I expected a lot better but can honestly say that this is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I won't go out of my way to watch any of the director's other work in the future. The four friends I went to see it with agree. ,neg
 I agree that this movie is about sex without any seduction or love. In fact it makes sex seem so boring and makes me wonder why bother. I actually don't think at all this remotely speaks of how Canadian Indian second generations feel about sex. At any rate did you know the first hotel/drunk idea was copied from a Korean movie Yopgijogin gunyo made in 2001 or thereabouts? That Korean film was actually brilliant as comedy but at the same time compels the audience to reflect on the complexity of man-woman relationships and man-woman difference in experience and thinking. I mean most of the Neal N Nikki hotel/drunk segment was emulated take by take. Can't Bollywood movie makers try to make originals only please? Seriously I never enjoyed a Hindi flick that is a copycat. The ones I enjoy have always spoken Indian feelings through Indian cultural means. ,neg
 Jack Frost 2 is out of the question I'm actually surprised people are allowed to make these sort of movies. As Sam and his wife take to the Tropicana for a relaxing Christmas Jack returns to kill off the fun and take on a revenge with inbreeding... Don't take a swip at this film at all most people say its a laugh with your mates but frankily its a waste of time. If the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do they can at least take the time and effort to write up a better story especially the cheesy character names. ,neg
 I loathe despise and hate this film with a passion that makes the red hot gates of hell look cold by comparison. it's nothing but a campy frightening and completly shoddy trip down memory lane to that oh-so-nasty time the 70's a decade im glad i wasnt a part of if this absolute trite is all that was on offer! the animation is sickeningly dated not least of all with it's tacky missing frames and characters with huge bulbous heads this film is an eye-sore. from the knowing snide nod to the parents with the freakily gay sea horse and it's camp hand motions and kenneth williams-esque voice to the overtly unsubtly druggy anthem High Cockalorum this film im sad to say is one that was forced upon me as a child and i have never fully recovered from the terror it caused me.... This ghastly display of complete terribleness should carry an R rated certificate so disturbing it is in it's contents! ,neg
 Dakota Incident has to be one of the strangest westerns I've ever seen. Not good but definitely strange. A driver-less stagecoach rides into the town of Christian Flats with all passengers killed. It's scheduled to go on but very few for obvious reasons want to risk the Cheyennes on the warpath out there. But Linda Darnell Regis Toomey John Lund Whit Bissell and Ward Bond each have their reasons for going on. And Dale Robertson who killed John Doucette in a gunfight after Doucette and Skip Homeier shot and left him for dead in the desert is so anxious to go he's willing to drive the team. Of course the Cheyennes attack the intrepid group of passengers if forced into a dry wash for cover. Who will live and who will die is the remainder of the film. Dakota Incident came at the very end of Republic Pictures before Herbert J. Yates pulled the plug on his little studio. Westerns were their specialty but normally of the kind Roy Rogers made. This would not have been a Rogers product. In fact it's beyond belief. The characters aren't ground in any kind of reality. Whit Bissell is taking back ore samples from his claim but Robertson discovers it's iron pyrites fool's gold. Toomey is a guitar playing cynic who goes mad from thirst. Darnell is after a cheating manager of her's but really doesn't know what to do when she finds him. Lund is looking to bring in Robertson who committed a crime he took the rap for but has to bring him in alive. For that he'd require help but doesn't have any. But the worst is Ward Bond who's a United States Senator on his own peace mission to the Cheyennes. In real life Bond was a most right wing individual and I'm not sure this wasn't some kind of a caricature of what he would perceive as a liberal. He's really quite the fatuous fool but I think that might have attracted him to the role. I tried to get into Dakota Incident but couldn't. And the ending was a bizarre fantasy to say the least. Give it three stars for the cast involved. ,neg
 This is another of those rare movies one feels grateful to be introduced to instead of the usual Hollywood tripe. It really is a roller coaster ride as we follow the effects of a a forged 500 Euro note on a multitude of people. One asks 'what if' all the time but it certainly is a butterfly effect captured on film. It'll have you laughing crying and biting your lip. I loved every minute of it! And thank you SBS Australia for showing films that are truly entertaining even worth the effort to read the subtitles. The only downside to my mind is that I wont be booking a holiday to the Frozen Land - they all seem to be far too depressed - must be all that cold weather. Either way watch it - it's worth every second. ,pos
 This movie was on the pay channels today and I had nothing to do so I had it on. This has to be the worst football movie ever made. This has to be one of the worst movies period. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system and they gave 2 stars out of 4. This movie isn't even a half a star. Bad acting Scott Bakula sinks as usual Larry Miller?? Sinbad couldn't act if he tried. Rob Schneider's one liners completely stunk. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed that he was even in this movie. The only saving grace for this movie was the hope you would see Kathy Ireland nude in the shower not even close. A complete waste of time and of film. If we could give a negative number minus 9. ,neg
 I was under assumption that this was the cat and mouse duo but it wasn't instead it was something that shouldn't have been made not even for its time. They disguise themselves in the blackface fashion because they fly to Africa and they even act like Stepin Fetchit and all the others rolled into one. There are some cartoons that are racist but they are classics being a mixed woman I have the right to say this but if you are into the historical aspect of these cartoons try Merrie Melodies Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs or Angel Puss you won't find them on DVD because the distributors promised not to put them in the mainstream but you can find them on a site as YouTube. I don't recommend little kids seeing this but if you want to see how early America was racist and ignorant these are better suggestions not to mention this particular cartoon has poor animation i know it was 1932 but I have seen better for its time. Plane unnecessary. -1 out of 10. ,neg
 Great book poorly done movie. Cheesy performances and contrived situations make this movie a sentimental bore-fest. Flat and uninspired work from most of the actors leaves this film in the After School Special category. No doubt there is a lot of talent to be tapped in this cast and crew but something went horribly wrong The very talented Gretchen Mol attempts to pull this film out of the mire but even she can't seem to rise above the silly dialogue. Feels like everyone just phoned it in. Even the makeup (Mulrooney ages 20 years over the course of the film) looks amateurish and crude. Don't waste your time on this clunker.... go read the book. ,neg
 In 1984 The Karate Kid had some charm to it even if it was little more than a poor man's Rocky. Alas producer Jerry Weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the definitive low in the franchise yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential. What other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid? Wait a minute. Next? Yep Macchio's gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually) and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!) playing a troubled teenager (what else?) named Julie Pierce. Now the girl has family issues. She also gets in trouble at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). As it turns out though one of his students is actually a nice guy and Julie falls for him. This gets her in bigger trouble than before of course. Lucky for her she is currently living with Mr. Miyagi (Morita) an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys. All those factors ad up to seven clichés and that's just a generic plot summary - imagine what the detailed scenes must be like! From beginning to end The Next Karate Kid is a tired flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. Swank does thankfully have the likes of Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem this disaster but why did Morita accept to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first movie and was quite enjoyable in the sequels but has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the wax on wax off gag is stillborn. As for Ironside he is slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III but that's hardly a stretch. So is this picture really that awful? Not exactly. There is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of Asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest. ,neg
 In a phrase moral ambiguity. In the Soderbergh remake there ARE good guys and bad guys. Benicio del Toro's character is clearly the good guy morally clean and uncorruptable. His counterpart in the BBC original Fazal the farmer turned dealer is realistically flawed and conflicted over his fate. The two relentless cops are similarly different. In the American one they win our hearts. In the BBC original they are over-zealous nearly obsessive. The best moment for me in Soderbergh's was when the college student rhetorically asked the Drug Czar What would you do if you were poor and black and rich white people came into your neighborhood looking for drugs? That point was insinuated throughout the BBC show and crystallized in Jack Lithgow's final speech. Both are excellent but the BBC towers over the remake. My conclusion after seeing both shows is that dealers are innocent pawns who are only supplying a demand and it is the demand that causes so much suffering. ,pos
 This is the third Three Stooges short that the team ever made and like a lot of their early ones this is absolutely and totally hysterical! Now owning it on DVD as part of the Three Stooges Collection Vol. 1 whenever I feel like it I watch this! In this short film Moe Larry and Curly play these three doctors in a hospital who are trying to help out everyone but boy they end up making a mess out of everything! This short is another one of my all time favorite Three Stooges shorts I also am a very huge fan of slapstick comedy and the Three Stooges are the kings of slapstick! When I heard that it got nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Film I really became curious about this when I heard that it had lost I was very disappointed about it! This short is one of the Three Stooges funniest by far I extremely recommend that you see this hysterical riot! 10/10 ,pos
 This is unique in films of Hitchcock's that I've seen in that I didn't really enjoy it. In fact I actually found this quite predictable and annoying. Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a newly married couple. He's the kind of lovable rogue character that you've seen in many films without ever being lovable as far as I am concerned! In fact it was a barely believable relationship at best and at times seemed particularly false and implausible. Unable to hold down a job and trying to live an opulent lifestyle Grant is led to borrow money that he cannot pay back. Fontaine is convinced that he is trying to kill her in order to get the money she is insured for; and presumably what her late father was worth. Average and rather uninteresting all round actually but as usual you can see the influence on films that have come at a later date. ,neg
 Again I've read all of the comments posted here and agree with the many intelligent ones but totally disagree with those who think it was/is hokum. Personally I think nuclear is about the only energy left to us unless our governments (feds and states) increase the grants thinking homeowners will use photo-cells on their roofs. Many attractive and pricey homes in Southern Calfifornia are designed and built to take advantage of the cleanest energy around the sun. I live in a loft which is exposed to total sunlight on its roof the entire day. I hardly use the AC - I'm sure it would consume too much electricity to convert the intense heat in the attic to about five degrees cooler. We are blessed with dry heat in this part of the country. I'm from the Gulf Coast of the USA so I know about humidity....... That said I found the China Syndrome to be a convincing movie about what COULD go wrong if the industry is not busy regulating and inspecting nuclear plants. I think there are enough comments posted here to enlighten those who still fear it like the plague: they ARE safe. TMI is still on-line.... Director James Bridges carefully guides this plot (by Mike Gray-T S Cook) to build suspense and to a thoughtfully interesting film. All the roles were well-played: Jane Fonda ( Kimberly Wells ) Jack Lemmon (Jack Godell ) and producer Michael Douglas ( Richard Adams ) are all excellent in their roles plus all of the rest of the cast. I too loved there being no score. It was so interesting to get a true-to-life glimpse of the behind-the-scenes of the TV industry - that shouldn't be surprising. Currently Dan Rather is sue-ing CBS and I hope he wins. Can you believe Donald Trump saying he's a loser ? Trump - who cares? tiberius1234 posted a very good comment here - I agree. It is my opinion that getting vaporized by a nuclear spill is much better than living in a world which has been wasted and becomes Blade Runner and/or Solyent Green . Come away from your video-games for a couple of hours and watch this dated movie (really isn't) and get a little education on nuclear energy. I Recommend it to the whole family.... ,pos
 The premise is rather original and well thought-of but unfortunately siding a good story is very low budget that doesn't even allow for decent special effects. Jeff Fahey does his best amongst a poor cast as does the always beautiful Linda Hoffman. They should make more movies together. The movie while not worth much praise warrants at least one viewing. ,pos
 Hey; Belmondo! Look there's Anna Karina! Great American improvised New Wave (or Independent you want to call it that) not as good as Godard or Truffaut and not flawless but hey such realism style warmth and humor. I love that NY accent; you don't know nothing! ; forget about it . Just like the French New Wave it's about young people; partying falling in love or just hanging around. Lelia Goldoni is so cute; she's adorable; wonderful. Ben Carruthers' also good reminds me of Belmondo. A film you won't forget. A steady 26.5 out of 31 ;-) ,pos
 Froggie is upset that he never has a big party like all the other kids. Spanky and the gang seek to remedy that by giving him a surprise party. Unaware that all the decorations and preparations are for him Froggy sabotages everything only to find out too late that the party is for him. Okay Our Gang comedy works in fits and starts. The bits work but I don't think it really works as a whole. Part of the problem is that we all know where this is going and since much of the humor needs to have some form of surprise for it to work the whole thing falls down. I think in a weird way the film just sort of misses. Its the type of thing that had they actually thought about it might have amounted to something more than a misfire. Worth trying if you lower your expectations ,neg
 This film does not have the outstanding visuals that American Beauty or The Ice Storm offered and because it was made after those films it cannot be marked as very original either: the music though subtly brilliant sounds very much like that of American Beauty. The story has some similarities with The Ice Storm in particular (as well as Sigourney Weaver). Without intent perhaps the film seems to try to recreate the success of the two aforementioned movies too much. At times the story tends to stay a bit more shallow than it's bigger more successful brothers by having too much going on or by not delivering the most effective dialogs. Here the writing cannot measure with that of American Beauty. But that can be said about most movies ever made even the best and there is still a lot to like: said music score and (expectable given the cast) effective performances. Of note is Emile Hirsch who would shine a couple of years later in the outstanding Into The Wild . Overall I can recommend this film if you like suburban dramas though it's not the first one on a list of must-sees which would be topped by: 1 American beauty 2 The Ice Storm 3 Little Children. After you've seen and liked those check out this one. ,pos
 He seems to be a control freak. I have heard him comment on losing control of the show and tell another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule- no snakes. He needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame. The only reason I watch him is because he some some great guests and bands. I watched the Craig Ferguson show for a while but his show is even worse. He likes to bull sh** to burn time.I don't think either man has much of a future in late night talk shows. Daily also has the annoying habit of sticking his tongue out to lick his lips. He must do this at least 10 times a show. I do like the Joe Firstman band. Carson Daily needs to lighten up before it is too late. ,neg
