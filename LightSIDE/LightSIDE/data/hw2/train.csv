 I have never read the Bradbury novel that this movie is based on but from what I've gathered it will be interesting (when I finally do read it and I will). My comments will be based purely on the film. As soon as I saw the trailer I knew I had to see it and was so excited but when I finally did I was so disappointed it hurt. This is because the movie itself felt so amateurish. The actors were not well cast (though Robards and Pryce are both good actors - just not here). The kid actors it seemed were merely asked to show up get in the characters' clothes say the lines and make the faces. The set and props were cheap and unrealistic. The direction was surprisingly bad. I was so surprised at the awfulness of it that I had to go online and check who directed it just to see the kind of work he had done. The editing was cut and paste and the plot (screenplay) was just that as well (even though the author had been involved himself irony?). The building up of the tension fear and suspense was so mild it was ineffective when the climax finally came. I've read some of the comments on this movie and find it hard to believe people actually like it. What hurts the most is that the content is interesting and fun and intriguing. It had so much potential. Unfortunately the film was so technically bad it takes away from the brilliance of the story. ,neg
 What percentage of movies does a person go to see these days that leave them wondering what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: TOO MANY! This movie isn't like that. It is a story about real people that are sometimes a combination of both likable and unlikable. Downside: Not enough character development & some plot lines left twisting in the wind. Upside: Forces viewers to think about the choices they have made for good or bad in their own lives. Well acted by: Scott Cohen Judd Hirsch Susan Floyd Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. Contains some good lighthearted humor. ,pos
 It is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of Marxism from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge one still finds admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor. It just shows the moral depravity of Hollywood. In this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified. Needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. That both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship. ,neg
 This is by far my favorite film of all time. That's mainly because it's not afraid to delve into some very politically incorrect topics (such as spanking and female submissiveness) that other mainstream films are just too timid to touch. Nothing seems to be off-limits in this film as the director freely develops the story without any concern given to possibly offending the viewer. However I don't think anything was done here purely for shock value or to purposely offend anyone. Sean Young turns in an excellent and courageous performance. Most established mainstream actresses would not have taken on this role or would have asked for some major script changes before accepting it. The other cast members do a fine job as well. Have you noticed that this movie hasn't appeared on pay cable since an obligatory brief run a year after it hit the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit today's political atmosphere. It seems quite ironic to me that some premium channels now carry softcore porn (that's getting closer and closer to hardcore porn) but will not carry a mainstream movie like Love Crimes . Sadly even though this movie is only 11 years old it could probably not be made today. ,pos
 Yes this is one of the great musical movies I grew up with with such great entertainers as Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly not to mention the petite and glorious voice of Kathryn Grayson. The music and dancing is superb. I understand Frank took lessons from Kelly; and there is Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse which is quite unique for the time. Betty Garrett plays the waitress who falls in love with Sinatra. She is one of Hollywood's great underrated stars. I saw this again on A&E TV and as well have it in my old VCR tapes. Never get tired of these old musicals. Whatever happened to Hollywood?? ,pos
 I couldn't make sense of this film much of the time and neither could anyone else based on other reviews. The opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story. In it a photojournalist with a big mustache cancels his vacation to get away from his girlfriend. He is assigned to photograph a mountain range. It's rumored to be haunted but I couldn't tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in the film. On his way he meets a beautiful writer (Patty Shepard) and convinces her to join him on his working trip. Throughout the film there is this terrible music score mostly consisting of noisy singing that makes you want to scream SHUT UP ALREADY!!! What really will gall a person is that the film always seems like it's about to become good though it never does. There is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere. The inn and the silent abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous. The foggy nights look real not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set. And the idea while not original had potential. But it never does improve at least not enough to be worthwhile. Here's how it goes more or less. They stop at this inn run by a weird innkeeper (you expect him to be named Igor) with a hearing problem. There is a scene where the writer thinks a peeping tom is in her window but the scene is so dark I had no idea what was going on. Whether this was poor lighting or a poor film transfer is unknown to me. In any event we never find out know what happened. There is a scene where she wanders off during the night. Whether she is sleepwalking or mesmerized by the witches of the title is never explained. Another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen then found again with nothing stolen. They wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole inhabitant is this seemingly kindly old woman. There are other things including a chained wild man in a cave who is never explained an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way (will they kill her or brainwash her into joining them?) the witches themselves a bunch of brunette women in white robes who don't show up until the last 15 minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained. Even the closing scene doesn't make any sense. When all is said and done most people will be saying Huh?  ,neg
 This is in my opinion much better than either of the 2 1990's versions but is still not all that good. It feels dated probably because it is but it does stand up well compared to other BBC 1980's period pieces such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. The length of this adaptation allows for a much better adaptation of the book than either of the 2 90's versions and St John Rivers is at least covered although not very well. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester but the actress playing Jane is much too old. There is definitely scope for a TV adaptation of this length that has more than a tenner spent on it. ,pos
 The John Van Druten Broadway hit is brought to the screen with a maximum of star power in this romantic fantasy about a modern-day witch who beguiles a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart may get top billing but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most alluring witches ever to cast a spell on the movie screen. The lead pairing is in fact one of the movie's few weaknesses: the gray-haired Stewart seems a bit old for the role and while it is easy to see why he falls hard for Novak it's a little harder to understand what she finds attractive about him as they seem mismatched in temperment and outlook. (It is one of the story's amusing conceits that witches and warlocks are portrayed as Greenwich Village beatniks and bohemians.) Curiously the Stewart-Novak pairing would generate a lot more heat in Vertigo released the same year as this film but then Vertigo had a compelling suspense story and the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. The film's comic moments are mostly provided by the stellar supporting cast including a young Jack Lemmon (as Kim's warlock brother) Elsa Lanchester (their ditzy aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (!) as a befuddled writer. Hermione Gingold even shows up in a hilarious cameo as a sort of Grand Witch. There's lots to like in this movie--wit romance and a great cast--that is if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting Miss Novak. I have seen the movie a half a dozen times and I never can. ,pos
 Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources. To pick on the technical flaws - silver F/A-18s and F-14s take of from a carrier for an air-strike and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe which presumably is available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu. ,neg
 Kevin Spacey is very talented but unfortunately directing is not his forte. I had high expectations about the film before I rented it and maybe that is why I disliked it so much. I admire Spacey's attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting but it's not the attempt that counts. I found the film dull boring and stretched out. The acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better especially since he is conscious in most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing but this was one of his first films (I did get a kick out of how young and chubby this Scream star looked). The only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck. However that shot was very Usual Suspects ish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his (which is very good mind you). If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting watch Hitchcock's Lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming this. ,neg
 Bonanza had a great cast of wonderful actors. Lorne Greene Pernell Whitaker Michael Landon Dan Blocker and even Guy Williams (as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace Adam when he was leaving the series). The cast had chemistry and they seemed to genuinely like each other. That made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have. It also made many of their best stories into great western drama. Like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season there are bound to be some weak ones. However most of the time each episode had an interesting story some kind of conflict and a resolution that usually did not include violence. While Bonanza was a western the gunfighting was never featured as the main attraction. While I am a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead Or Alive; those shows usually ended with a gunfight. Gunfights were how many westerns resolved every conflict and Bonanza was very different in trying to seek peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of killing. In the early years of Bonanza there are some interesting episodes that do feature a lot of gunfights. Those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series but they are pretty good in and of themselves. In 1964 when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show Guy Williams was brought in to replace him. Williams was playing the role of a long-lost cousin. Unfortunately Whitaker decided to stay one more year and thus Williams was written out of the series when he moved away to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams had stayed on for the duration of Bonanza one can only wonder how much better the series would have been in the years after 1965 when Pernell Whitaker left the show. Undoubtedly once Pernell Whitaker left the series the stories focused more on comedy and country hijinks. Whitaker had often played the heavy in many episodes and his absence left a void in the cast. Little Joe always wanted to play the nice kid and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family that did not leave too much room for any gunfights. At some point they hired a ranch hand called Candy (David Canary) who became their fourth member of the cast but Candy was never featured in any gunfights and he was hardly more than an older version of Little Joe. For a year or two they also had Ben take in some other lost cousin (Jamie played by the forgettable Mitch Vogel) who was a teenager that was usually getting into some kind of trouble with someone. Apparently by adding the teenager the studio was looking to attract younger viewers. It also gave the writers a chance to write episodes about teenage problems alcohol delinquency etc. Those kind of preachy episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the establishment media to the counter-culture movement. Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order TV though Hawaii 5-0 The F.B.I. and many other shows also tried to jump on the bandwagon by doing TV shows that featured irresponsible teenagers causing mischief mayhem and crime. The addition of a teenager to the cast gave the Cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems but those episodes feel very contrived and are not very good in general. After Dan Blocker died the series limped along for another year or so before it was canceled. The last season was pretty bad as it featured Little Joe tracking down the killers of his wife and most of the episodes were somewhat depressing because Little Joe was usually drinking or otherwise remembering how much he loved his wife and how unfair it was that she was killed. I don't think I have ever seen the last episode of the series and I wonder if they ever officially wrapped it up in some way. By the last year there was only Ben (Lorne Greene) actually living on the Ponderosa as Adam had moved away (and never came back even once as a guest) and Hoss had died and Little Joe had left after his wife (in the series) had been killed by drifters. Overall the era from 1959-1965 is the best of this series. Once Adam left it slowly declined. Most of the shows before 1970 are pretty good too. By 1970 the series was trying to hard to be hip and topical and it had lost a lot of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenage kid also diluted the general quality of the show and the death of Hoss (Dan Blocker) was the final nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made and of the 465 episodes that were produced at least one hundred of them are excellent western drama! That is a pretty good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than a lot of other TV shows. ,pos
 Some films are so bad that they're good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story this film was about as true to the story as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible the direction was poor and it travelled way too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home. Nor did Melissa Joan Hart ever strike me as a talented actress but then every film she made was pretty low-budget anyway. Like most of her other films she lets down her characters by hamming them up too much talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic. She really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she's talking to a camera when she should be engaging the viewer in her character. It pretty much lets down the whole film and any leg that it may have had left to stand on is ruined. Probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end. But even that wasn't satisfying enough to subdue my loathing for such a bad film. Watch it if your taste in film is blander than a piece of dry toast. ,neg
 I contend that whoever is ultimately responsible for creating/approving the trailer for this movie has completely blundered. NO ONE I know wanted to see this movie based on the previews and EVERYONE who actually saw it (that I know) absolutely loved it... The advertising campaign is disgrace/disaster/blunder. Opened at #4 behind... #1-Rush Hour which I have not seen average IMDb score of 7.4. #2-The Bourn Ultimatum which I have seen awesome movie but 3rd week out average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving I would say). #3-The Simpsons Movie which I have seen okay movie but 4th week out average IMDb score of 8.1 (a bit high in my opinion). #4-Stardust average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower then Bourn but that's been our for 3 weeks). Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising I think that the powers that be behind this movie screwed up big time! This should have been advertised as an amazing movie that happens to be a fantasy/fairytale and not advertised as just another fairytaleÂ… Too bad :( Anyway- Now that I have very pointlessly ranted on-and-on... Awesome movie go see it! ,pos
 I am still shuddering at the thought of EVER seeing this movie again. I have seen action films I have even liked quite a few of them but this one goes over the top. Not only does it have the worst male actor ever (Sly Stallone) playing the lead role but the plot of the movie is so stupid from the beginning (why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with IQ less than his shoenumber to believe it. Furthermore the plot has no real twists at all a three year old kid could guess what comes next. It is a set of cliches (of action genre) with Sly performing even worse than his other movies (he was better even in Rambo III if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). Now there is an actor who can't act A) surprised B) sad C) anything else than his basic face. I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding but then... you can see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are magnificient but then... there are documentaries about the Alps and Himalayas so you can see better sights that way rather than waste time on this flick. Go watch some other movie instead there are hundreds even thousands better action movies. ,neg
 I don't know who to blame the timid writers or the clueless director. It seemed to be one of those movies where so much was paid to the stars (Angie Charlie Denise Rosanna and Jon) that there wasn't enough left to really make a movie. This could have been very entertaining but there was a veil of timidity even cowardice that hung over each scene. Since it got an R rating anyway why was the ubiquitous bubble bath scene shot with a 70-year-old woman and not Angie Harmon? Why does Sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTRESSES in the world? If they were only looking for laughs why not cast Whoopi Goldberg and Judy Tenuta instead? This was so predictable I was surprised to find that the director wasn't a five year old. What a waste not just for the viewers but for the actors as well. ,neg
 I'm sorry but I didn't like this doc very much. I can think of a million ways it could have been better. The people who made it obviously don't have much imagination. The interviews aren't very interesting and no real insight is offered. The footage isn't assembled in a very informative way either. It's too bad because this is a movie that really deserves spellbinding special features. One thing I'll say is that Isabella Rosselini gets more beautiful the older she gets. All considered this only gets a '4.' ,neg
 I was looking forward to Kathryn Bigelow's movie with great anticipation after the endless hype and 6 Oscars which it was awarded. Unfortunately it really isn't a good movie. The depiction of the situation certainly seemed to be accurate and believable on all counts but beyond that the story simply came across as incomplete and the direction of the movie appeared to be uncertain and haphazard. The actors put in a good effort but for me I didn't really get what the movie was trying to be. It's not as atmospheric and gripping as Full Metal Jacket not as epic as Band of Brothers not as action packed as...well anything. I certainly can't see why it was nominated for so much nor why people are 'hyping it up' to these epic proportions. Mind you given the calibre of movies in the last couple of years I suppose there's not a lot to choose from. ,neg
 Otto Preminger's noir classic works almost as a flip-side of LAURA...while that film was glitzy and features the high fa-luting Clifton Webb this film is a whole lot seamier. Dana Andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves. Preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked. Andrews is quite fine (a lot less wooden than he's been in the past) and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is stunningly beautiful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim. WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must see and a terrific companion-piece to Preminger's equally lurid WHIRLPOOL (also starring Tierney). ,pos
 If you loved Long Way Round you will enjoy this nearly as much. It is educational funny interesting and tense. Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates two tired mechanics two excellent cameramen and too much Russ. Ewan makes a few appearances but Charley really pulls it off alone. He is funny engaging and still a puddle of stress and doubt. Great stuff! The series wraps up in 7 episodes. Like LWR the preparation is nearly as interesting as the race. Though they cover the ins and outs of the race well there could be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing. It is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this. The series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths. Yikes. There is another extremely catchy theme song like LWR but this one is not nearly as good as the Stereophonics. If you live in the US god knows when it will be released so buy it on Amazon.uk and watch it on your computer as I did. Oh and be prepared to buy another motorbike. ,pos
 A response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed: One person suggested that the closing and destruction of the Ocean View Amusement Park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. This is simply not true. Prior to the construction of Interstate 64 which bypasses the Ocean View area the primary route for traffic went through the heart of Ocean View. Once the interstate was completed Ocean View rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. This led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park which also faced new competition from nearby Busch Gardens in Williamsburg. Meanwhile in the past few years the City of Norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought-after location for construction of high-end housing. It has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film Rollercoaster . This is also untrue. Footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to Death of Ocean View Park . As to the film itself the storyline of a supernatural force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly but somewhat typical for B-grade movies of the time. With the cast involved there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. I don't believe this film was intended to be another Citizen Kane ; I believe Playboy was experimenting with a new non-nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into (apparently not!). A strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table but proved unmanageable in execution. The roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway; let's come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise! . For the casual movie viewer this would be a see once and forget about it film (except for Diana Canova fans); but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park this movie is like a walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown Norfolk the first Harborfest and Old Dominion University. Even a limited release of this film on DVD would be welcome. ,neg
 I don't hand out ten star ratings easily. A movie really has to impress me and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that. Furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time. Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement. The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours. From the moment that the opening title appeared I knew we were in for a ride. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here once again: the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera. However for me that last one was never a problem. I think it adds to the suspense. I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD simply because it is genius. It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy. ,pos
 WHEN I first saw this film in London in 1958 I was bowled over. I had never seen a film like this before. It had a strange hypnotic effect quite unlike the films that I had seen previously and it left a lasting impact. I believe that Odile Versios & Marina Vlady are sisters if not twins. Certainly the interaction is amazing in its power to influence the viewer. If this has been converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language I would love to hear about it & where it can be purchased. ,pos
 I have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I never got the chance to meet him but I have never heard anybody say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not. I believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools. I also agree with other comments - what have I got to moan about? He took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour. God Bless. I couldn't watch the part that showed his dressings being changed. I have enough trouble with my son's. ,pos
 I have a severe problem with this show several actually. A simple list will suffice for now I'll go into more depth later on: superficial characters a laugh-track and boring humour. If you don't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show I didn't) to a frequently irked teen from Canada I'll summarize: Friends sucks not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the TV audiences for new good shows (Arrested Development Dexter etc.). Friends is as much to blame for reality TV Two And A Half Men and The King Of Queens as the television executives. Now then on with the review. These characters have no soul they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). They react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. Where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? Why isn't Rachel storming out on Monica after Monica starts hanging out with Rachel's enemy? Why doesn't Joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? Oh right cause he's the dumb one and he's comfortable with that. This is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility. The laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. Any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. How can I make such a broad generalization? When a show that claims to be comedy requires laughter from someone BESIDES THE AUDIENCE it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. Laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. Humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see The Office Arrested Development). This leads to my next point: the humour is boring. There is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. So what if Monica dated a 17 year old? She immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn't right and breaks up with him. There has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. Maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. That would be great it would be like a custody battle! So now I've provided evidence for my position. Many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching Curb Your Enthusiasm or Arrested Development. I have watched very little of Friends in my life but I have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show in my opinion completely unwatchable. If you've read this far thank you and I hope you at least start watching some of the shows I have mentioned. ,neg
 Awful! Absolutely awful! No plot no point no end. It looks like the director turned the camera on and then the whole crew went to lunch. Every day. I'm trying to GIVE this video away but no one will take it. I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 because I like Benigni. Roger I'm going to have to say thumbs down on this one. ,neg
 I read a couple of good reviews on this board for Mr. Scarface but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself the picture will probably make very little sense. Indeed after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of Rick's (Al Cliver) character. The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli) but as most other viewers commented he's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari's goons who chased Tony through the streets didn't actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them. For all of his buildup as the title character Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale making the U.S. working title Mr. Scarface rather moot. I've seen enough spaghetti Westerns to know that they don't all work; I guess in this case my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn't quite make it either. ,neg
 Description: Corny utterly stupid and worthless. It's so cheap and lame it'll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget (I'm guessing this...) probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie. It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater. I am giving you the best advice in the world: Spare yourself spare your time life and money by NOT--I repeat NOT even ponder about whether you should see this movie. This movie is so corny it'll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom. If you have a one-digit IQ then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable movie. You might actually admire it. (Like I said before IF you have a one-digit IQ) With about 12 actors of your own a few puppets you bought at a garage sale and of course cameras and music I gaurentee you'll make a slightly more entertaining home video than this piece of absolute crap. ,neg
 This film is really cool. every thing looks like it came out of the comic book. the sets the costumes and the plot is great. Clark Bartram is again our favorite batman. he looked a bit better in dead end but he still pulls it off. superman is great too. the flying effects are OK. but its a fan-film so we cant expect them to be the greatest. the shot with superman catching the car was VERY believable. it was cool. This is a movie i would definitely see if it were real. its got every thing you would want in a batman/ superman movie. one exception though i would cast the joker instead of 2-face..... overall i give this film a 10 because its a great film. ,pos
 Damn was that a lot to take in. I was pretty much mesmerised throughout. It was pretty perfect though I would say the editing had a lot to do with that. I can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them (Anton especially) to get all of this footage without any serious... beef. The Dandy's did come off well-together middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt. Great piece of film-making and great choice of subject(s). I recommend this to any music/film fan. You'll probably learn something about film-making. ,pos
 Given the title this first follow-up to QUARTET (1948) obviously reduces the number of W. Somerset Maugham stories which comprise the film. The author still turns up to introduce the episodes but thereâ€™s no epilogue this time around; by the way while the script of the original compendium gave sole credit to R.C. Sheriff here Maugham himself also lent a hand in the adaptation as well as Noel Langley (though itâ€™s unclear whether they contributed one segment each or else worked in unison). As can be expected much of the crew of QUARTET has been retained for the second installment â€“ though this also extends to at least three cast members namely Naunton Wayne Wilfrid Hyde-White and Felix Aylmer (the last two had bit parts in the episode from QUARTET entitled â€œThe Colonelâ€™s Ladyâ€?). While TRIO ultimately emerges to be a lesser achievement than its predecessor (slightly unbalanced by the third story which takes up more than half the running-time) itâ€™s still done with the utmost care acted with verve by a stellar cast and is solidly enjoyable into the bargain. â€œThe Vergerâ€? tells of a church sexton (James Hayter) â€“ for which the storyâ€™s title is another word â€“ whoâ€™s dismissed after 17 years of service by the new parish priest (Michael Hordern) simply because heâ€™s illiterate. Rather than rest on his laurels despite his age he not only takes a wife (his landlady played by Kathleen Harrison) but opens a tobacconist shop strategically placed in a lengthy stretch of road where no such service is offered â€“ and with business flourishing this is developed into a whole chain. The last scene then sees him pay a visit to bank manager Felix Aylmer who not only is surprised to learn of Hayterâ€™s lack of education but is prompted to ask him what his other interests were â€“ to which the wealthy (and respected) tobacconist replies with some measure of irony that he had the calling to be a verger! The second episode â€œMr. Know-Allâ€? is the shortest but also perhaps the most engaging: a voyage at sea is utterly beleaguered by the insufferable presence of a pompous young man (Nigel Patrick) British despite his foreign-sounding name of Kelada who professes to be an authority on virtually every subject under the sun. Naunton Wayne and Wilfrid Hyde-White are the two passengers who have to put up with him the most â€“ the latter because he shares a cabin with the man and the former in view of Patrickâ€™s attentions to his pretty wife (Anne Crawford). During a fancy-dress party however the passengers decide to enact their â€˜revengeâ€™ on Kelada by having one of them impersonate him (a jest which he naturally doesnâ€™t appreciate)!; still itâ€™s here that he contrives to show a decent side to his character â€“ told by Crawford that the necklace sheâ€™s wearing is an imitation Wayne challenges Patrick to name its priceâ€¦but the latter realizes immediately that itâ€™s the genuine article and that this would compromise Crawfordâ€™s position if he were to tell so Kelada allows himself to be publicly ridiculed rather than expose the fact that the woman probably has a secret admirer! As can also be deduced from the title â€œSanatoriumâ€? deals with the myriad patients at such a place â€“ run by Andre' Morell; the protagonist is a new intern Roland Culver who wistfully observes the various goings-on. The narrative in fact highlights in particular three separate strands of plot â€“ one humorous (the â€˜feudâ€™ between two aged Scots long resident at the sanatorium played by Finlay Currie and John Laurie) one melodramatic (the erratic relationship between disgruntled patient Raymond Huntley and long-suffering but devoted wife Betty Ann Davies) and one bittersweet (the romance between naÃ¯ve but charming Jean Simmons and dashing cad Michael Rennie which in spite of having pretty much everything against it including the fact that Morell has diagnosed Simmons as a â€˜liferâ€™ while Rennie only has a few years left to him leads the couple to the altar). ,pos
 A delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way. Cinema after all is a visual media and Igor used its full potential. A young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind. In one of the compartments he meets with a girl. Words are not exchanged but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations. The two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words. ,pos

 Well I have to say this movie was so bad that I would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work. ANd the worst part is I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over the city paid $10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does -- the only time I've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. Anyways the plot has potential -- it sounded great in the preview but it is filled with totally ridiculous predictable weak plot turn points. And I was hoping that this would be one Christmas movie where Christmas DIDN t have to be saved and that Santa didn't need a replacdmetn but nope. The only cool part was the sleigh rides and the little bladck kid was the best character. I'm sure this movie would be great for young kids but for adults it's so lame that it's chore to sit through. ,neg
 A masterful treatment of James Caine's The Postman Always Rings Twice as Luchino Visconti's first film shot primarily around Ferrara in a soulless war-torn Italy. The original negative was thought destroyed but Visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo-realist work today. A ruggedly handsome Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who had recently revealed her breasts in La Cena delle beffe (1941) star as the sensually-charged and ill-fated lovers who plot to kill her husband. Unusual ending in which although crime does not pay one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime. Excellent direction script acting and cinematography. Reportedly not as good as the French Le Dernier tournant' (1939) but probably better than the US version (1946) featuring Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles. Highly recommended. ,pos
 My one line summary should explain it all but I'll have a go at it. From the get-go this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera and that's about all I can comment on. There were a few interesting scenes such as the Big one that hit during the middle of the movie but wait what's that? The earthquake *gasp* wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well parts of it butchered and slapped in. I can't believe how poorly this movie was done borrowing scenes from other much better films. One wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown LA ala Dante's Peak. My advise forget the Bond Wanna-be Nash in this film and go for the real thing (again someone from Dante's Peak coincidentally.) ,neg
 Every year I watch hundreds of films including many low budget amateurish straight-to-DVD abominations that nobody in their right mind would ever want to see. I have seen thousands of films in my time many excellent many forgettable. Zombie Nation I will remember forever as one of the most hopelessly laughable 'horror' films I have ever seen Â– in fact I still haven't recovered from the experience of watching it. The day after it seems like some kind of weird dream. Did I really see what I thought I saw? Why do the police work out of a warehouse? Did the voodoo priestesses really recommend that the 'zombies' eat cheeseburgers? Is it safe? Is it safe? Is it safe? I wouldn't recommend Zombie Nation if you want to see a 'good' film and neither would I recommend it as 'so bad its good'. However if you are entertained by the prospect of watching probably the most indefensibly abysmal film ever Â– this is for you. Now whenever anyone asks me what the worst film I have ever seen is I will say Zombie Nation. Seriously Â– I think it's a greater crime to make a boring film than a bad one and Ulli Lommel deserves credit for producing a film that actually stuns you with its ineptitude. He really is the Ed Wood Jr. of the digital age and I for one can't wait to see if he makes another film as consistently ridiculous as this one. ,neg
 Blue monkey is actually mentioned in the film but not in any way that makes any possible sense. At one point some kids are wandering thru the deeper levels exploring. They begin to discuss what they'll find down there and one of them (a girl) says she bets they'll find a blue monkey. Yes thats it. Totally inconsequential to the story the only sad connection to the title and no idea why she would suppose she'd find a blue monkey in a hospital's basement. I'm embarrassed for having remembered it but somebody had to remember I suppose! ,neg
 Astronaut Steve West (Alex Rebar) and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn. His comrades are killed instantly but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones. Steve returns to Earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp; as he turns into a savage killer melting every step of the way he is tracked by his friend Dr. Ted Nelson (Burr DeBenning). This is often so uproariously funny - with enough absurd lines and situations to go around - that it's hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional. It seems to me to be kind of a goof on low-budget genre efforts from the '50's and 60's and as such it's a marvelously entertaining movie. That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious. We're even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn't really add anything but is still a gas to watch. Writer / director William Sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea; his ultra-slimy character is a memorable one indeed. I think his pacing is a little off; some scenes (like the one with the elderly couple) go on a little long but ultimately he delivers solid schlocky B-movie goods with a degree of panache. The climax is especially fun. Arlon Obers' music is enjoyably shuddery (yet also amusingly silly during some moments) and Willy Curtis's cinematography creates some really great shots at times. That brings me to Rick Bakers' fantastic and convincing makeup effects which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie right down to the ultimate final melt. Rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie (Sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running) and does what he has to do well enough. DeBenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero and Ann Sweeney isn't so hot either as his wife but Myron Healey Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are fine in support. It's also worth it to see folk like Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith (doing an appreciable topless shot) Janus Blythe (of Tobe Hoopers' Eaten Alive and Wes Cravens' The Hills Have Eyes ) and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit part. This is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore chills and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low-grade sci-fi / horror everywhere. 8/10 ,pos
 Steve Carpenter cannot make horror movies. First of all the casting was very wrong for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This movies has no gore(usually a key ingredient to a horror movie) no action no acting and no suspense(also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it's sad. There were a few parts that were supposed to be funny(continuing the teen horror/comedy movies) and no one laughed in the audience. I thought that this movie was rated R and I didn't pay attention and realized it had been changed to PG-13. Anyway see this movie if you liked I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. That's the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary. And seriously this is to you Steve Carpenter stop making horror movies. This movie makes Scream look like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. ,neg
 This budget-starved Italian action/sci-fi hybrid features David Warbeck as a Miami reporter who is chosen by the ghosts of the people of Atlantis (!) to stop an evil businessman (Academy Award nominee John Ireland) from using a telepathic fetus grown using spores from an asteroid to rule the world. You got all that? Despite such a loopy plot this is actually quite a bore and the RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS sneers at it with contempt. Honestly the most (intentionally) creative thing about this flick is the slight reworking of Herbie Hancock's BEVERLY HILLS COP theme for the opening titles. The most unintentionally creative bit involves a scene in a lab that is inexplicably shown twice back-to-back. Perhaps director Alberto De Martino wanted to get all avant garde on us in the twilight of his career? I was going to declare this Ireland's worst film on his resume but then I saw SATAN'S CHEERLEADERS was listed on there. I would also like to safely declare that I am probably the only person in the history of the world to do a double feature of this and Hitchcock's VERTIGO. ,neg
 Okay so someone somewhere a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies stowing away aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did. Someone somewhere was an idiot. I want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on. The graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me chills like a good rocket launch always does (my Popular Mechanics flying-car gearhead blood still runs strong) and the 3D was pretty effective. The CG wasn't Pixar-quality but it was generally good. The flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics with some half-assed late-60s characters thrown in for colour (hippie flies African-American flies with giant afros and black shades etc.) and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads (although they made suitably gross squelching noises). The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework relying on offensive and outdated clichÃ©s (60s gender politics including mostly-useless female characters racial stereotypes evil Russians a fat fly who only wants to eat grade-two level gross-out humour). In a movie aimed for IMAX they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel - they didn't get their physics right (zero-g in the Lunar Module during landing burn? PLEASE.) They couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts all of which is in the public domain; instead they wrote their own dialogue which sounds like crap. But we liked the maggots. So they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots. Uh yay. 1.5/5. ,neg
 My nose is bent slightly out of shape as I write this. I had sent a previous comment on this film some weeks ago that has not yet appeared so I assume it was rejected even though it met all the usual guidelines. I found this film interesting for the first thirty minutes particularly the performance of Jordi MollÃ  a veteran actor who has appeared in such major productions as Blow and The Alamo. Leonor Watling is also quite good. Unfortunately everything sinks eventually under the weight of a truly awful melodramatic script. There is also an abundance of gratuitous nudity that does nothing to advance the narrative or lend even an impressionistic nuance to what is otherwise a beautifully filmed piece of art. An actual day trip to the beach at Valencia would be much less arduous than having to encounter these fictional characters again anywhere anytime. ,neg
 For months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media so I patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about. After it was over I had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. It essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet) you cannot stand any of them. The film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric moronic and crude. The only slightly amusing character is Eric whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on. The final twist designed to make you laugh at the three main characters only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards Peet. All in all only rent if you are desperate or possess a dark sense of humor. ,neg
 Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are fine but what gives this neo-noir its juice is Hopper's creepy violent character and JT Walsh's sneakiness. A drifter gets mistaken for a hit-man and tries to make a little dough out of it but gets in over his head. I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie when Cage walks into a trailer in Wyoming to get drilling work with the help of his buddy...and the opening scene in Brokeback Mountain when the character does the same thing! But that's another story. Dennis Hopper is at his best here...cocky one-step-ahead villainous seething and explosively violent. JT Walsh (RIP) is also great as the man with a dark past trying to live legitimately (well almost). There are only 4 real characters of note here with the exception of the hard-working deputy in the town of Red Rock Wyoming. The first twist hits early on and from there it's a nice neo-noir adventure in some sleepy little town. Satisfying. 8 pts. ,pos
 Sadly the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at Universal Studios last week so we were stuck with video. That could even be a metaphor for this second-rate King Kong movie from Toho studios' stalwart director Ishiro Honda. Essentially it's a warm up for King Kong versus Godzilla . It even uses the idea of a Mecha-Kong like Mecha-Godzilla. Of course the movie climaxes with King Kong fighting Mecha-Kong on top of the expo tower in Tokyo but if you didn't know that already then maybe you're in the age group that this movie was intended for. The cast is headed by a guy named Rhodes Reason who we had never heard of... glancing over his list I see mostly a lot of scattered American TV credits so it's interesting that they dragged him all the way to Japan so that they could have a nominal American hero. The real hero of the movie is the more sensitive Japanese commander played by Akira Takarada who I recognized from Hiroshi Inagaki's iconic version of Chushingura (47 Ronin) and also from the original Godzilla films by Honda. I'm sorry Rhodes Reason whoever you are but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde played by Linda Miller. We laughed at the way Reason would always find a way to interject himself between Miller and Takarada who it seemed like she kind of preferred. Of course like all Kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the King himself. She discovers a nice trick: if you talk to a giant ape really..... really.... slowly..... he'll understand what you're saying. And if you're a blonde gal that means that he'll do whatever you tell him to do. That fact is not lost on Dr. Who (Eisei Amamoto) and Madame Piranha (Mie Hama) -- representing a nation which shall not be named -- who plan on using her as bait to get Kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the North Pole. Yes this is truly the plot of the whole movie -- apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons. Dr. Who builds Mecha-Kong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way so they decide to go for the real Kong. Kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with Mecha-Kong a story element that might have made the film more interesting but wasn't followed up on. By the end of the movie the cute blonde has shouted Kong or King Kong in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they're speaking for all of us. Basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the Kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early just like the newest version of the story. Kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously. It's a nice looking movie I'm sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways. The monsters don't ever really scare in these films they just jump around and push each other around a lot. It's not a worthless movie but it's extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy. ,neg
 Intrigued by the synopsis (every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign) I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it. This is my second (and I assure you it will be my last) purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video. As far as I am concerned this DVD is nothing but a blatant rip-off. I do not make this observation lightly Â– I am a major collector of videos gay and mainstream and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life. Period. My collection boasts over 1 600 films (93% on them on DVD) and of those well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed. I hardly own every gay movie ever made but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film. Sometimes this makes for a pleasant surprise - Aimee & Jaguar It's In The Water Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally. So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right one of my favorite subjects I decided to take the plunge sight unseen despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS. That film was pretty bad but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND. So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR? Plenty! To begin with the plot such as it was was totally ridiculous. This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right Â– we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls (like this even makes sense). The writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all and several plot points reflect no logic follow-up or connection to the story. Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist / right wing conflict on both sides and the acting is so bad that it's difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired. The characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting. This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves. The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue. Hardly a distinction since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is. It is an embarrassment to Queer culture and I intend to warn everyone I possibly can before they waste their money on it. At $9.95 this film would have been way overpriced; I understand that it's soon to be re-priced under $20 which is STILL highway robbery. I paid the original price of $29.95 and I never felt more cheated in my life. The only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews Â– I have seen user reviews for this film on numerous websites and there is always one or two that praise the director / writer / actor in such a way that it's obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this Ed Wood wannabe. How sad. How desperate. I just wish IMDb would allow you to assign zero stars - or even minus zero. If ever a film deserved it this is it. ,neg
 Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed. In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates in micro which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet (Stephen similarities with it are inevitable: recall as an example that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace). Bille August attends an exceptional cast in the Jeremy protruding Irons whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change. In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance with great wisdom Solomon describes in these words: The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you. Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint the tainted sister of Stephen whose sin driven by loneliness spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother. Meryl Streep also brilliant a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara. With telekinetic powers cognitive and mediumistic this hardened woman loyal to his blunt conservative husband is an indicator of character and self-control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings. Every character is a portrait of virtuosity (as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy ...) or a portrait of humiliation like Stephen Jr. the bastard child of Senator who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang. The film moves the bowels we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated but that absurdly still happen (Colombia is a sad example) and another reminder that against all life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August. ,pos

 I saw this film by chance on the small box. It has a fantastic and chilling scene about poisonous gas. A lot about fanatical patriotism. A bit of eroticism. I can't believe it's still waiting for 5 votes!! ,pos
 This movie does not rock as others have said. I found it really boring and silly. The story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer. The singer dies but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at of course midnight on Halloween (which would actually make it November 1st a much less potent date to be sure). The kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back-play messages. It also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world. The first part of this film is not a horror film at all but rather an After School Special. We see the metal kid (the outsider) tormented over and over by the popular kids. And he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies: When the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party DON'T GO! It is a trap. Especially if it is a pool party. Anybody surprised when he ends up in the water?? It was such an After School Special that I kept waiting for Melissa Sue Anderson to show up and teach Jody Foster a lesson. So back to the horror part of the film. So this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys (which would have made much more sense) he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm. What? A sensitive hero? What fun is that in a horror movie? Thank goodness Carrie White did not follow this lesson. He actually tries to PREVENT having the music played at the Halloween Dance the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him. If it were me I would have put that music on and pronto. The rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized. Why not partner with him and REALLY do some damage. Why you ask? It seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt..more appropriate for a Molly Ringwald film. Is this a horror film or an episode of Beauty and the Beast? The movie just goes on and on at this point with no scares horror or anything worth watching. If you went to high school in the late 80s like I did this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair but that is it for this film. Skip it and stay home and just listen to some KISS. ,neg
 From what I've read a lot of people were disappointed by this film compared to Part 1. Initially I could understand this but after a bit of thought I think they are wrong to be. Soderbergh continues his fact based telling of Che's life that he started in Part 1. Part 1 told a story of a revolution moving from unpromising beginnings to an ultimately successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from unpromising beginnings to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these 2 parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He bravely chooses to tell both in a fairly straightforward way. The viewer may feel a lot better coming out of the cinema after Part 1 than Part 2 but that is the reality of Che's life and not in my opinion any fault of the director. The film is far from perfect. It is probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war as the guerrillas had successes. In Part 2 they can't catch a break and we see their numbers constantly being reduced by death and capture. Che's capture and death are dealt with well. The film is greatly enhanced by the dialogue being in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentinian. So if you've seen Part 1 you will see a very similar telling of a very different story in Part 2. ,pos
 It utterly defeats me why Godard is taken so seriously - and One Plus One is a great example of his ineptitude as both a filmmaker and an 'intellectual' polemicist. It's hard to credit that Godard actually believed all that Marxist and Maoist kant. Anyone with half a brain could work out the bankruptcy of those 'isms' and how many people they had destroyed and were continuing to destroy even as Godard was making his films supporting them. As a filmmaker ask yourself: would you have boring voice-overs reading tedious political diatribes at your audience and then when you couldn't think of anything else to do layer another voice-over to the first voice-over which had lost its listeners after the first 100 words in any case? Brilliant Jean-Luc! As for Godard insisting on making a film with the Rolling Stones: of course he did; wouldn't you? It was the only guarantee of getting such mindless rubbish seen in the first place: the genius of the Stones eclipsing a talentless and babbling political idiot set loose with a camera. The bookshop scene wasn't worthy of even the worst fringe theatre and was an insult to the intelligence of even the young children who were used to play in it - as could be readily seen. Copping-out by allowing friendly critics to claim that all this artless crap was a satire on mainstream film-making is no more than a safe get-out to offer those who clearly see Godard's poverty of intellect and arrogant contempt for his audience. Ironic that Godard's one-time great friend Truffaut with Nuit Americain made the best film about film-making ever and Godard made the worst with Le Mepris! Incidentally Godard didn't choose the Stones' track of Sympathy With the Devil. It just happened to be the track they were working on when the 'film' started shooting at Barnes Olympic Studios. ,neg
 Principally it is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese revolution. It was easy to understand the contest but usually directors starts from a historical fact to speak about something else or they shows also the period before or after this fact here everything happen during that couple of days when the revolution acts. It could also be seen as a kind of documentary. The movie focalize to these two people showing as normal they were not like common heroes because the revolution come from people. Although it was made from military army from the title you can understand that they were just capitaes as the main characters. Nice colors and lights during the whole movie excellent work for the director being her first movie she doesn't fall to the banal way. Well shown emotions and passion of people and crowd. The character of Maia (main one)is well-made and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi able to show Maia's limits this not-being an hero. ,pos
 Michael Jackson would have claimed a spot for the top-billed character in THE GOLDEN CHILD and because he loves kids. That didn't work (and why should it?) so instead we have Eddie Murphy out to save the world by rescuing Kid Midas . I would strongly suggest all future scriptwriters to please thoroughly study the actor's inane dialogue in this quirky fantasy - adventure - comedy that's a step closer to ISHTAR. Whatever Murphy says or does can be best liked but don't get me wrong about his exquisite comical talent; he doesn't belong in this movie and the same went for DR. DOLITTLE! The violence and visuals combined are reasons to stamp it as a cult camp classic and that wouldn't have made any sense as Hollywood and movie fanatics kept cashing in on the guy. Speaking of visuals they were pulled off amazingly well at the time of Ronald Reagan's presidential fame. Murphy is far better at COMING TO AMERICA and 48 HRS but this stale movie isn't my touch of golden honey for a sweet crunchy taste. ,neg
 This film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments. I loved the character of Matt and also Tiny. They seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as is his no good cousin) and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy. I must say I saw striking similarities between Matt and another Aussie actor Eric Bana. My personal favourite part was the brothel scene loved that. Overall I liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating. The penalty however I was disappointed in. It was a side foot curl rather than the appropriate laces blast. I am of course kidding. :) ,pos
 I fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching Larry Sanders (I usually DirecTivo it but not last night). Woke up at 3am (invesment banker on the west coast) and was fascinated to see this on HBO2. I was shocked on how poor this 'movie' was. Seriously. shocked. So shocked that I had to write a commentary on iMDB. This is really really bad. the writing is boring but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school. Yes it is shot video. Mind you that is shot on VIDEO not DIGITAL VIDEO. It does look like a soap opera. The clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film' feel to them then this horror. I wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything. The shots and blocking are stupid. yes i chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional not daring not bold not boring just stupid. I know people reviewing this review will say well give me an example . I cant. It was 3am. but trust me I know you will watch it anyway you will be drawn by the horrible reviews. ,neg
 Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible. This new film is a mess. There was one other person in the audience when I saw it and she left about an hour into it. (I hope she demanded a refund.) The only reason I stayed through to the end was because I've never walked out of a movie. But I sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think they made a good film. The dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery. Ritchie took Lina's movie and turned it into another Blue Lagoon. This is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on Cinemax. Time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this. ,neg
 Too bad I really like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director failed to put this together. There's a lot of action a lot of promise but it all comes off hokey. The director didn't do his job. Promising action comes off lame. So much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of The Rage (DirecTV credits it as 1996) simply isn't worth the time to watch it. Another director would have done a better job. ,neg
 If movies like Ghoulies rip off Gremlins then Hobgoblins sinks to the new low of ripping off garbage like Ghoulies. These barely-animated furbies have some kind of scheme to fulfill fantasies (which involve basically groteque characters' sex dreams - oh joy) but what that has to do with anything is anybody's guess except to let the director indulge his kinky penchant for erotica. They show this down in the 8th circle of Hell one suspects. There's no real plot - just goblins - kill! and feeble attempts at humor and a mild attempt to arouse the viewing audience. ,neg
 Movies have put me to sleep before but no movie has ever done that twice so it took me three sittings actually to finish it. The dialog was bad. Women spoke stiltedly and the men were caricatures. And two of the supposedly Japanese women looked Chinese had Chinese names and spoke with clearly Chinese accents. I'm still trying to figure out why the Emmenthal men were sexually wrapped up with each other. 10 minus 8 1/2 equals a tough choice: Do I give this movie a rating of one? or two?

 ...and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way. First of all it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes. Your wildest imagination doesn't even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here. Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick disgusting offensive brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out. Now I love horror movies and I am very 'pro-violence' but I do think that it has to lead somewhere !! Is that too much to ask ? Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts. The movie contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story. This results in endless showing of torture murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common. Not very informative if you ask me. And yet - it has to be said - the basic plot idea surely HAS potential. It's about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial. Personally I think that is an interesting topic so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever. Secondly the whole production of this movie was a mess. They didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts...Tons of it !! The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I've ever seen. Any other special effects besides the make-up looks very amateurish ( Like that attempt to a realistic car crash for example ). There's no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere...not even an attempt to build up one. Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least. With the presence of death-metal icon Danni Filth ( from the band Cradle of filth..get the link ? ) this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial. Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this. And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing...Bah. I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind. For every self-respecting horror fan this movie is an insult. ,neg
 Confounding melodrama taken from a William Gibson story produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark heads up posh upscale rural nervous asylum where his loose wife battles with self-appointed queen bee Lillian Gish and Widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff-newcomer Lauren Bacall who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child. Facetious and muddled set in an indiscriminate time and place and with a David and Lisa love story hidden in the plush morass. Widmark and Bacall do have some good chemistry together but this script gives them nothing to build on. For precisely an hour most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library (this thread isn't used as symbolism rather it's a red herring in a non-mystery!). The picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when they're working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right but unfortunately the roundabout way Minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative enlightening nor entertaining. ** from **** ,neg
 i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan(releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture) it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences. I think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and David dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences.So it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction.Give us more of herapheri's and malamal weekly's rather than giving duds like garam masala! ,neg
 Since its release in 1983 A Christmas Story the Jean Shepherd-narrated story of his alter-ego Ralphie has become a true classic. My Summer Story however still has Shepherd as the narrator but it has absolutely none of the charm and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film. My Summer Story is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops. Charles Grodin who I normally like is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father (more aptly handled by Darren McGavin in the original) and his character never seems anything but forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute for Ralphie and the little brother is all but forgotten here. Only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on free dish night . The stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper-thin. May appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to A Christmas Story it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time. 2 out of 10. ,neg
 if you like gangster type of movies then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent Al Pacino his performance is top notch. and the story is classic!! 10 / 10 !!!! Why isn't this movie in the TOP 250 list?? ,pos
 Except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads this movie is really really bad. The cheap production values don't help. Of course you wouldn't really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn't keep trying to convince you they HAD a production values to begin with. Even for a B-movie genre freak like myself this movie really sucks. ,neg
 I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What a pile of steaming poo this movie is!! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can get my five dollars back???? Finally someone bumped Stop-loss from the 'Worst Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot. To be fair I don't think there are any good Iraq war movies anyway but this was REALLY bad. I won't get into any technical inaccuracies there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all. If the director bothered to consult even the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy however they could've made the movie somewhat realistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the credit for this waste of a film. He or she obviously hatched the plot for this movie from some vivid imagination not afflicted with the restraints of reality. Does anybody but me wonder what the point of this movie was? Was there a message? Seriously though.....WTF???? I'm pretty amazed at all the positive reviews really. This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring inaccuracies but even if one could overlook that the plot sucks characters are shallow (to say the least) and the acting is poor at best. It's ironic I suppose that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal because it's the biggest bomb I've seen this year. ,neg
 Intelligent wry and thrilling The Invisible Man stood out in 2000 among Sci-Fi's usual lineup balancing out Farscape 's fantastical art direction and sometimes melodramatic script with gritty cynical plots and modern noir dialogue. The show sat between Law and Order and Doctor Who on the believability meter but there was no denying the fact that I-Man 's characters went beyond caricature. Even characters that verged on predictability like the Keeper the Official and Eberts were given reprieves from the formulaic. Paul Ben-Victor and Vincent Ventresca had a chemistry that evolved and shifted elegantly made even more remarkable by the revolving door team of writers and directors. The effects are never allowed to overwhelm the plot and the science only sometimes verged on the totally unbelievable. The show's low points are still entertaining and I've never seen such taut pilot episodes. Matt Greenberg and Sci-Fi should be commended and fans have the right to demand a comprehensive DVD edition of the show. Every time I come across a marathon of Hercules: The Legendary Journeys on Sci-Fi I roll my eyes and sigh mourning the excitement and possibility of science fiction television that Invisible Man and its ilk represented. ,pos
 This movie was a real torture fest to sit through. Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self-evidently a 'bad thing' that it barely needs to convince the audience of it. When it does stoop to putting in its argument it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts ; all that's missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children! . While watching this movie I kept thinking where'd you hear that? or that can't possibly be true - yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources. And bless 'em the 'regular folks' in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power; to be fair that might be the fault of the film-makers but equally fairly it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars. As for the performers........... Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I've enjoyed and I'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause. But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the 60s have passed them by. Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor. Nash seems to be trying too hard - he looks like he can't possibly believe the things he's being told (not that I blame him) but desperate to feel noticed and included. James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever Stand and Fight in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine. In fact most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being patronizing. Nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesn't mean much to them at all. It's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall of the band Orleans and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the 70s. (Remember if you dare Dance With Me and Still the One .) It's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music. The cause is supposedly life-or-death but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they're playing the Catskills. Except maybe Gil-Scott Heron - his protest number We Almost Lost Detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the smugness of a high-schooler impressed with how 'controversial' he's being. Only Bruce Springsteen's performance raises a pulse; I've never been a big fan of the Boss but he absolutely smokes no question. Part of me thinks he was taped separately at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience. Compared to the general blandness and air of self-satisfaction here it's no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rock'n'roll. But even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting. I don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a '70s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by split-second cutaways to a back-up singer's tonsils. Now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with; and *maybe* the film-makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage - but all you have to do is watch Rust Never Sleeps or The Last Waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill. And with more exciting musicians. So really there's only two things to watch this movie for: Springsteen's stellar performance and as a sad snapshot about a counter-culture in decline. ,neg
 Rather nasty piece of business featuring Bela Lugosi as a mad scientist (with yes a Renfield-like assistant and his mother a dwarf and yes the scientist's wife (sounds like a Greenaway movie actually lol). Lugosi gives his wife injections from dead brides (why them? Who knows?) so that his wife can keep looking beautiful. He gets the brides after doing a pretty clever trick with some orchids that makes the brides collapse at the altar. After another bride bites the dust a newspaper reporter just HAPPENS to be around for the scoop and decides to snoop around for a story. She gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and Lugosi. Heaven knows where the police were. Soon she's off to Bela's lair when she meets a sort of strange looking doctor who may or may not be eeeevil. It all cumulates in a totally far-fetched plan to have a fake wedding to capture the mad scientist but it seems that the scientist has x-ray vision as he foils her plans Oh no! What will happen? I actually liked this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is great here his hangers-on are all very very strange the story is actually quite nasty in some places which makes it all most watchable. A fun little view. ,pos
 Magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain. PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess. A look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were. I just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused. I also think that Anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film. The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at. But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display. I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution. Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testament. I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and I'll be looking for the Soundtrack CD. In short a good movie to look at and listen to (the music that is) if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been ,neg
 A bit quirky and bordering bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching. A wheelchair-bound young woman Jane Hatchard(Helena Bonham Carter)is teamed with a reluctant caregiver Richard(Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist that daydreams of human flight. He builds an airplane in his garage and intends to fly it. He wants to resurrect his own troubled life by taking care of the independent dying Jane who suffers from an neurological disease that has all but left her speechless and very little motor skills. Wheelchair-bound and full of spirit her last dying wish is to loose her virginity. She offers herself to Richard who won't help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank in order to pay a gigolo to do the deed. I found this flick ambitious and humorous. Even in this role Carter has a certain charisma and likability. ,pos
 I have read over 100 of the Nancy Drew books and if you are not bright enough to catch on yet Nancy Drew the movie was of a YOUNGER Nancy Drew not the 18-year-old that doesn't go to school that all of the books are about. This was when she was sixteen. So naturally she would of not as been as smart as the one in the book considering she is only in the 10th grade. Other than that I thought the movie was very cute. It was clean and appropriate for everyone. It was funny at times. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulate in character and cute. I liked the awkwardness that Nancy and Ned had around each other because they obviously were not old enough to be in a serious relationship like they have in the books. It was a cute PG movie that I throughly enjoyed because I unlike most people my age enjoy movies without sex drugs or profanity. ,pos
 How Disney can you get? Preppy rich girls act like idiots buy a bunch of stuff and get taught a lesson. Is Disney trying to send a lesson to itself? That maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human? Whatever the psycho-analysis this movie sucked. The girls want a rich party for their rich lives. But then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant (yes milk) going to employ the workers. They keep it afloat until daddy comes home. And the man at the beginning who appears to be the one that takes the money is the one. But the ending is dumb. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Huh? Not worth my time ever again. But it is better than Howl's Moving Castle. D-  ,neg
 Interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity. The injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experience..A must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life. I am eagerly looking forward to your next product.Hope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Excellent work ......Joanne ,pos
 What was an exciting and fairly original series by Fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. During the first season Dark Angel was on my weekly must see list and not just because of Jessica Alba. Unfortunately the powers-that-be over at Fox decided that they needed to fine-tune the plotline. Within 3 episodes of the season opener they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see Jessica Alba!). I found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. The new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. On one of the second season episodes they even had Max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep. The moral of the story (the one that Hollywood never gets): If it works don't screw with it! azjazz ,neg
 Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who's been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands. The doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that'll return his lost memories if it works. But when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon he chooses to escape instead. While outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather (Greg Grunberg) mistreats his mother won't let her near the darkroom in his basement & acts suspicious in general. While the general 'mystery' of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it's revealed I found Mr. Diamond's acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout. (In the interest of full disclosure I've been a huge fan of his since Homicide and his brief but extremely pivotal role in The Shield up through Journeyman & Dollhouse) Not a great film nor a good one but serviceable enough. Although I did like it better than the previous films that I've seen from Director/writer Michael Hurst (Room 6 Pumkinhead 4 Mansquito) Eye Candy: one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination My Grade: C- ,neg
 La Teta y la Luna is a symbolic spain film. Everything that in this film occurs has a symbolic meaning. It is totally different to the usual movie that one has access. This film is good but it will be good only for the people who want look for the meaning of everything in the film's tale. I must advice that this is not a sample film. Please enjoy!!! ,pos
 Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka the main character is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way he finds changing his mischievous ways hard yet worthy of doing. Personally I found actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre that's the little flavor I meant. All in all I did not really care for this movie although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience. ,neg
 I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this God that and Christ is our saviour stuff. The movie and the story line did not need it. If as I am you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous. The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been. ,neg
 I saw Jack Frost for Â£4:00 at my local store and I thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so I bought it and I was right it was good. For starters this film is about a killer snowman so that's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the Snowman on the cover. The acting was okay and the lines Jack Frost said had me laughing I only axed you for a smoke and Worlds most pi**ed off snow cone how funny and camp is that? The tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack gouged eyes with candle sticks . If you're looking for a for a B-Movie Comedy horror that's full of puns then check Jack Frost out. 10/10 ,pos
 After having watched Guinea Pig two questions come in mind ( besides 'Am I really a psychopath to watch that ?' ) : 'Is it a snuff ?' The answer is no ; although it's the closest thing to a snuff movie I've ever seen. And then : 'Where the hell have they found that girl ?'. Because she gets tortured for '45 min without any reasons given ( in fact there is nothing else in this movie !) : Fingernails teared off beaten with hands feet tools infested by maggots ... and many more until the final scene ( I'm still not sure how they did that ). Because it belongs to the 'japonese underground scene' it's obvious she didn't get a lot of money. So what were her ( their ) motivations ? I saw it in japonese without subtitles but it's not a problem ( no real dialogues the boys are just insulting her in a few scenes ). I haven't seen yet all the serial but the first Guinea Pig is not known for being the best one. Still I've rated 8 because if the purpose was making people believe this a snuff the issue is quite good ( ask Charlie Sheen the actor ). But I think they could have gone further which they did in the following ones. Another movie I'm hiding from my parents. 8/10 ,pos
 This review may contain some SPOILERS. Just when you thought they didn't make them so extremely bad anymore along comes Rae Dawn Chong as a space vixen and Willie Nelson as a Native American witchdoctor! It's even worse when you factor in that these two are the BETTER aspects of `Starlight ' a film that should only be viewed for laughs. Chong is an alien sent to Earth to seek out the only remaining half-breed part man and part alien. Apparently the Earth is in dire straits. Something is wrong with the genetics of mankind and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland. Only by duplicating the DNA of the half-breed can the kindly alien race save the planet. Don't ask me how that is since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution which is caused by humans. You would think Earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures not saving them! Anyway the half-breed turns out to be Billy Wirth a man living in a small Southwestern town and is part Native American from his mother's line despite the fact that his mother is a red-headed Caucasian and his grandfather is Willie Nelson. Wasn't this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic Carmen Electra bomb `The Chosen One' such a howler? Chong arrives in her ship just as Wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend. Before you can say utter the word `hogwash ' Chong is revealing her secret to Wirth who isn't surprised for a moment and spreading the word to Wirth's family. Chong also makes pals with Wirth's mother who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years. Well this is because Wirth's father was an alien that abandoned her. Of course he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to Earth for Wirth so he can use Wirth's DNA to make the people of Earth his slaves. (Huh?) His laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture Wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie. Not only are they boring but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most. The ideas might be nice on paper but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien. But the effects are the bane of the movie. The opening scene involves Chong on her spaceship communicating with her superior someone who we do not see but that Chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light. They use no spoken words but telepathy so we are treated to subtitles. Trouble is both Chong and her superior's subtitles both look alike and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually `speaking' at any given moment which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish. The spaceship is the worst effect to come out of Hollywood this side of an Ed Wood film. Now I am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this but these effects really got to me. The most offensive was the most simple one: a fake night sky. The stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone. Most notably are the moments where Chong tells someone she comes from Pleiades and we get a shot of the seven stars. Thing is the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie but any stargazer knows that Pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations Perseus and Taurus and the cluster doesn't take up much room in the sky at all. These effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment. Be careful for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have Willie Nelson turn into a human spotlight and . . . Oh it has to be seen to be believed! Starlight star bright; Last star I see tonight; I wish I might I wish I may; not have to watch any more of this trash today. Zantara's score: 1 out of 10. ,neg
 I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me it is. I haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point but it never does. So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans. You could probably for it show up on television. ,neg
 I'll admit to being biased when I reviewed this since it was my introduction to the series. I saw this film for the first time in ~2005 on the late night Fear Friday on AMC which often pulls obscure gems like this out of cold storage for new generations. I made it a point to watch the entire Amicus anthology series before reviewing any of them here to make sure I had perspective. Looking back I still rate The House That Dripped Blood as my favorite followed closely by Tales From The Crypt and then Asylum. I think all of the elements that make this series charming---the vintage '60s/'70s style cinematography creepy to kooky far-fetched tales and the utter Britishness of it all right down the backing music----came together better here than any of the others overall. The movie centers around a very old English country house and the misfortune that befalls all that dwell within. The first story involves a horror writer and his wife who moved into this secluded place to get a break from the city so he could concentrate on his passion. He creates a murderous character called Dominic and soon starts experiencing great difficulty telling reality from fiction. There is a subtle physchedelia here via his torment that I found amusing yet creepy. Oh and those horrible prop teeth (then again these are British actors maybe those were REAL!!!) The second story is the tale of a lonely old man (Peter Cushing) that has moved here to escape his loneliness yet it only worsens as he is haunted by lost love. He seems to have found possible salvation at a local (very creepy) wax museum but it turns out he would have been much better off alone....... The third story includes the great Christopher Lee (my fav British horror actor) as a single father with a rather disturbed and thoroughly creepy young daughter. He is constantly wary of her getting into things she shouldn't---like witchcraft! She has a natural talent for it with good reason. Lee is superb here as the ice cold disciplinarian that man has a true talent for playing characters that are absolutely devoid of warmth!! But despite his best efforts the little troublemaker does in fact learn forbidden knowledge and bad things follow...... This final story is the tale of a cynical old veteran actor that feels the young director he's working with isn't qualified to capture a proper vampire film right down to the quality of the costumes and his cloak in particular. So he goes to a old curiosity store in the middle of a foggy night to get something more authentic . Little does he know that he picked up a truly authentic vampire's cloak! Putting it on at the stroke of midnight has rather noticeable effects. By the time I had gotten to this fourth and final story it was after 3 am and I couldn't quite stay awake on the first try (not from boredom). But I did experience something that I have hundreds of times a curious bonding experience I have with films or music when I drift in and out of sleep and the film/music becomes part of my dream!! Great fun!! This bizarre story was perfect for that and seemed much scarier the first time than it actually was because I woke up right when he was levitated by the cloak's power and couldn't quite comprehend was what happening at first. Not long after the lovely Ingrid Pitt a costar on his movie set came to visit and he warned her not to put on the cloak at midnight---but he needn't have bothered for she was a real vampire herself. The chintzy keyboard jingle that followed as she flew toward him on the staircase was simply hysterical!! And again in my half-asleep state seemed rather confusing! Side Note: Make sure to catch Lee and Pitt along with the stunning Amicus star Britt Ekland in the all time classic film The Wicker Man (1973). The weakest link here was the interlacing commentary between stories but based on the stories themselves this is a classic! Objectively I would say the third story is best but I like the 4th most because it makes me smile so much.Very highly recommended for horror fans and if you're a British horror fan it's mandatory! I'd say it's worthwhile to view the series in chronological order if you can. The last film of this series Monster Club (1980) is certainly the weakest. I think the first 3-4 films except for the at times mediocre Torture Garden (1967) are the best but if you like any of them you should watch them all at least once. You'll probably be back many more times to watch your favorites. ,pos
 It is difficult to find any positives in this movie. Seems as though the producer needed to make a buck without much effort & hence we are treated to a full showing of Galaxy which is the lamest excuse for a movie in history. The police girls looked extremely sexy in their little uniforms. More action shots of the two cops & a lot less of Galaxy would have been the way to go. Of course that would add to the budget so they decided to fill the space with that wretched rerun. Ms Albright does excellent looking sexy & her acting is first rate. Ms Stabs whom I had heard of but not seen on screen before also looked very desirable but seems to lack basic acting talent. Apart from Ms Albright this is real garbage. ,neg
 Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top notch cinema. This is as good a performance as he's ever given. Pacino is an American Olivier. And this is a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its inexorable effect on the people who think they're running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compelling --- the eulogy at the dead child's funeral is awesomely powerful --- the film has a fast paced gritty realism to it that enhances the fine performances without resorting to gimmicks. This outstanding portrait of big city politics also manages to provide two hours of superb movie watching without undue violence overheated sex or gutter language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A film like this restores my jaded faith in Hollywood. I don't award many tens. This one richly deserves it! ,pos
 Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man another noir-like film set among the rubble of postwar Europe. Like TTM there is much inventive camera work. There is an innocent American who gets emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't really understand and whose naivety is all the more striking in contrast with the natives. But I'd have to say that The Third Man has a more well-crafted storyline. Zentropa is a bit disjointed in this respect. Perhaps this is intentional: it is presented as a dream/nightmare and making it too coherent would spoil the effect. This movie is unrelentingly grim-- noir in more than one sense; one never sees the sun shine. Grim but intriguing and frightening. ,pos
 I'll just put it out here that was the Worst sequel to a classic Disney film I've EVER seen. In 1950 Disney released what I hail as one of his greatest films of all time. Now Take away the great songs add a poor plot that resembles that of a lost TV show. Put it together and what do you get? the biggest load of Crud I've ever seen. After i saw this I thought it was all over for Disney. Cinderella should've ended with and they lived happily ever after. not this garbage. This film did not deserve a sequel like this. I thought it would be like A twist in time which was moderate but better than this. Also What do we care of Anastasia? She switched sides like Iago did but it didn't help anyone. ,neg
 Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a wonderfully over-the-top Michael Caine) would kill for a hit play. Enter young wonder kid (a solid Reeve) who's just written such a play. Weave into this Bruhl's overly hysterical wife (superbly played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a very funny Irene Worth) and you've got yourself a wonderfully funny suspense flick. While not up to Sleuth standards Deathtrap is none the less a very capable twist filled comical suspense ride based on a terrific play by Ira Levin. The performers are obviously having a field day with the material with Caine in particular delivering top notch lines with gusto. The film loses a bit of steam midway through and the ending is a lot less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play but overall Deathtrap is solid well acted and suspenseful fun. ,pos
 It's not the most well made slasher movies of all time but for what it is it's pretty amusing. The plot is lame but the kills are not too bad. I have to be honest if you don't follow the bands that are featured in this film you wont find this film as funny as those who do. I knew someone who saw this film and was really disappointed because of the poor quality of the film but you have to understand that it was made in the spare time of being on tour in between playing to moshing kids and drinkin' with friends backstage...it's not made to be taken seriously. It's ubber cheese at it's punk best and with over 100 kills most of which are ultra gory it's a fun movie to have friends over to watch drink and be merry! ,neg
 I have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of Spirit. The best thing about the movie I think is that the animals isn't able to talk this makes the whole movie more honest and makes a better impression on both kids and the adults so 10/10 from the kids and me ,pos
 I think that the idea of the plot is perfect for exploring first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and second as someone else wrote in a comment the implications of this kind of relationships (incest and lesbianism) in the romanian society. so... to begin with the second aspect... to make it short it wasn't visible at all... as for the first.. as i said it had much more potential... i think that those kind of relationships carry much more tension... much more tension... and the potential tension didn't get through... i think the soundtrack could've been more than those few songs on the background and the theme (wich was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments)... yeah... i could feel the absence of a better soundtrack.. the actors... i think that they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10... not enough sensuality in the key moments... a total of 7/10.... mostly for the story ,pos
 A few years ago I added a comment to the IMDB on The Real McCoys TV series. I said then and repeat now it was a charming funny and entertaining show well-acted with wonderful characterizations. I recently saw on DVD four old episodes PLUS the Reunion of 2000 with Richard Crenna Kathy Nolan and Tony Martinez. As another writer here mentioned it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) weren't refered to but perhaps they can be tracked down via SAG or AFTRA. The reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show. One piece of inside information we did NOT get was whether or not Kathy Nolan regretted quitting the show in an unpleasant contract dispute which left Luke a widow in it's last year which wasn't very good. Nolan went on to do a bomb of a comedy called Broadside about women nurses in the Pacific in WW II. Get it? BROADside? No not funny. Unlike the sleazy salacious and violent TRASH on TV now that is so undermining our values The Real McCoys entertained with decent values and fine human beings. And I thank all involved including the creator Irving Pinkus for having brought it to my family. We never missed it. ,pos
 Unless you're twelve this movie really isn't worth it. It's obviously a low-budget film with B actors and with a genre like fantasy that sometimes requires intense CGI work that's not good. I knew it would be bad when I rented it. I enjoy laughing at bad movies. I didn't know how bad though. It's bearable until after hour 2 then it really starts to burn. Fighting styles go between normal fighting that obey the laws of physics and wire-fighting. There's no real explanation for the transitions. It has a plot but once again it's obviously a kid's movie. It seems like there are explicit moral lessons of the day that are being conveyed like Sesame Street or something. It's bearable. But much better if you're say nine. ,neg
 A different look at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting. However from my American perspective this movie just wasn't that good. The protagonist Marie played by Anastasia Hille wasn't a pleasant character and I had a hard time identifying with her. She was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left. Also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film. Then a long time passed before any real suspense built up. Once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot. All in all I'd recommend it for renting but not for theater goers. ,neg
 Bleak House is hands down the finest adaptation of a Charles Dickens Novel ever put on screen. Alway one of My favorite novels I was exteremely pleased with this Television Mini Series. The late great Denholm Elliot was perfectly cast as the noble John Jardyce and Diana Rigg was sheer perfection as the doomed Ladty Dedlock. The film captures the essence of Dickens era and is extremely faithful to the book oly making minor plot cuts that do not effect the story. over all a brilliant moving and atmosphereic film. ,pos
 This film is so much of a rip-off of the masterpeice demons and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. The acting is terrible the action scenes are speeded up the script is almost painful and budget non existent. If you think this film is good then you havn't seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons. ,neg
 this by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot. the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot. my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it. borrowing some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens doesn't result in a movie like them. if this going to be a top Korean movie I'd rather won't bother to see even a Korean movie trailer... By the way this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising. I think every Korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8 even though has no clue what it is about. ,neg
 From the decrepit ranks of the already over-saturated 'Hillybilly Horror' sub-genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks. Sound familiar? Well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre. There is absolutely new here. The film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichÃ©s (deformed hicks a peaceful family turned gun-toting killers when push comes to show the rebellious daughter the one 'freak' who's good at heart etcetera...) but does even that half-heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time. This is forgettable dreck but humorously enough lead J.D. Hart once starred in a movie called Films that Suck earlier in his career quite an ironic omen indeed. My Grade: D- ,neg
 Yowza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and feel good about it you're a better person than me! This movie while a great attempt at 'imitating' Laurel and Hardy through appearance sound and routine falls very short of honoring them or even being a movie of any substance. I blame Larry Harmon. Dialogue is torn from old L+H movies and planted in unrealistically the plot is muddled with useless characterization of the other needless co-stars Pinchot's accent was bizarre for Stan and while Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent he tried too hard to create the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. Where was a (good) musical number? Editing is choppy acting is stiff lines are horrid physics are -implausable- (although perhaps they were TRYING to give it that feel of cheap sets?) and overall it's a terrible thing to witness. It's even more painful to watch than ATOLL K where the legendary duo did their last film in awful 1950's era writing and photography. Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can and learn how things WERE. You know what a MAGNATE is don't you? Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence. I pity anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update/honor of the boys. Where was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG?!? Why ruin 'Here's another fine mess'? Why skip 'any the wiser'? Why was there a pointless gaggle of co-stars?! WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ???? WHY MUST LARRY HARMON BE IN IT? WHY BOZO!? And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help fund the thing? I mean really. Fart jokes for God's sake. FART JOKES. ,neg
 If you see this movie you know you will see an extense video-clip of popular music. But you will find more. Incredible FX great music and a nice time to enjoy with your kids. If you compare this movie you have to remember is a pop extravaganza. Clips of Man In The Mirror Leave Me Alone Smooth Criminal and Beatles' Come Together . ,pos
 Watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again. Even when you thought That mackerel surely can't be coming around again *slap* there it was. I'm not sure what they were thinking. This is the sort of pilot I watched and wondered Did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series? Not only black stereotypes but Swedish and Indian ones as well. And while Blazing Saddles made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness these stereotypes were just downright offensive. There was no plot line the ending was slapped on and the jokes aren't. Still if you are a student of comedy watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do. ,neg
 I'm sure this was one of those WOAH! attractions in 1982 when Epcot opened but now it's just silly. The film's message is clichÃ©. The Circle-Vision is disorienting. And that awful song at the end is grating. And I really wish they'd install seats. After so much walking all you want to do is sit down for a few minutes. And when you hear there's a film to see it sounds pretty glamorous! You get entertained while sitting down right? WRONG! You're standing there for 18+ minutes leaning against a short little railing. Disney should make a newer Maelstrom like attraction to liven things up and replace this dull lackluster film. NOT FUN. Skip it. In fact skip Canada altogether unless you're eating there. Move directly to the United Kingdom. ,neg
 AG was an excellent presentation of drama suspense and thriller that is so rare to American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many a viewer the willies. We rooted for Caleb as he strove to resist the overtures of Sheriff Lucas. We became engrossed and fearful upon learning of the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The manipulations which weekly gave cause to fear what Lucas would do next were truly surprising. This show lived up to the Gothic moniker in ways American entertainment has so seldom attempted much less mastered. The suits definitely made a big mistake in not supporting this show. This show puts shame to the current glut of reality shows- which are so less than satisfying viewing.The call for a DVD box set is well based. This show is quality viewing for a discerning market hungry for quality viewing. A public that is tiring of over-saturation of mind-numbing reality fare will welcome this gem of real storytelling. Bring on the DVD box set!! ,pos
 I was also on hand for the premiere in Toronto. This film was sort of a consolation when I thought I wouldn't be able to get in to see my first choice. Well I was totally blown away. By the time I got to the theater I could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes I actually forgot who was even in it.) Terrific performances from the entire cast. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her days as Trinity. As for Billy Connolly I think not since Chaplin has an actor played so brilliantly with no lines what-so-ever. The kids were also great. Definitely check this one out if you get the chance. And by the way I got to see my first choice anyway- and this was way better. ,pos
 This movie had potential but what makes it really bad is Lindsay Crouse's acting. I've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there that like her in something else but her performance in this movie is bad. Her delivery is robotic. When she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. So her voice has very little inflection. I can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. She has to know somebody in the biz. Now I hate to be this mean about her but the comment has to be this long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else. However I liked where the story was going so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. But the end was disappointing as well. Maybe if her acting had been better I would have liked it. ,neg
 Believe me I wanted to like Spirit . The idiotic comments people made at the time of its release about how quaint it was to see old-fashioned hand-drawn animation again as if the last pencil-animated cartoon had been released twenty years ago and the even more idiotic comments about how computers had now made the old techniques obsolete had got my blood up ... but then the insulting flavourless banality I had to endure in the first ten minutes of Spirit got my blood up even more. The character designs are generic the animation (partly as a result) merely competent the art direction as a whole so utterly boringly lacklustre that you wonder how it could have come about (we know from The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El-Dorado that there are talented artists at Dreamworks) and the sophisticated use of CGI is in every single instance ill-judged. (Why do they bother?) There's not a single thing worth LOOKING at. In an animated cartoon this is fatal. But it gets worse... The horses can't talk but they're far more anthropomorphised and unconvincing than the deer in Bambi which can. And it seems that in a way the horses CAN talk. Spirit himself delivers the prologue (sounding for all the world like a 21st-Century actor picked out of a shopping mall in California) and from then on his laid-back decidedly unhorselike narration is scarcely absent from the soundtrack although it never once tells us anything that we didn't already know or expresses a feeling which the artwork poor though it is wasn't capable of expressing twice as well. That prologue by the way: (a) contains information which Spirit we later discover had know way of knowing; (b) expresses ideas which Spirit would lack the power to express even if he COULD talk; (c) includes new age rubbish like This story may not be true but it's what I remember ; and (d) will give countless children (the production is pitched I presume at six-year-olds) the impression that horses are native to North America which is sort of true in that the common ancestor of domestic horses zebras etc. WAS native to North America - but all horse species on the continent had gone extinct long before the first humans arrived and the mustangs of Spirit's herd (which allegedly belong here like the buffalo grass ) were descended from horses introduced by Europeans. So the prologue rather annoyed me. As often as Spirit talks Bryan Adams sings sounding as usual as though he's got a bad throat infection - and it's not THAT he sings or even HOW he sings it's WHAT he sings: maudlin narrative ballads which contribute even less if possible than Spirit's spoken narrative and which sound as though they all have exactly the same tune (although I was paying close attention and was able to discern that they probably didn't). If only Bryan Adams and the guy-pretending-to-be-a-horse could have SHUT UP for a minute or two the movie might have been allowed to take its true form: mediocre and derivative rather than jaw-droppingly bad. ,neg
 I give this movie 3 out of 10 because I have watched zillions of movies and I can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like. Definitely The Broken is not one of those movies. I have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations I've read in prior comments they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people. the photo on the cover clearly shows that the Broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain. It's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless. So you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before. Though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue. Had the clues been planted more in the movie one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed. But though the movie was so slow in pace it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all. And the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil Gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments. Furthermore if Gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end then how come she is the evil one? I bet I can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion: This movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time. Obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all. I am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies. Horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages! They're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest I guess. Horror movies should have blood screams intensity skeletons body organs and parts. Because that is the real horror and it's never away from reality. I have watched almost all horror movies and I can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising. Nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of. For instance the horror movie Train with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with Hostel it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them. And even if we considered the Broken a movie that has an existential message it is still very poorly presented and the least scary. I prefer the addiction message presented in Requiem for a Dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex TV safety/being pampered etc... can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me. And those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils ecstasy leadership lessons (believe it or not!) entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life as ugly and scary as it may seems Death! ,neg
 Like most people I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film especially the film makers were then attacked aspect that the case seems to emphasize what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob. Then to watch the film and discover oh what they mean by the film makers were attacked was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said Someone should beat those two kids up. The picture on the cover the chase as it were? Total fabrication. Which I guess ties in with the theme of the film lying and manipulation to satisfy vain stupid children with more money and time then sense. I have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film. It's like Michael Moore's Roger & Me but if Roger & Me was Moore mocking the people of Flint. It's completely misdirected and totally inane. Wow! Can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of Communism would be really excited to have markets full of food? What jerks! And it's not so much Look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors it was that as many people in the film say the prices were absurdly low someone mentions that they should've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck. That's not proving anything except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low prices bravo fellas way to stick it to the people on the bottom. Way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people. You should be very proud. How about for your next movie you make a documentary about Iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say HAHA! NO SUCH HOUSE EXISTS! YOUR SO STUPID AND LOVED TO BE LIED TO BY THE MEDIA! . Morgan Please Like Me Spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it's no surprise since Spurlock as One Hit Wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him. Avoid like the plague. ,neg
 The quote I used for my summary occurs about halfway through THE GOOD EARTH as a captain of a Chinese revolutionary army (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to a mob for not having time to shoot MORE of the looters among them as his unit has just been called back to the front lines. Of course the next looter about to be found out and shot is the main character of the film the former kitchen slave girl O-Lan (for whose portrayal Luise Rainer now 99-years-old won her second consecutive best actress Oscar). The next scene finds O-Lan dutifully delivering her bag of looted jewels to her under-appreciative husband farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni) setting in motion that classic dichotomy of a man's upward financial mobility being the direct inverse of his moral decline. For a movie dealing with subject matter including slavery false accusations misogyny starvation home invasion eating family pets mental retardation infanticide exploited refugees riots civil war summary mass street executions bigamy child-beating adultery incest and insect plagues of biblical proportions THE GOOD EARTH is a surprisingly heart-warming movie. My parting thought is in the form of another classic quote from O-Lan herself (while putting the precious soup bone her son has just admitted stealing from an old woman back into the cooking pot after husband Wang Lung had angrily tossed it to the dirt floor on the other side of their hut): Meat is meat.  ,pos
 While this was a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action not animated version) I think it still fell a little short of what Disney could do. It was well-filmed the music was more suited to the action and the effects were better done (compared to 101). The acting was perhaps better but then the human characters were given far more appropriate roles in this sequel and Glenn Close is really not to be missed as in the first movie. She makes it shine. Her poor lackey and the overzealous furrier sidekicks are wonderful characters to play off of and they add to the spectacle Disney has given us. This is a great family film with little or no objectionable material and yet it remains fun and interesting for adults and children alike. It's bound to be a classic as so many Disney films are. Here's to hoping the third will be even better still- because you know they probably want to make one. ;) ,pos
 wow! this is a good movie! The acting wasn't good at all but if you look at some moments in the film rewind and watch it again it is genius! The man in the begin of the film walks with his suitcase against a three. WOW!I never expected that. Then he puts the coke in a suitcase and runs away. I bet that smoking guy against that three was one of his mates who sold the drugs later. And the genius quotes: ''nice shades i need a pair'' ''their yours.. if you think you can take them..''.. just Brilliant! And the fighting is the best i've seen in a while. Look at the second guy he takes down after he hit the head of the first guy against the table. WHAT A HIT! And in the middle of the film one guy in a car shot one time then 3 guys fall he is really good at aiming. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant it was so exciting that james cahill walks 5 minutes up and down the stairs and shoot jason peters after his distraction moves. Jason Peters falls down and roll over again while he is dead! I can't say with more words how great this movie is! ,pos
 The first and only time I saw the woman in black was I think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on TV back in 1989. It was Christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church. I was quite young at the time but i'm not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father!. There are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think 0ne of them is the fact that there's not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every Hollywood movie so every creak thump and bang is more amplified in your head as there's no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there's no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on. This is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door! A superb ghost story I've never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on TV i cant believe the BBC has deleted it after (to my knowledge) only one showing! ,pos
 Olivier Kosentsev Richardson Coranado Zefferelli and Almerayeda have all directed Hamlet but Branagh's the only one who got it right. This is the only film of Hamlet that contains the full four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story. Not many directors could pull this off without boring their audience but Branagh's skillful use of bravora film style and stunt casting allows people to see the importance of the scenes that are usually cut out. Examples of this include Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo whos entire purpose in the film was to simply say yes my lord as Polonius asks him to spy on Leartes. This also included Billy Crystal as the grave digger Robin Williams as Osric Jack Lemmon as Marcellous and Charlton Heston as the actor. Branagh's performance of the Act 4 scene 4 soliloquy (Which again is usually cut out) is nothing short of c cinematic marvel as the camera slowly pulls back as the intensity grows. It is a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding. Branagh is the only film maker that understood the importance of every scene in this film and knew how to convey that importance to the general audience. This is a must see for everyone who enjoy's good story telling brilliant acting and incredible direction. All of these part of William Shakespeares greatest triumph. ,pos
 This could have been a rather entertaining film but instead it ranks with other duds like Leeches and Rest In Pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain. Had they played this flick tongue-in-cheek it could have been a very entertaining film like Re-Animator or Dead ALive but Juan Piquor Simon plays it tongue-in-cheek in spots but straight more often. The premise of this film is a small community that is besieged by mutated slugs. There is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a sewer line that mutates the slugs into aggressive meat-eating monsters - albeit monsters that move slowly and can be squished under your boot. Health Inspector Michael Garfiled and two accomplices are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy. The climax is a laugh riot - unintentional at that - which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid (actors and screenwriter) the scenario of destroying the slugs is. STORY: $$ (No new ground charted here. Simon seems to play the gore elements tongue-in-cheek but the dialogue is straight. Had Simon worked with a clever script - one with plenty of one-liners and eccentric characters this could have been a cult film). VIOLENCE: $$$ (You won't be letdown here. We get plenty of exploding chest cavity scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine Italian restaurant. The blood and guts that many horror film watchers enjoy is in full swing here. You also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug smashing scenes). ACTING: $ (Wow! Michael Garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film-making endeavor is. Kim Terry as his wife does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold-your-face-while-you-scream bit. The teenagers were all horrible actors - no exceptions. Man this film could have used Bruce Dern or Jeffrey Combs!) NUDITY: $$ (Two teens get naughty in bed before they get dispatched - in a poorly done scene - by a horde of slugs that crawled into the girl's bedroom. Both male and female nudity here). ,neg
 This movie is a lot like the movie Hostel except with *BAD* acting and not much suspense. The gore elements are there but you don't really feel anything for the characters making the violence not very effective. Some parts are just strange... like forcing a snake down someones throat. What's up with that? Is that supposed to be scary or gory? It's just kind of stupid. As for torture there really isn't any (except for the guy getting blow-torched in the beginning which they don't show anyway). The main bad guy keeps saying make them die slowly yet the butcher kills them all very fast. The deaths are all relatively quick. Yes I did watch the unrated version. So overall not the worst gore movie I've seen but not at all good either. You won't miss anything if you skip this one. ,neg
 Shinobi is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story. Unfortunately for the audience to actually care about the people dying you have to develop the characters otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters all of whom die. OK so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible right? Nope. Here we have a war between two ninja clans with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain dumb. Fine fine! There is no character development and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes right? Yet again NO! In fact many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly (and lamely in my opinion). I'm talking about things like Lalala I'm walking along and I- *neck gets slashed*. THE END for that character. Not even halfway through the film I threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it. ,neg
 I wasn't alive in the 60's so I can't guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience. There are some excellent performances most notably by Josh Hamilton (of With Honors) Jerry O'Connell (Sliders) who play brothers divided by the war. Bill Smitrovich a character actor who has been long ignored by many gives a heart-filled performance as their strict father who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Vietnam but returns empty inside while the other is exactly the opposite. All in all this is a powerful and heartwarming film that I hope everyone gets a chance to experience. ,pos
 Interesting characters lots of tension. As close to black and white without being black and white. I was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character a quiet near deaf secretary was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get-away. I'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks. In this film we never know who's money it really is they abscond with or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot. Too bad the film could have been great. ,pos
 I enjoyed this movie. Haven't seen Andy Griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly. I've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he's versatile. I wasn't troubled that Dotty's anxiety disorder may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook. There are zillions of whatever-phobias and neuroses and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly a sensitive with extra-sensory powers as was understood by the local Indians but not by any Anglos. It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. Although this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems. Also Hiram's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle. It's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance. ,pos
 I've seen a lot of TV movies in my time as a student the majority the normal waste of time that US television throws out. This one however was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end. Having only seen Richard Dean Anderson in MacGyver and Stargate I was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from A-B that he normally gives. It was a pleasant surprise to see Daphne Zuniga after quite a long time dating back to The Fly II. Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme in a leading role again. I can't say that I ever take Jane Leeves seriously after her Benny Hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role. All in all a highly recommended film. ,pos
 I still don't know why I forced myself to sit through the whole thing. This film wasn't worth the Memorex DVD-R it was burned on; I thought I was watching the end result of a group of middle schoolers stealing their parents' camcorder. This is by far the worst movie ever made. I truly from the bottom of my heart want to sue Aaron Yamasato for the two hours he stole from my life. So apparently it's supposed to be bad on purpose; However if you should end up in Hell and are forced to watch this 90-minute coil of doo-doo you'll see that Yamasato is really trying hard to make an awesome flick. The actors attempt dramatic kick-ass performances comparable to Crimson Tide but come closer to The Marine. The crap acting is just the tip of the iceberg. The camera angles are awful. The story is C-movie at best-- the plot isn't even good enough to be considered B-movie caliber. The dialogue attempts to be dynamic and witty but is crap like everything else. Rumor has it that a hard copy of the screenplay actually attracts flies. Plus the techno score is annoying... not because it's techno but because it's NON-STOP. That's right the music plays in the background THE WHOLE TIME acting as a subliminal reminder of how bad this thing is. I don't care what the disclaimer claims I don't buy it. BOTS was not made this bad on purpose because it takes itself WAY too serious for what it was: a joke. This film was very low-budget. But that is no excuse for its record-setting suck factor. Great films are born of substance not budget. BOTS had neither. Allow me to further articulate the overwhelming power of this 90-minute waste of time: if I were having a three-way with Jessica Alba and Jessica Biel in front of a TV and Blood of the Samurai came on I'd be out of there quicker than Steven Seagal in Executive Decision. Undoubtedly some people will try to defend the movie. Two maybe three. They'll say it's grindhouse chop-socky! or cheesy in a good way! or it's so bad it's good! Those people are idiots. A movie is either good or it's bad. There's no such thing as a good bad movie. But there ARE such things as idiots that like crappy movies. Don't get me wrong; there are lots of cornball not-to-be-taken-seriously movies out there that are enjoyable and entertaining. Slither is one. BOTS is not. This suckfest runs about an hour and a half and in my humble opinion it's 90 minutes too long. The best thing about this film is the DVD cover so next time you're near the Wal-Mart DVD bargain bin take a look at it-- DON'T TOUCH IT just look-- and quietly walk away. ,neg
 i think that new york is a big fake i mean her whole guidelines of this show is stupid. i enjoyed flavor fl av more better she acts like a slut and a hoe put together. her mother is out of this world i think she is the devils daughter. i mean what does she think she is doing these men already have girls and i believe once you have been with her you will be to ashamed to go back to your girl. she is nasty spoiled and a big fat fake.the show is very interesting to watch how much money is she getting to do this awful show and whats up with her mother i thought her and new york did not get along but now it seems as though she is just as fake as her crazy daughter.and where is the so called husband he is no where to be found i would not to be with them either. ,neg
 CAT SOUP is a short anime based on the legendary manga Nekojiru. It won the award Best Short Film at The 6th Fantasia Film Festival and also won the Excellence Prize at Japan's Media Arts Festival. When little kitten Nyaako's soul is stolen by Death she and her brother Nyatta embark on a bizarre journey to get it back. In the surreal dreamscape of the Other Side they encounter many fantastic characters and remarkable often disturbing adventures. CAT SOUP is an anime like nothing you've ever seen. It's Hello Kitty on acid! It is very original stunningly beautiful and possess a great sense of strangeness and lyricism. CAT SOUP is very surrealistic (there are no dialogue) and sometimes cruel and gory. So it is more an anime for adults than children (they may not understand at all!). A great journey for those who get the chance to see this absolute masterpiece. An must-see! ,pos
 I know some people think the movie is boring but I disagree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I liked the characters in the film and think that leaving parts of Archie's life a mystery captured his humanity. I don't think the purpose of a good biography should be the detailing of someone's life but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. And what is more fascinating than someone so successfully reinventing themselves? Men become what they dream - you have dreamed well. Good job to Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really stood out to me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more films. ,pos
 Of course the story line for this movie isn't the best but the dances are wonderful. This story line is different from other Astaire-Rogers movies in that neither one is chasing the other. The dancing of Fred and Ginger is what makes this movie. ,pos
 I am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this! I haven't seen such a bad movie for years.Omg this was a really bad movie. Splatter is not enough to describe the unnecessary (nearly funny) blood scenes). If you didn't like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ..well this is 10 time worse. The story remind me RL Stine goosebumps.! I can't tell about the acting since the script was so terrible.ClichÃ© all the time. (why i must write 10lines? i never understood this.) ==Here comes spoilers== The story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro. We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice. Actually those people are just missing. And There is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery (well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy) and as usual no one believes him! what a surprise! In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher! ,neg
 The first Cube movie was an art movie. It set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn't understand. It was on the non-literal level a man vs. cruel nature plot where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end triumphing to face a new indefinable world beyond man's petty squabbles; a world where there were no more struggle but peace. I rated Cube a 10 out of 10 and it's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels. The second movie Hypercube was a massive disappointment. Some of the ideas were kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. Still for being fairly entertaining I rated it a 5 out of 10. The third movie Cube Zero while ignoring the second plays like a vastly inferior commercial B-movie rehash of the first sans the symbolism. There is no homage or tribute here; there is only ripping off. The same kind of plot with some elements idiotically altered (like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip-off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say). That we see something from behind the scenes means nothing because the watchers are just part of the Big Bad Experiment the architects of which we hear nothing of. And in this movie those who get through to the exit (like Kazan did at the end of the first movie) are just killed - where the *bleep* is the sense in that?! That's just flippin' stupid. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this. The production values and acting in Cube Zero are not too bad but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10. ,neg
 John Carradine John Ireland and Faith Domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this Grade G horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion. For Carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in. With that magnificent sonorous voice of his Carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in. He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion who movie director John Ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film. It's even got a graveyard but with a missing occupant. Faith Domergue is Ireland's aging star and Carole Wells is the young ingenue. In the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already. The script is so incoherent I'm still trying to figure out the point. I won't waste any more gray matter on it. ,neg
 The plot sounded like it had promise. To be honest I did not watch the entire movie. After about an hour into the movie I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth watching until it conclusion? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. Nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human / wolf transplant. It was because the movie was badly written acting lacked emotion and I did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes. When he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying If you can't run with the big dogs don't leave the porch kept running through my bored mind. Save yourself the time and skip this movie. I can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as I did wondering why anyone waste money time energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to American cinema. ,neg
 Without wishing to be a killjoy Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two of the most dull and clichÃ©d films i've ever seen - this being one of them and Camp Blood being another. The acting is terrible the print is shoddy and everything about this film screams seriously you could do better yourself . Maybe this is a challenge to everyone to saturate youtube with our own zombie related crap? I bought this for Â£1 but remember you can't put a price on 71 minutes of your life. You'd do well to avoid this turkey even at a bargain basement price. ,neg
 I don't know about you but what I love about Tom and Jerry cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. Mouse In Manhattan sees Jerry leaving Tom behind to have an adventure in New York and as far as I am concerned this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat! As magical as Jerry's exploration of the 'Big Apple' might be for the other T&J fans who have commented here on IMDb I couldn't wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to end so I could watch the next cartoon on my DVD. In fact the only part of the whole episode that I genuinely enjoyed was when Jerry almost 'buys the farm' hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle hundreds of feet above a busy road. ,neg
 It's not so much that SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION had little potential. Indeed the under-explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and for at least the opening half this Tobe Hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy '90s horror can. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's on-again-off-again performance and the overly intricate plot this would-be thriller loses its way. Dourif featured here before his built-in horror fan base had accumulated is average guy Sam. Of course average guys don't stay average for long in horror movies so after a well-done origin outline we see Sam's various body parts start to ignite. Soon he's igniting other people too much to the consternation of gal pal Lisa played unmemorably by Cynthia Bain. While the title of the film implies a fire-happy monster on the loose director Hooper opted to make Sam an unwilling killer. This approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack but it also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower. We're left wondering whether this would have worked better as a straight-up villain-versus-everyone effort ala NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is a pretty nominal effort when all is said and done. It will carry added appeal for Dourif's fans and those who can't get enough 1990s horror be it good bad or in between but only on a slow night. ,neg
 I can agree with other comments that there wasn't an enormous amount of history discussed in the movie but it wasn't a documentary! It was meant to entertain and I think it did a very good job at it. I agree with the black family. The scenes with them seemed out of place. Like all of a sudden it would be thrown in but I did catch on to the story and the connection between the families later on and found it pretty good. Despite it wasn't a re-enactment of the 60s it did bring into the light very big and important landmark periods of the decade. I found it very entertaining and worth my while to watch. ,pos
 I'll keep this one quite short. I believe that this is an extraordinary movie. I see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that it's badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that it's not real in its portrayal of life. OK so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed. Hope that it isn't too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives. Gangland violence is real right? Is it right no! This movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than denigrated. I have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving (well not until 2008 anyway). 9 out of 10 from me for this one. It's very nearly perfect in my view. JMV ,pos
 This third Pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too repetitious to entertain older kids. The message of the film-- about dealing with loss-- is subverted by the return of the young girl's father during the film's credits. Team Rocket provide some amusement but they're not really part of the small plot so they don't appear very often. ,neg
 I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my Horror this movie was the worst movie I had ever seen! I read the comment from Gumby-8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all. I couldn't believe Gumby-8's comments. Quoting: From the Dune inspired opening animation to the quick pace...this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected. The Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving well that's because you keep looking for any type of suspense. I mean give me a break Halloween was shot with a budget of $100 000.00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic. As far as repeat viewing is not unexpected I think he made a typo. Another quote from Gumby-8 the only Fan: The acting is also a strong aspect of the film. With all due respect for the actors their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton. The catchy Tagline: Beware the hour between dusk and darkness That's because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie. MPAA rating Rated R for some violence/gore The only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see. As far as I know it might be a clump of grass. In summation I have seen horror flicks from the 50's 60's and 70's. I have seen what I thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good. The director of this film either did not make any attempt was asleep or took a hit of acid. Whatever the case I think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction. I would give this film a rating of .5 for a 'B' movie. ,neg
 The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is bad film in every way. The script the dreary pace the lack of depth in any character the pointless sub-plots the dreadful acting the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I found nothing likable enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way. I imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark with its moody lighting long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack. If so they failed utterly. It just bored me and I wish I had never watched it. Avoid at all costs. ,neg
 I cringed all the way through this movie. First of all the idiotic plot has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood has attempted to create a kind of comedy car chase movie. Imagine Englebert Sings Hendrix . Do not take anything about this movie to be accurate. The name Parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as springboard for a low budget chase movie a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the Parsons legacy and his fan base. Gram's father had long since been dead in 1973 the other global characters are fictional none of this has anything to do with Grams life or death. If you are a Gram fan I advise you to not see this movie. I wish I hadn't. It's saddening to see something special be treated as such disgracing fodder. I'd swear I could hear Gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and legacy do not take anything in this movie as being representative of Gram. I cannot say enough bad things about this movie. If Gram were alive and saw this movie he would kill himself. Then again maybe he'd be afraid to if he knew this movie were to result. ,neg
 Canadian filmmaker Mary Harron is a cultural gadfly whose previous films laid bare some the artistic excess of the Sixties and the hollow avaricious Eighties. With The Notorious Bettie Page she points her unswerving eye at Fifties America an era cloaked in the moral righteousness of Joe McCarthy while experiencing the beginnings of a sexual awakening that would result in the free love of the next decade. Harron and her co-writer Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopic of a sex symbol. This is a film about the underground icon of an era and how her pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predatory instincts and impure thoughts of a culture untouched by the beauty of a nude body. If the details of Bettie's life were all the film was concerned about then why end it before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly Harron is more interested in America's attitudes towards sexual imagery then and now. Together with a fearless lead performance by Gretchen Mol and the stunningly atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III she accomplishes this goal admirably holding up a mirror to the past while making the audience examine their own enlightened 21st Century attitudes towards so-called pornography. As America suffocates under a new conservatism this is a film needed more than ever. ,pos
 The Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most awful amateurish film I've ever seen - ranking right up there with Manos the Hands of Fate in terms of poor acting useless direction and kindergarten-level production values. In this movie a silly-looking claymation/stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum CA and begins dining on the local hayseeds. In the thrilling climax the creature described by one local as a giant alligator with flippers drags it's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would-be lunch before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times & it dies from boredom. Every character in this moovie is a complete moron. One pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a $4.75 pint of Ripple; instead of simply buying the bottle the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander shoots at a cop gets chased towards the lake all so that he can eaten by the monster. Unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam. There's a fake magician struggling with a phony British accent (to make him seem more legit) two overly-bumbling redneck boat renters some cheesy pre-historic cave art done in crayon and annoying banjo-pickin' background moosic. In one painful scene the fake magician and his dopey wife/girlfriend/accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky even though it is clearly day time still. Even on constant fast-forward this moovie hurts and hurts bad. MooCow says call the fumigators 'cause this cow pie really stinks! :=8P ,neg
 Ally McBeal was a decent enough show but it was very overrated. The characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall short. I think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave - it was starting to outstay its welcome. ,neg
 This film is worth seeing alone for Jared Harris' outstanding portrayal of John Lennon. It doesn't matter that Harris doesn't exactly resemble Lennon; his mannerisms expressions posture accent and attitude are pure Lennon. Best scene: Lennon in a local cafe verbally sparring with a stuttering fan as to whether Paul McCartney & Wings' Silly Love Songs is worthy of #1 status in America. ,pos
 Okay 'enjoy' is a pretty relative term but flexibility is in order when you're dealing with a filmmaker of James Glickenhaus' calibre. McBain is truly one of the most ridiculous over the top action films I've ever seen without the nasty edge of The Exterminator. Other reviews have commented on a suspension of disbelief regarding the film's heroic middle aged commandos but how about making a film in the Philippines that is set in Colombia? All the extras are Filipino. In fact the only character who looks remotely Hispanic is good ol' Victor Argo as the much reviled 'El Presidente'! Oh yes we also have Maria Conchita Alonso overemoting like crazy as a rebel leader. There are tons of explosions and bodies flying everywhere in this amusing paean to the glories of American imperialism. ,neg
 A year or so ago I was watching the TV news when a story was broadcast about a zombie movie being filmed in my area. Since then I have paid particular attention to this movie called 'Fido' as it finished production and began playing at festivals. Two weeks ago Fido began playing in my local theater. And just yesterday I read a newspaper article which stated Fido is not attracting audiences in it's limited release with the exception of our local theater. In fact here it is outdrawing all other shows at The Paramount Theater including 300. Of course this makes sense as many locals want to see their city on screen or spot themselves roaming around in zombie make-up. And for any other locals who haven't seen Fido yet but are considering it I can say there are many images on screen from the school to city park to the forbidden zone that you will recognize. In fact they make the Okanagan Valley look beautiful. That's right beautiful scenery in a zombie movie! However Fido itself is a very good movie. Yes despite its flaws it is better then most of the 20 other movies playing in my local market. Fido is best described as an episode of Lassie in which the collie has been replaced by a member of the undead. This is a clever premise. And the movie even goes further by taking advantage of the 1950's emphasize on conformity and playing up the cold-war paranoia which led to McCarthyism. Furthermore it builds on the notion that zombies can be tamed or trained which George Romero first introduced in Day Of The Dead. K'Sun Ray plays a small town boy who's mother (Carrie-Ann Moss) longs for a zombie servant so she can be like all the other house wives on her block. However his dad (Dylan Baker) is against the idea as he once had to kill his own 'zombie father'. Eventually the family does acquire a zombie named 'Fido' (played by Billy Connolly) and adjusts to life with the undead. Billy Connolly was inspired casting. He is able to convey Fido's confusion longing hatred and loyalty through only his eyes lumbering body and grunts. Connolly shows that he can play understated characters better than his outrageously comedic ones. This is his best role since Mrs. Brown. Fido follows in the footsteps of other recent zomcoms such as Shawn Of The Dead and Zombie Honeymoon. Being someone who appreciates Bruce Campbell and Misty Mundae movies more than Eli Roth and Jigsaw ones I prefer humor over gore in my horror. However I understand the criticism of those horror fans who feel there is not enough 'undead carnage' in Fido. Yet I am sure patient viewers will be rewarded by the films gentle humor. The movie does break down in it's third act. It's as if the writers were so wrapped up in the cute premise of domesticated zombies in the 1950s they forgot about the story arc. However given my interest in horror comedies and my appreciation for seeing the neighborhood on screen I rate Fido 9 out of 10. ,pos
 It's a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie. Besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments what's so difficult about capturing the robbers? Just eliminate the bank workers see who was at the bank-from all the cameras' footage angles-prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages. Where is the suspense every body is talking about? It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door... seen it many times. At least Mr. Spike Lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting. The Movie is not worth it. Pronto! ,neg
 Like Ishtar and King of Comedy other great misunderstood comedies Envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers (may be too harsh a word I will call them suburban under-achievers). This film was a dark comedy gem and I'm not sure what people expect. I relish seeing a major studio comedy that isn't filled with obvious humor and I believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile. The look on Stiller's face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves. Yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. There were a lot of great scenes (the J-Man's decrepit cabin by the lake Corky's unceremonious burial Weitz's wife role and Walken's J-Man -- all great stuff. I can't stand people that get on IMDb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one. I will take Envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year (save Napoleon Dynamite.) It's wittier wackier and an offbeat enjoyable gem. Remember this people; Most times Popular doesn't equal Good. ,pos
 Man I really find it hard to believe that the wonderful Alan Ball had anything to do with this mess. Having seen the first two episodes thus far I think I can safely say this show isn't going to be on my must see list. It's just got so many things working against it. None of the actors cast are particularly good. Anna Paquin as the lead character Sookie is just awful. I remember her being better in a lot of other things I've seen her in so maybe it's just the writing. She's not really much fun to look at either there are moments where to be honest she looks downright ugly. The actor who plays Bill is marginally better if only because his character is supposed to be sort of wooden and aloof. The other actors do their best but with the clichÃ© characters with difficult to perform accents they are given it's a tough job. Tara is an absolute misery to watch Rutina Wesley absolutely murders the accent. It's like nails on a chalkboard bad. Almost as awful is Nelsan Ellis it's difficult to understand what he's even saying sometimes. Both his character as well as Tara's also seem a bit racist to me. I don't know having a character say 'whycome' on an HBO show that isn't The Wire just seems a bit odd. Rounding out the cast so far are Sookie's doddering grandmother her sex addict brother and the only bit of genius casting I've seen in William Sanderson as the sheriff. The story seems to be meandering towards it's destination at this point with no real worry about keeping the viewer interested. The romance stuff is very Dark Shadow-sy. Although this show ups the camp factor from something like those old Dark Shadows episodes times about ten. At times it seemed so campy to me that I just have to assume it was intended to be. But unlike a show such as Buffy that pulled camp off masterfully this show does not. Out of place with the campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show. I'm not averse to either of these when they are done well as they have in many other HBO shows but here at least they prolonged rough sex scenes involving Jason Stackhouse seem a bit over the top and pointless. About the only nice thing I can really think to say about this mess is that I liked the opening title sequence. HBO has had a string of bad luck with their shows lately I hope they cancel this after the first season and try to get something better on the air. ,neg
 What a fun movie experience! I was expecting a sappy kids movie and found that I enjoyed it more than my teens. Take a tissue it's not sad just 'moving' in parts. Finally its a 'feel good' flick for the whole family. Note: It's 2+ hours so consider leaving the littlest 'squirmers' home for this one. AP ,pos
 Yuck! And again I say...YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And it had a naked chick on a motorcycle. This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife. There was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry... ,neg
 I got to say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was uber cute and I mean uber cute. It had all the sex content that most Ivan Reitman comedies have but with something a lil extra CHEMISTRY. Uma and Luke both have this awkrawrd but believable chemistry that seem to transcend in each scene . Both seem to create this odd twisted and interesting relationship with powerful sexual tension that you laugh until you can't feel your face anymore. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting cast seem to play off each other's roles perfectly and even Wanda Sykes' rather small role will keep you laughing. Though these kind of comedies aren't for everybody but I have to say I went with a person that doesn't usually enjoy these films and he was laughing like crazy. This movie is certainly not for everyone. especially younger children since some moments are little too...well lets say ADULT for younger viewers. All in all I was pleasantly surprised by this movie tough the ending I found was a little weak compared to the rest of the film. (3 1/2* out of 5*) ,pos
 Without question the worst ELVIS film ever made. The movie portrays all Indians as drunk stupid and lazy. Watch ELVIS's skin change color throughout the film. ,neg
 The only good thing about this unfunny dreck is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free at college. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free it's hopeless. Stale acting and poor jokes cannot be masked by an excellent yet bewildering set design (that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie but I have never seen anything more depressing. This was nothing more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch (which has its opponents but I enjoyed it very much). It's difficult not to sit through this failure and wonder what better projects were passed over to fund it. You want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with the Grinch. ,neg
 Yeah it's a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but it's actually pretty good - and I consider myself a manly man. You gotta love Judy Davis no matter what she's in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing performance. The scenery of the small coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie. The unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention. Overall I give it an 8/10. Go see it. ,pos
 Wow... I picked this up at the local Wal-Mart after reading online that it had been released early. I've been following this online for some time and just had to buy the film. Wow... I guess the thing that really struck me was the editing or lack thereof. Time and again characters (usually The Narrator and whoever he is with) are shown walking...and walking...and walking. I am not an editor but I do know that you can cut between someone leaving point A to show them arriving at point B. There is no need to show almost the entire journey! Wow... I actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. They seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy depending on what action was to be added at a later date. Wow... Why it was decided to do almost all the effects using CG is beyond me. Even ILM still employs miniatures sometimes. One of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of (according to the end credits) the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities including London. At times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. In one shot in London there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrator's brother (played by star Anthony Piana without his distracting mustache). Not since GETTYSBURG have I seen such a fake piece of facial hair. Wow... Why Timothy Hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. It is a turkey plain and simple. On the plus side (at least for me) it has provided some of the most genuine laugh-out-loud bits of hilarity I have seen in quite a while. ,neg
 I noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults. It probably earned some of them but it wasn't that bad. Well I'll be honest: I never want to see this film again. It was a bad film. But I don't hate this film it tried to tell a story. As a drama this film could work very well actually. I just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this (they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy). With a rewrite it could have been a great film. But as a satire it didn't work in its current form -- many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot: for example the robbery scene makes little sense in the story. Still it wasn't the worst independent film ever made -- is it in the Top 10 Worst? That's debatable. ,neg
 I watched this movie expecting what I got: good sci-fi cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a great job with an extremely limited role. Imagine trying to act under these two restraints: you have hardly any dialogue and because you are playing a hardass military robot you are not allowed to show emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? Kinda like asking a diva to perform a great aria while gagged and duct-taped. In spite of being verbally and expressionally handcuffed Russell pulls off an incredible characterization. His robot becomes human in spite of the constraints. Great job! As usual Jason Isaacs insures that he will go down in history as a great portrayer of the consummate villain--the one you'd love to see drawn and quartered. Connie Nielsen was sweet soft motherly and gorgeous. I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much on her physical beauty but it was hard to take one's eyes off her. Unfortunately Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. Much of the plot is quite standard with a fair amount of weaknesses but as it does have a sci-fi comic book feeling I don't see what's wrong with a few weaknesses. By the end of the story the good guy wins and the appreciative audience receives a great deal of emotional satisfaction. Yes! The sort of feeb who thinks that Russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same sort of feeb who missed the whole point. ,pos
 I understand this film to be a debut feature and as such it is very impressive. It has the feel and pacing of a true indie yet director Todd Yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision command and judgment of a mature and seasoned professional. The shots are well framed and thought out and serve to move the story forward. He and screenwriter Ivan Solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical paint by numbers type scripts. It's a story that needs Judd Hirsch caliber character talent to have a shot at working. Judd is fantastic as usual; as are Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise though is Elliot Korte who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to coax nuance out of the young actor in a role that could have been easily devalued by stereotype or overreach. Anyway I found the film refreshing and entertaining. ,pos
 The first of two Jim Thompson adaptations released in 1990 (the other being the more well-known GRIFTERS) AFTER DARK has all of Thompson's hallmarks: dangerous women the confidence game and characters that are either not as dim as others suspect them of being or not as harmless. Jason Patric is superb as a former boxer disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring (director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire sequences to flesh out the back story) and the too-little-seen Rachel Ward also delivers a great performance. But Bruce Dern is the film's secret weapon: his sweet-talking grifter Uncle Bud subtly commands each of his scenes. there's almost no comic relief in this film so watch it prepared to be sucked into the void. ,pos
 Indian Summer is a warm multi-character film that would make a fine afternoon film (with a bit of editing). The film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present when a group of adults from the golden age of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp Uncle Lou. The film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp and form new memories in their latest stay. The film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments. Watching these people reminisce and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well. It never goes to over the top and melodramatic always keeping its warmth charm and realism. I've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself. For a warm nostalgic character movie I sincerely recommend. ,pos
 I don't think anyone besides Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung makes cinema on a purer level than Claire Denis. That said I don't love this her newest film quite as much as her 2001 masterpiece Trouble Every Day (although it comes very close) which itself is one of my absolute favorite films. It it only because the narrative here is possibly slightly too elliptical for it's own good. Don't get me wrong the fact that this film barely has a plot at all is really one of the best things about it but I think Denis took it about one degree farther than it needed to go and consequently the film does flirt with incomprehensibility and a few key plot points should have been clarified somehow (like that the main character goes to South Korea to get his heart transplant instead of just showing him there all of a sudden without any explanation of where he is or why he is there). Also some of the other characters seemed unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for Denis to use actors she likes yet again (Beatrice Dalle's character in particular is a little distracting because you keep expecting that she is going to have some significance). Still the film is incredibly absorbing and the cinematography is beyond amazing. It is definitely very much a masterpiece in it's own way. At least as good as Denis' more highly-acclaimed Beau travail if not better. Claire Denis has to be my favorite French director at this point better than Leos Carax even. Also I have to admit that the South Korean sequence really does do Lost in Translation better than that film itself does (and I unlike some am a huge fan of that film as well). ,pos
 Leslie Sands' stilted play Deadlock becomes a poor-choice vehicle for Bette Davis and Gary Merrill just after their joint-success in All About Eve . After killing her spouse a scheming woman is visited by her husband's best friend who passes himself off as her husband once others begin stopping by the house. Irving Rapper one of Bette's best directors from her peak years is sadly unable to elevate this ridiculous material in which Davis is curiously aloof and restrained until the outrageous finale (where she thankfully pulls out all the stops). Production and supporting cast strictly second-rate; only for Bette Davis completists. *1/2 from **** ,neg
 Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese cinema taking very creative directors editors and photographers and working on historic themes what the Japanese call period pieces . Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color photography and editing. Brilliant even. The new wave of Japanese samurai films allows a peek at traditional beliefs in shamanism demons and occult powers that were certainly a part of their ancient culture but not really explored in Kurosawa's samurai epics or the Zaitochi series. Another fine example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I would place director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave Japanese directors. Other recent Japanese period pieces I would highly recommend include Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003). ,pos
 My wife Kate and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one (hopefully there is a sequel!). I would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because I am old and grey and still interested in life:-). If anyone has the full lyrics please send them. Of course one big reason why my wife and I liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually. It's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience. The human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show. This series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites Spooks and Hustle . ,pos
 I tried as hard as I could to sit all the way through this irritating mess but I just couldn't do it. Brad Dourif absolutely sucked as the lead and all the supporting cast were only marginally worse. The whole thing is just ludicrous from the awful acting to the laughable FX to the stupid plot. Complete waste of time; don't bother. Root Canal therapy would be more enjoyable. Bamboo slivers under the fingernails would be a lot more pleasant. Watching a Uwe Boll movie would be only a little worse than this. Get the idea? ,neg
 Why did it sound like the husband kept calling her Appy ? It ruined a great episode and so I can only give it a 6. Proper grammar and pronunciation are essential to a film. It was very Hellraiser what with all the skin ripping though I dunno how anyone can survive without skin the skin is a vital organ to the body the biggest organ actually and without we would die. The more a horror film is true the more creepy it can be and more entertaining. I do admit though that the stories from the great horror directors are very disappointing and very mediocre. 6/10 come on Yankies get your English up to par ! ,pos
 Nothing positive to say. Meandering nonsense huffing and puffing with a message . New Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (Cuckoo comes to mind) yet many have the bouquet of cardboard and the aftertaste of asbestos (Nochnoi Dozor would be a good example). This is a dozor type of emptiness. Acting would be horrible if not for the saving grace of utterly unappealing direction and incompetent editing that sometimes is so awful that it distracts from the impotence of the actors. Special award to the cameraman for making sure that every shot is shaky (would someone please realize that Blair Witch has had its 15 seconds of undeserved fame?) and takes are geared towards attention-deficit pre-teens who subside on CounterStrike and masturbation. The female lead poses and tries to look seductive too often male antihero need a diction coach (although genetics aren't bad: rather expressive eyes.) One (middle) finger for this irrelevant pile of non-art. Anyone who reviews this positively better be a (distant) cousin of the auteurs . ,neg
 This film looked interesting; I'd read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly. Started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations. In fact I didn't bother watching the whole thing... utter drivel - bad performances bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters - that was the point of the film I guess. Watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekend. Do not bother with this feature. ,neg
 I really really love this show! I have always liked the 1990's shows of Space Ghost! This show was hilarious and I can't believe why Cartoon Network's Adult Swim would take such a funny show like this off the air. I hope they put this show on DVD or something. The show is about Brak (from the Space Ghost cartoons SGCC and Cartoon Planet) who lives his every day life with his Mom and Dad and his best friend who likes to drop in a lot Zorak! My favorite episodes were the one where Zorak gets this really good singing voice and then his voice doesn't give him any money that Zorak made from singing at all. Another episode I like is the one where Brak and Zorak didn't finish their homework and then they go back from Sunday to Friday and they just goof off and then they go back to the day homework was invented and then when they go back to the present homework didn't exist! Another episode I like is the one where Brak's Dad and their next door neighbor Thundercleese the Robot keep getting into this agrument and then they get eaten by a giant worm. Another episode I liked was the one where Zorak makes a bully stand and then some new guy took over his stand. I also like a lot of the other episodes! One thing that never fails to make me laugh is when Zorak is getting beaten up blasted and zapped! ,pos
 This movie was poorly written poorly acted and very predictable. It was very low-budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video. It wasn't even campy fun it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1-1/2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them. The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this. ejames6342 ,neg
 That's what the title should be anyway. This movie combines guns explosives and mindless killing to make one flop of an action movie. Let me make my point in a series of questions: answers type deal. What happens in the movie? People die. Is that it? Yes. What is the plot about? What plot? What is the point the movie is trying to make? Killing is the only solution. What are the characters like? Extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities. Is there anything good about this movie? Yes. I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras in filming it. If you like constant killing and greed then watch the movie. If you happen to be repulsed by such low-standard entertainment then Made Men is not for you. To sum it up the plotline stinks the characters aren't worth their while the storyline is completely resistable and nothing fits together. This proves one thing: the actors directors and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren't Made . ,neg
 Man has been to the farthest reaches of the earth and now he is traveling to new worlds. But with new worlds come ancient evils... the vampires of space. And not just a handful but entire tribes. In this film (which I saw as Bloodsuckers but I guess also goes as Vampires Wars ) we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings meet the imperialist vampires. I will make this review very short because it's undeserving of a good review. The best I can say for this film is it has a good cast of b-list and upcoming stars. Natassia Malthe was Quintana and was far more attractive here than in Bloodrayne 2 . Michael Ironside is Muco and is always a fan favorite (as I say he's the poor man's Jack Nicholson). And we even get Carrie-Ann Fleming as Damian's wife who horror fans will now recognize as the eponymous Jenifer from Dario Argento's Jenifer . So this movie as bad as it is isn't without some names attached... but the same can be said of Uwe Boll's work. The concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space isn't necessarily a bad idea but it easily falls into the realm of cheese and this film falls hard. The acting especially from the vampires is over the top and I just didn't find the explanations of their existence very convincing. Worst of all the vampire tribes have the names Voorhess and Leatherfaces . I understand this was supposed to be a clever reference for the horror fans but it wasn't clever at all. It just sounded dumb and out of place (unlike the much more subtle references in James Gunn's Slither such as naming stores after lesser-known horror directors). That's all I want to say. If you can stand lots of cheese (on this day I couldn't and I'm from Wisconsin) and want to see average actors with poor costumes fight vampires in space (although space looks a lot like any other forest on earth) check this one out if you can find it. I don't personally recommend this when you can watch other cheesy vampires films (Jon Carpenter's Vampires ) or other cheesy space movies. Or maybe even some good ones. But hey do your thing. ,neg
 Words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is. I wish it were so bad it's good but it's not. It's just dull lifeless and boring. It's so bad I couldn't even laugh at it. In response to other posters Anne-Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie. The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly who as a true statement on vanity cast himself as the male lead. They both look like inbreeds sister and brother. The gal Sherry Thurig is a looker. The complete opposite of Anne-Marie - attractive. This girl is tall and willowy and can act. Although you can tell she's holding back. All the actors seem to be holding back especially the supporting male Mark. I've seen less wood in a rain forest but he's still better than Kelly. Why would Kelly keep his actors from acting? Is he really that bad a director? Everyone else has summed the story up perfectly - there isn't one. Kids are kidnapped and Kelly steps in poo to solve the crime. I know how he felt stepping in the poo it's how I felt after watching his movie. Yes I tried to get my money back from the rental store. This is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director (and if you search them out you'll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks). ,neg
 A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up sometimes slightly down. However I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it upon its theatrical release I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10 the equivalent of an F letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event I loved it this time giving it a 9 out of 10 or an A . It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film and the modus operandi of the villain humorous or not are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme. Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various clichÃ©-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However in light of the above the film is intentionally clichÃ©d implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material but the twist there was that the film was self-aware . Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm reading too much into the film it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something more adult . Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said While it was a fine book I didn't think it was the right story for a film . So instead the novel which is much dryer and more serious in tone was used as a launching pad a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme. Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout with complex deep colors interesting sets and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz as Adam Carr is involved in many of the funniest moments. While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more. ,pos
 Everyone plays their part pretty well in this little nice movie . Belushi gets the chance to live part of his life differently but ends up realizing that what he had was going to be just as good or maybe even better. The movie shows us that we ought to take advantage of the opportunities we have not the ones we do not or cannot have. If U can get this movie on video for around $10 itÂ´d be an investment! ,pos
 I was the Production Accountant on this movie and I also got to do some voice-over work on it so I'm not entirely unbiased but if it were awful I would say so. I thought it was a fun film not a critically acclaimed masterpiece by any means but there were plenty of laughs along the way. The Bible states that laughter does good like a medicine so watching this movie could be good for your health. So many of the actors in this picture hadn't yet reached their peak at the time we made this film. Susan Sarandon of course is one who has since gone on to much greater fame. Melanie Mayron was seen on TV on a weekly basis as a photographer in the Thirty-Something TV drama series. Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger still haunting people's dreams. One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comedic actor and a truly nice sincere person. We all had fun working on this show and I think that fun comes through. ,pos
 As others have pointed out this movie is a load of pretentious drivel for the mindless or masochists. We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house without a good dose of humour or gritty realism movies like this do not work. And even more importantly without a decent script a movie will not work and there is nothing new inspiring or thought provoking about the script for this movie. The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta's shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty bad at the moment but unfortunately the British industry is even worse. This movie is so bad I wouldn't even bother renting it from the weeklies section. Do yourself a favour and give this movie a wide berth. ,neg
 If you like a syfi soap opera this show is for you as fare as I am concerned it does not work for me and after watching 3 episodes I just can't watch it anymore. It is boring and slow and for a show that the timeline is based around 100.000+ years ago if you base it on battlestar galactica's timeline for arriving on earth they sure seem to have all the same stuff around like the 100.000 year old Chevy vans driving down the streets and people watching the 100.000 year old popular name brand LCD T.V. sets. It also goes the same with the rest of the sets as well on the show there is just to much of today's stuff involved in it to not overlook I think they could have done a lot better of a job to get around these issues and yes battlestar galactica had some of the same issues but not nearly as bad. As fare as the rest of the show it is not nearly as good as BSG was and it is a poor pre sequel to itÂ…. ,neg
 Massive multiple chills down the spine! I'm surprised there's people who didn't like it! I saw it at 10 o'clock in the morning and still got scared stiff! And I've seen hundreds of thrillers/horror movies! For crying out loud I'm 22!!! I mean OK voice acting not particularly good probably even b-movie-ish. But the genuine look of terror the sound effects the flow! From the very start hitting you again and again with relentless unforgiving terrorising scenes! So many clichÃ©s yet none fails to surprise/scare! You know it's coming it's coming it's coming BOO! and you still jump off the chair. Grab a pillow and a blanket call your closest friend over and do not watch it at night! Hats off to the Japanese! ,pos
 An ultra-modern house in an affluent neighborhood appears to be the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre (and deadly) behavior. Or at least that is what Lara Flynn Boyle's character Col Kennedy argues. After a series of deadly occurrences in a gargantuan house next door Col knows something has got to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also stars as the mysterious architect. My opinion: The House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the locations (beautiful house) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress not to mention absolutely stunning. She brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing. Without her it would have failed. It's so alive declares a prospective buyer in reference to the house. Yes it is alive. But the story itself is not so much. Barring Boyle's presence not much is happening here as an enormous amount of the movie is spent watching or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I liked it anyway. The cinematography lends the film a polished look. 8/10 on account of Boyle the premise of an evil ultra-modern house the locations and cinematography and set decoration and wardrobe. ,pos
 I wasn't born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily I managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90's and the rest is history......I was hooked. The premise was pretty simple; two hardened Nemesis agents Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling ( William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) are partnered up with an expert (if not young) Doctor and Biologist (Sharron Macready) to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china. Whilst making their escape their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the Himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come... The series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and I guess it was its relatively short lived one season run that has set it up for cult status. Monty Berman the producer was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets - particularly in Episodes such as Happening ( a studio deputising for the Australian outback) and the 'snow' sets of Operation Deep Freeze and The Beginning but if you can get past this and focus on the characters and the story lines the show was really a lot of fun. It had a great mix of adventure and plenty of deadpan humour (mainly from some terrific one liners from William Gaunt). The chemistry from the three leads was fantastic - you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show (and laugh about Anthony Nicholls awful wig!!). They all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine. I have to say I was always a Richard Barrett fan - I loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge - he was certainly a man you didn't cross and those eyes........the bluest eyes you would probably see on TV. I have also followed Bill Gaunts career with interest since. However Craig Stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and I am sure Alexandra Bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too. The show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with including Donald Sutherland Jeremy Brett Peter Wyngarde Burt Kwouk Anton Rodgers Kate O'Mara Jenny Linden Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. Notable episodes for me were : Auto Kill The Interrogation The Fanatics The Mission and The Gilded Cage but I am sure every one has their personal favourites. If you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time or to re watch it after many years remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and I don't think I will ever tire of it. Enjoy! ,pos
 Making a book into a movie by following the story page-by-page is NEVER a good idea. When people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress. And everybody's mind's-eye opus is different which is why when the 'REAL' movie finally comes out you're always going to have a ticked-off segment of the movie-going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn't measure up. All a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see. There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of Stephen King. When filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying (CARRIE 'SALEM'S LOT THE DEAD ZONE) or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd-awful mess (Kubrick's version of THE SHINING; the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS). Although it's not even close to being the perfect King adaptation PET SEMATARY has so many moments of just skin-and-bone-deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. For that we have music video-turned-film director Mary Lambert to thank (she also directed SIESTA not exactly a horror movie but another freaky-as-hell must-see you should put on your list) working from a screenplay by the 'Man-ster' Himself and probably one of his better ones. Since the majority of you know the story I won't put you to sleep with too many of the details. Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country. Well almost perfect except for two nasty little details: the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son...well even if you haven't read the book do the frickin' math. It IS a King story after all so no mystery where this is headed. It's not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way. Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery scream-inducing life here: Rachel Creed's (STAR TREK'S Denise Crosby) horrific memory of her terminally ill crippled sister; Louis's encounters with the mortally injured jogger Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist) both before and after his death; the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery. And that third act...if it doesn't give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulse. Good performances by all here especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well-intentioned neighbor Jud Crandall who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up: Sometimes dead is better. About the only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louis's son Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this Lambert and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately Hughes at the time was just too damn CUTE to sell his intended role as an evil demon-possessed zombie. This takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where he's featured are still masterfully staged (especially Gwynne's death scene.) Other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title for best King adaptation as far as I'm concerned; but SEMATARY is right up there in the Top Five. Still will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story? Not BLOODY likely...for now. ,pos
 Do not see this movie if you value your mind. At the end of our collective viewing me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5% of our brains during its course. The only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer. Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. I realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion this movie has bred a deep hatred within me. I hate this movie so very very much. Some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If only it didn't take itself seriously. But it does. The plot is a warmed over version of Blade Runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. The dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg isn't even trying but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex is like fingernails on the soul. And whether its Juliet Landua with her off again on again British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the blustering Commissioner you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment. I recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall. ,neg
 This is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers.The director's desire to sound American is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since Peeping Tom . Two male cops (or one and a half more like as you will see) horrible murders a plot more complicated than complex.Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre(see the astoundlingly dumb l'inconnu de Strasbourg a couple of years ago).The scenes with his pregnant wife -which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot-are among the worst ever filmed.Add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience.A violent and absurd conclusion followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the cÃ´te d'azur it's really the silence of the lame. ,neg
 This drama is unlike Sex and the City where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other. Its much more personal and people can relate to it. Its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like Sex and the City Lipstick Jungle.... Dr. Katie Roden is a psychologist with a dark secret she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends. She is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son's advances on her. Her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well. Trudi Malloy a widow is battling issues with letting go of her dead husband from 9/11. And when a handsome stranger Richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business. The ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between Richard and Trudi are totally funny! It is interesting to note that Richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the 9/11 board for her husband's death..lets see what his intentions are Siobhan Dillon a lawyer is fed up of her husband's love making tactics which only involve baby making (as they are having trouble conceiving) and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his services a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long!It will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband (played by Raza Jeffrey) Jessica a real estate business woman is single and is straight until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them. Her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a married man her colleague. Lets see where her character venture to.... The beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 totally different women with different scenarios whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown. Its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be safe ! ,pos
 This is the fifth von Trier film I have seen. I believe that he is the only director to whom I have given such a high score on all his movies. Four of them The Element of Crime Europa Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark I have given a 10 and one The Idiots I have given a 9 (and I have been reconsidering whether to give it a 10 since I first saw it although I'd like to see it once more before I do). He has been chided for calling himself one of the best working directors. I tend to agree with him. I cannot blame him for being arrogant when he has made such great films. In 50 years when von Trier retires he will be looked upon as the pre-eminent film artist from Europe (perhaps from the planet) and there will be classes taught in his name. He simply is the Bergman or Fellini of our time. It is too bad the critics are too intrigued with themselves to notice this. About Europa itself I'll admit that it was confusing and that its narrative did not seem strong. I think that's the point. This film was obviously meant to represent a nightmare or the subconscious at some level. This is absolutely clear from the framing of the film: Max von Sydow's narration. We are hypnotized or von Trier is hypnotized and this is our/his subconscious mind. I'm inclined to lean more towards his mind since the degradation of Europe concerns me an American very little. This framing is also clear if you have seen The Element of Crime an even more brilliant film than this (although I am disputing that in my mind; what Europa needs more than anything is a proper release on DVD hopefully Criterion again with theatrical aspect ratio and remastered sound and picture; then I am fairly sure this film would seem as great as any of von Trier's other films). In The Element of Crime the film begins with a hypnotist whom we actually see on screen this time is hypnotizing Fisher a European detective who wants to get to the root of his mental anguish. The first words of that film are Fantasy is okay but my job is to keep you on track. And whenever Fisher the narrator gets off track the hypnotist does chastize him and tells him to get back on with the story. He even laughs when a character is given a really silly and trite line. Something along the lines of Do you understand the difference between good and evil? The hypnotist laughs and says Now Fisher she didn't really say that did she? So the key to interpreting Europa almost a sequel of sorts to The Element of Crime is that we are deep in our/von Trier's subconscious and the symbols there are to be interpreted within ourselves and will likely be different for everyone. What does the train itself symbolize? Consider it internally and only then discuss it externally. Europa is a great film a masterpiece. I was never bored by it even though I watched it at 3 am. The perfect time to watch actually since it works in dream logic. ,pos
 I realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic. That is the only positive thing I can say about this truly horrid adaptation. Have you read 'Wise Blood?' It's an amazing book. Flannery O'Connor wrote about the south as no one else has. She was a southerner herself a devout catholic and a remarkably gifted writer. In her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith doubt and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness. The characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south but I can assure you that such people do exist. Not only do they exist they are human beings with families feelings and concerns like anyone else. Flannery's intentions were so often misunderstood - she was not lampooning these backwoods zealots - she saw in them the beautiful operation of what she would have called 'grace'...even in the most violent distressing and maddening of circumstances. To read 'Wise Blood' is to be washed over with a sense of dread and impending doom. Finally it is to think long and hard about our judgments and preconceptions - our entire world view. None of this comes through in John Huston's 'Gilligan's Island'-like adaptation. None. It is a farce. A bad farce. The entire film is saturated with a hauteur that turns the stomach. The acting is poor the southern accents are fake and insulting. The filmmakers show no insight into the thinking of religious southerners. Ms. O'Connor's intense prose are reduced to sight gags and cheap amateur theatre. The soundtrack is a mixture of hayseed silliness and 'Clockwork Orange'-style cheeseball electronics that doesn't fit the story or even the MOVIE. I was granted free admission to this movie and almost walked out. Truly truly terrible. As an aside I do not agree with Ms. O'Connor's religious views and while I was raised in the deep south years ago I made my way north and have not looked back. But the south is a beautiful place full of fascinating individuals (like every other place on earth) and the cartoonish mockery with which southerners and their attitudes are dealt in this movie borders on offensive. If you're into being offended (which I am not) then this movie most DEFINITELY crosses the line. I don't like to talk crap about an artist's work - John Huston was a man that I did not know and I'm sure he was a sincere and gifted filmmaker to which his respected place in film history attests. My views are clearly skewed by having read (and loved) Flannery O'Connor's work. So I don't claim to be coming from any other perspective. Maybe as a stand-alone film it works for cinephiles. But for Flannery O'Connor fans - and I might add for self-respecting southerners and openminded individuals of all stripes - this movie is a waste of time. ,neg
 But how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can't win. For George Knox it is not easy. As the movie opens Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) are riding on thier bikes around the angels' stadium. When they return to thier foster mother's home Roger is suprised to have a visit from his dad (Dermot Mulroney). His mom is dead! And when he asks his father when they going to be a family again he father jokes I say when the angels win the division championship So later on Roger and J.P hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball. When the manger George Knox (Danny Glover) take out his pitcher the pitcher gets mad and gets into a fight with him and soon the angels team get into the fightm that gets Knox ejected from the game. That night Roger makes a prayer for the angles win the championship. When his foster mother Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and J.P go to a basball Roger sees real angles come on the field and helps the left fielder (Matthew McConaughey) makes a catch that leaves the manger and the play-by-play man (Jay. O Sanders) how did he to that. Roger learns from the head angel (Christopher Lloyd) that only he can see the angles because he was the only that prayed for help. 10/10 ,pos
 First this film is not a thriller. Neither is it gripping taut. It might have been so based on the script but the direction's slow pace makes it difficult to get into. The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious. Unfortunately we only get a sense of *how* ingenious after the picture is over. That leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that don't grab the viewer and cunning vixen scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence. I wish this had been the fast-paced thriller the box promised. It would've been an outstanding film. Instead Spike Lee made it plod along through the end. ,neg
 Jerome Crabbe has the lead role in this movie. I saw this movie 6 times and I still am not tired of it. This movie is similar to Flesh + Blood in some ways. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote all of Paul Verhoeven's Dutch films. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I have seen all of his movies all except for Showgirls. My Mom does not like him so much but I disagree. I think all of his films are a ride to watch especially Total Recall and Basic Instinct. Jerry Goldsmith did some of his movies which include Total Recall Basic Instinct and Hollow Man. I wish Jerry Goldsmith never died. Dutch films are different but still enjoyable. ,pos
 The Danes character finally let's Buddy have the awful truth. Leave me alone kiss men if you want to she screams self-righteously in front of everyone thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long. Nice girl. This might be the place to reconsider all of the giggly charm that Danes pours into this character. Great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying but hey remember there are no mistakes except maybe seeing this film. Wait a minute. This irony is intended! This is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit yes! But somehow I doubt that's what the creators of this film had in mind sadly. Maybe there are a few mistakes after all. ,pos
 I am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the so bad it's good type of viewing. However I really like this film for its fun factor and - believe it or not - it's innovation. The whole thing has a ring of John Waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a text-book lesson in how to use movement) and is framed by some unexpected stars. You may not like this film you may not enjoy it but if you get the chance to watch it then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars. Highly reccomended. ,pos
 This movie commits what I would call an emotional rape on the viewer. The movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue for that matter). The main character's metamorphosis from good but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent whereas the rape scene (being an over-dragged exaggerated version of the rape scene from A clockwork orange ) is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values. There are some things an artist should not do to try and achieve his/her goal. At least in my opinion. To wrap it up: shockingly brutal revolting and NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. See A clockwork orange or Le pianiste instead. ,neg
 I am a big fan of low budget horror movies like this but come on! This has to be the worst piece of monkey S@#t I have ever seen! I ignored the reviews posted on this site figuring that it would fall into my taste in horror but I got bored and turned it off.Let's see: The wardrobe: Consisted of cheap cameo outfits and painters outfits from home depot. The masks were made from what looks like tin foil. The Gore: The Gore was pretty good I must give it that. But Ittenbach's Burning moon was better for a low budget movie. Acting: Was horrible! I didn't mind the dubbing. I find this humorous like in Ittenbach's Premutos (great movie). The fighting and action sequences were pi$$ poor. Bottom line: Don't watch any of Schnaas's movies. There are much better directors like Jorg Buttergeit and Olaf Ittenbach with movies of the same gore and subject matter. Check Premutos House of blood Schramm and the nekromantiks. ,neg
 Director Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of varied quality but most of the films he made in his native country are indisputable masterworks. This is the story of alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman. But the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman's handsome male lover. In the meantime the writer is plagued with strange visions - at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions. Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller very original and provocative. I love films that make you think they are about something but then you realize they are about something completely different. This is one of those movies; a thriller during the first half and a quasi-religious surrealist saga during the second half. Very erotic original and blasphemous not for kids or people that go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography by future director Jan de Bont. Highly Reommended! ,pos
 As I reach the backside of 35 I find myself shaking my head more and more at the sex crazed drug influenced teens of today. It was great to be reminded that it was just as crazy for me back in my day as it is for teens today. This film drives that point home to the core. If you are a late 70's fan you'll love the film. From KISS-posters to an Angel concert this movie rocks ! Watch for a young Laura Dern. Why they didn't have more songs from the Runaways I'll never know ? I did have a problem with Randy Quaid's character deflowering a 16 year old girl. While he was away she and her friends have a party that destroys dude's house. The cops come and everything but no mention of all the underage drinking and how these kids got their hands on this stuff. Foxes belongs right there with Over the Edge Fast Times Dazed & Confused and Kids as one of the all time teen angst flicks. I say buy it and watch it with your kids and talk about it all. ,pos
 Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let's just say that good old TheatreX took one for the team on this one. Guess what the plots about? Zombies taking over. This time though for the sake of originality (?) this film takes place in Rhode Island and to be honest I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie flick based in Rhode Island. A TV station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won't think that there's any problem in the world that is those that never look or go outside anyway. I will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film. There is actually somewhat of a story to this but I'm not bothering with that because after a while you'll either not care or have fallen asleep. At any rate this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the seen it all before stuff that gets trotted out before the camera. Trust me you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this. 3 out of 10. ,neg
 The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film. I have no words no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film I sat through last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast. The dialog was so contrived the family was this cookie cutter Walton's family and the film has been so many times before that I am shocked someone thought it was an original idea. Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a GOOD film. ,neg
 Though I'd heard that Cama de Gato was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade I watched it giving it a chance; after all first-time director/producer/writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature (shot in video) for just US$ 4 000 and -- though it looks even cheaper -- I can't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it (then as I watched it I realized why). But whatever chances you're ready to give to Cama de Gato they shrink to zero within 10 minutes: it's an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-Nazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence (and they're made to look like closeted gays too) made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube -- only here it lasts NINETY TWO (count'em) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and it's not even funny-bad. We've all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong -- there's gang-rape spanking murder the accidental death (falling down the staircase!!) of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. Moral and literal garbage get it? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially Kids and Bully ) but Clark's films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high-class masterworks compared to this crap. I don't think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience's throat: Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you DO get numb-minded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on. Stockler doesn't care a bit about technique (the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling) but he's a narcissistic control-freak: he anticipates the criticisms he's bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie/cutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is (I could relate to THAT). Despite his megalomaniac ambitions Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he can't even decide if he wants gritty realism (hand-held video camera etc) or stylization (repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc). Damn he can't even decide WHERE to put his camera (there's use of subjective camera for the THREE leads)! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the director's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. All you see is a filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or technique) to go with it. It's very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineo's Blat can be highly effective under good direction (as in Carandiru Lavoura Arcaica Proibido Proibir ). Here he's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped actors in recent memory. He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes (so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn). The film opens and ends with real interviews with typical (?) middle-class youth -- Stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what he's trying to preach in fiction. But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting a highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements (which only shows assholes exist everywhere). Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middle-class youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE they're middle-class and enjoy recreational drugs (is he saying all neo-fascists are on drugs?? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? I couldn't tell). With its dogmatic self-righteousness headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom Cama de Gato is bad for a 1 000 reasons but above all it's harmful in a very insidious manner: it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument. Cama de Gato is best unwatched unmentioned buried and forgotten. ,neg
 This is an early film Pilot for the hit Canadian tv show Trailer Park Boys. It was played to executives at a few networks before Showcase decided to sign them up for a tv series. Great acting and a very funny cast make this one of the best cult comedy films. The movie plot is that these two small time criminals go around exterminating peoples pets for money. If you have a dog next door whos barking all night these are the guys you go to! But they get into trouble when they come across a job too big for them to deal with and end up in a shootout. Watch this movie if you want to understand the beginning of the tv series. I highly recommend it! Rated R for swearing violence and drug use. Its not too offensive either (they dont actually show killing animals) ,pos
 I rate this 10 out of 10. Why? * It offers insight into something I barely understand - the surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing; Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is a great history of surfing; I have never surfed but I love surfing movies and have seen many. None taught me what this movie did * The movie was very well edited. It flowed well. The interviews were outstanding * It's interesting from start to finish In summary it's about as good as a documentary as I have seen so I have to rate in terms of that. So 10/10 ,pos
 I am a lover of B movies give me a genetically mutated bat and I am in heaven. These movies are good for making you stop thinking of everything else going on in your world. Even a stupid B movie will usually make me laugh and I will still consider it a good thing. Then there was Hammerhead which was so awful I had to register with IMDb so I could warn others. First there was the science of creating the shark-man which the movie barely touched on. In order to keep the viewers interested they just made sure there was blood every few minutes. During one attack scene the camera moved off of the attack but you saw what was apparently a bucket of blood being thrown by a stagehand to let you know that the attack was bloody and the person was probably dead (what fabulous special effects). Back to the science I thought it was very interesting that the female test subjects were held naked and the testing equipment required that they be monitored through their breast tissue. Anyway this movie had poor plot development terrible story and I'm sorry to say pretty bad acting. Not even William Forsythe Hunter Tylo or Jeffrey Combs could save this stinker. ,neg
 In Holland a gay writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) gives a lecture. He stays overnight with a beautiful woman Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (by imagining she's a boy). He plans to leave the next day but gets a look at a picture of Christine's hunky boyfriend Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay to have a try at him. Then things get strange. A big X-rated art house hit in the US in 1983. Why was it X rated? Let's see...there's strangulation full frontal male and female nudity castration mutilation simulated sex a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people a gay sex scene in a crypt...and it's all a comedy!!!!! Paul Verhoeven made this after Spetters . Spetters was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash. So Verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it. He was right! Critics loved the film not realizing that Verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. Still it's a great film. It's beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there's so much symbolism and obvious hidden layers in the dialogue that you're never bored. All the acting is great--Krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but (somehow) has you rooting for him; Soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection--the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body--he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with Krabbe in the crypt. This is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! A 10 all the way. ,pos
 I didn't mind all the walking. People really did walk places back then. It loaned an air of authenticity to this period piece and some perspective on the technology of the Martians. I too was disappointed by the effects in particular the Thunderchild scene which I regard as one of the most exciting in the book. But I can't praise this film enough for its faithfulness to Wells's story! It's about time. The actors are likable and the performances are charming. Also this film is very much worth seeing just to hear Jamie Hall's truly great musical score. It was interesting to see the same actor play both the writer and his brother in London. ,pos
 I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I shouldn't have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt Clark's worst film There is so much wrong with this film. First off some of the acting is great in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully' and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name) but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'Kids' but in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually. The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student. No sorry a high school student...one who has never seen a movie before. And I couldn't fathom Clark's intentions. Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence? It sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv. I'm no prude but I didn't need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that Clark's best film is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I don't think he'll ever top it. ,neg
 This 1939 film from director John Ford and writer Lamar Trotti tells a fictional tale of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln his trials (literally) and his tribulations. It's a sentimental film reasonably well made but hardly breathtaking. The casting of Henry Fonda as Lincoln seems a mistake for while the actor had the right doleful qualities for the part even with several inches of makeup and a false nose he's way too handsome for Honest Abe who was famously homely. It's a good try from Fonda who's nothing if not sincere but his miscasting throws the entire film off. The supporting cast is excellent though and includes Alice Brady Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is too reverential in his treatment of Lincoln who is presented as just shy of a saint and in the final scene the movie goes way over the top. ,pos
 Not so many people like the movies of Bertrand blier simply because they don't understand them. Simply because they are different kinds of people. If you have not been living under a deep desperation intertwined with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor blier shown here. And also the film of blier cannot be classified easily as black-comedy or cult etc. like those of pulp fiction etc. Because there is this delicacy which the audience of north-america frequently fail to appreciate. When I looked at these two `hooligans' dining with Jeanne moreau in the seaside restaurant I felt they were more gentil than any gentleman can have been. The urge to make love wildly like these is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being-symbolized by the camion suddenly emerges at the Carrefour. SO les valseuses is much better a name than going places. To dance a valse you need to be elegant but going places you don't. ,pos
 I can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad. It's like the TV station are desperate for anything anything at all. They're buried underneath a bunch of snow the electricity constantly flashes on and off yet magically there is a background light that stays constant. Where does all this (fake) light come from? That and all that stupid bickering between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive. It tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping. But because it's such bad directing and acting you will not your Florence Nightingale fix with this flick sorry. I'm joining the negative feedback and I concur that this is one of the worst movies ever. ,neg
 i should qualify that title now that i think about it. Checkout is not entirely worthless. i've had the opportunity to see it twice and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie's expense. so i guess it's worth something for that. and also it's worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing. as another reviewer pointed out this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word. not a single original thought went into this movie (which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me). the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie. it is definitely not the next Clerks it is definitely not original and it is absolutely not good clean fun. the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated (after seeing it a first time the second time can be quite funny in an insulting sort of way). as i looked around the theater it was obvious that nearly everyone barring perhaps the elderly were completely bored or pained by this movie. during some of the particularly emotional scenes like where Nick chews out his mother the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done. i even heard someone *groan* in the theater something i had heretofore never witnessed. i don't care where you have the chance to see this movie be it at a film festival or in a indie theater or wherever. do yourself a favor skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you're like me and just can't resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made. ,neg
 Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And by doing so killing her family friends and her enemies. Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian Japanese and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review. The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not don't see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk too much guy talk and lots of 'Oh my gosh. It's our prom'. I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting cheap scares and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film. 1 star out of 10. (P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would). ,neg
 You know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably? When you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen? House of the Dead struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema. From start to end House of the Dead manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size (which they exploit shamelessly) whereas the males for their hardcore kick-ass attitude. I honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. At least then we'll get better actingÂ… However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film. It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as: These are zombies pure and simple and No cap'n we must not go there! It's evil! . We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning; at best they are a harmless two hours of action blood and closet terror. Trash yes but entertaining trash. Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins. According to IMDb House of the Dead received such bad reviews that no Danish cinemas bought the movie. If only we could have had the same privilege. Final Score: 1/10. ,neg
 I was very surprised with this film. I was touched with the lives that paulie touched along his way to find his marie the little girl he was separated from. The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do. Actually i was expecting paulie wants a cracker jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when paulie is in the research lab press room conference. So if you wish to see a good animal that talks film check this one out much better than Dr. DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprised twist in the end that is done very nicely as well. ,pos
 The Sensuous Nurse (1975) was a Italian sexual comedy that starred the one time Bond girl Ursula Andress. Man was she hot in this movie.. She was stacked and built like a *@#% brick house. Ursula was smoking hot in this movie. I have never seen a nurse's outfit that filled out before. Ms. Andress stars as a nurse who is hired to take care of a rich elderly man. Even one in the house seems to be knocking the boots. One night the nurse decides to take the grandson's temperature and give some needed T.L.C. to her ancient client. The old man takes to his nurse and this angers the rest of the family. What kind of job did the family hire her out to do? Will the geezer fall for her car giver? How can she deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family? To find out you need to find a copy of the SENSUOUS NURSE!! Italian but badly dubbed into English. Highly recommended. ,pos
 What a perfect example of Less Is More... Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) only has 72 lines and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks the facial expressions the physical drama the emotive gesture all combines to make a stronger impact. This is one of those top 5 movies I can't live without right up there with the classics like Road Warrior. If you liked this check out Mad Max 2 The Road Warrior and Braveheart both starring Mel Gibson. Also Gladiator with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who was in Soldier also. The Thirteenth Warrior starring Antonio Banderas and Blade Runner starring Harrison Ford. ,pos
 I rented this DVD for two reasons. A cast of great actors and the director even though Robert Altman can be hit or miss. In this case it was a big miss. Altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester. After seeing Kenneth Branagh in a good film like Dead Again I didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey and I hope it didn't ruin his reputation. Robert Duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one-time Oscar winners. On a downward spiral that includes acting in eating-money films such as this one. Duvall was once a great actor in excellent films even though his best performance was not Tender Mercies but The Great Santini . This movie was truly a big waste of time. I give it a 2 out of 10. ,neg
 This movie had to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The acting was terrible Horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again nor will I recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First as soon as the movie began I realized what I got myself into. All they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie. The prank phone calls halloween night a psycho and one knife! Its absolutely ridiculous. I was not scared at all during the movie which I thought horror movies were supposed to do. As for the making of the movie its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary. I mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of Scary Movie for example. At least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror movie. ,neg
 When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death this was the first of his many films I thought of re-seeing. What a wonderful droll commentary the film provides even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame. His eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears. Both he and the film have to be considered lifetime favorites. ,pos
 this movie is a very relaxed romantic-comedy which is thoroughly enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as the genius niece of Albert Einstein though she does believe in her own skills. Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she comes into his shop with her fiancÃ© after her car stuffs up. I loved Walter Matthau as the one and only Albert Einstein. This movie just has a very relaxing feel to it while still keeping some sort of seriousness to it (if that is actually possible it happens here). I personally found this movie extremely entertaining especially the old scientists - i thought they were fab and hilarious! This movie seems to have been underestimated beyond comprehension. If you have a cheeky sense of humour this is the movie for you! ,pos
 Finally a movie where the audience is kept guessing until the end what will happen. Well we all kind of know that the lives of the brothers Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hank (played by Hawke) will spiral downward towards destruction since where else is there to go but down but we do not know how or when until near the end of the movie. Hoffman is superb as usual and even Hawke was decent as the younger brother who basically does what he is told since he really cannot think for himself. Hawke might have been a little out of his element but he played the part well enough. Add into this mix Andy's wife played perfectly by Marisa Tomei cheating with Hank; Andy's embezzlement of company funds to pay for his drug and sex addictions; and a father who finally discovers exactly what happened the day of the robbery. This movie will get you thinking. ,pos
 Before films like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ' 'Suspiria ' and 'Halloween' changed the view of horror forever there was a more Gothic and far less violent era in the genre. Films like the Hammer Horror series and 'Rosemary's Baby' were what scared and thrilled audiences throughout the 60s and early 70s. I can't tell you how many times I rented this film during my childhood but I did because there was something about it. I didn't want to limit myself to the slasher and zombies movies of the 70s and 80s and films like this production from the famous but sadly long gone Amicus film company were a good start. Pros: A grand eerie music score. Strong performances from a stellar cast. Brilliant cinematography. Plenty good old fashioned thrills and chills especially in the first and last vignettes. Some haunting moments and images. Moves at a slow but stead pace. The house is one spooky oppressive dwelling. Great production design and set decoration which give the film a real old Gothic horror feel. Depends more on mood and bloodless chills than on gore and gratuitous nudity for it's thrills. Cons: Some pacing issues in the first half. Aside from the 'The Cloak ' the rest of the stories feel like they've been done before. ClichÃ©s galore. The second story 'Waxworks ' has fine acting and it's moments but is the weakest of the four in terms of scares and suspense. The low budget really shows at times. Final thoughts: After seeing this film for the first time in many years I can see why I rented it so frequently. It's not a masterpiece by any means but it's a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class. Watch this one with the lights off. My rating: 3.5/5 ,pos
 First off let's start with the negative points: 1) There are HUGE gaping wholes in the story line and questions that are raised that will get no where near being answered; 2) The movie is not for all people so impolite viewers will get restless and start yapping during the movie. Point two above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older type theater (like the one I went to) you can hear the reel going through the projector at times. I loved that. The movie does not keep you busy with music nor effects: it lets you reflect upon what is happening. There is a lack of rhythm that generates an atmosphere that is fascinating an utterly enjoyable. The same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. I would highly recommend it to fans of cinema as the cinematographic work is amazing. Those that base their appreciation of a movie solely on the story will be utterly disappointed. It's the kind of story that you have to make up the links in your mind afterwards. (My version of it is pretty darn cool but probably quite off-track!) If you do go catch the movie there is one very cool part: when the two cops are talking to each other on their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really puts you in the moment. Hats off to the person that thought of doing this. ,pos
 This film was absolutely awful I even feel uncomfortable calling it a film. Its the typical mumblecore movie with zero plot and a bunch of aimless whiny twenty somethings stumbling around trying to figure stuff out . I have tried to give mumblecore a chance but lets be honest its just horrible. I am not out of sync with cinema I appreciate Dogme95 films Idioterne is one of my all time favorite films. So I do not mind if a film is cheaply made so long as there is some (ANY) substance. Everything in this film is horrid the acting the writing (or was it all improvised?) the direction but MOST of all above everything else the camera work was just plain and simple nonsense. The camera was never anywhere logical there was no consistency. I got to admit being a guy I had heard there was nudity in this film so I thought to myself well even if its horrible at least there's nudity (yea I know I'm a jerk). Well thanks to the uber crappy camera-work you never really get to see anything and the things you do see TRUST ME - YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE. This film made me want to vomit on numerous levels. The dialogue made me want to vomit the camera-work made me want to vomit but mostly the idea that this film was praised by some legit critics well now that more than anything makes me want to vomit. ,neg
 Let me just say I loved the original Boogeyman. Sure it's a flawed clichÃ©d 80s horror movie but hey those types are fun to watch! And plus it gave us something a bit different. So I gladly bought it and to my surprise this movie came along with it (only copy they had actually) so I thought Eh what the hell and bought it. Mistake #1. So that night I felt in the mood to watch a movie (I actually bought tons that day) and figured this was the shortest out of all the ones I bought so I'll just watch this and hit the sack. Mistake #2. Yes I have heard how bad it was but I was willing to take a chance. So a few minutes into the movie and there's the first flashback. I think nothing of it at first. Then the new footage with the prediction of the chick in the bathtub and I'm kinda liking the direction it's going in. Then the next flashback which is a bit longer and I'm sitting there thinking Yes I've seen the first Boogeyman! I know what happens so move along! Then the next one comes up and I figure screw it and fast forward through it. Then the final one (Maybe I fast forwarded through the explanation but why was she lying topless on the mirror? At least she could've shown them!) and I decide to fast forward through it and then the climax and the movie was over! WTF? What happened to the prediction stuff? What happened to the long hair dude (Did he tap that or what?)? And more importantly what kind of weed was the writer and director smoking when making this awful POS??!!! And what was the point? Was Annie just having flashbacks of what happened in the first movie? Or was the stuff from the first movie just happening at the same time as this? The latter could make sense because the stabbing of Pantyhose Face happened in 1978 according to the characters in this movie and it was 15 years later. Wait a minute no it wouldn't! Because Lacey (who the movie questionably renamed Nancy! Is Uli too dumb to remember his movie characters' names?) would be 20 years old since she was 5 when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks 30ish but also has a kid who looks around 7 and 10! Did she get around during middle school? And also why would Pantyhose be after Annie? What connection does she even have with the characters of the original movie? And a BIG HUGE MOVIE MISTAKE I found in this movie is that when the doctor is writing in his notebook does anyone notice that he's just SCRIBBLING? Wow how professional Doc! So what is the explanation for all of the questions I asked above? IT'S A POINTLESS MOVIE WITH NO THOUGHT PUT INTO IT AT ALL! I will try to find a copy of the original movie that comes with just that movie and that's it (Maybe a couple of extra features any Special Edition of it yet?). Then I will return this DVD and hopefully this review and all the others will prevent those who haven't seen it from seeing it thus making movie stores get rid of it and this movie may not exist anymore! Please let that be so! Sorry this review is so long. I'm just angry at this movie I had to vent somehow ,neg
 I don't think I'll ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin. 'Die Hard 2' was cool and he gave the world 'Cliffhanger' one of the most awesome action movies ever. That's right you little punks 'Cliffhanger' rules and we all know it. Sly plays Gabe Walker a former rescue climber who is 'just visiting' his old town when he is asked to help a former friend Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker) assist in a rescue on a mountain peak. Walker obviously came back at a convenient time because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U.S. government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back... Essentially 'Cliffhanger' is another 'Die Hard' clone. Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal. Naturally that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough as Stallone's character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease and slams face-first into several rock faces with no apparent side-effects. After all isn't that what action movies are all about? 'Cliffhanger' is one of the most exciting action movies around. A showcase of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning it maintains its action awesomeness. John Lithgow's lead villain is entertaining and one bad dude. Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever. 'Cliffhanger' is easily one of Stallone's best efforts definitely Renny Harlin's best effort and a very exciting action movie - 9/10 ,pos
 I believe that The Sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it. i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes so far the best one is definitely episode #3 Denial Anger Acceptance. This episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver. Brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang. In the end he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath and that's my most favorite scene ever in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. And my # 2 most favorite character ever was Matthew Bevilaqua who was killed after attempting to murder Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him. My # 3 most favorite character is Sean Gismonte who was killed right after shooting Christopher. And finally my # 4 most favorite character is Chucky Signore one of Uncle Junior's henchmen. He was killed on a boat by Tony. All the awesome characters are dead. That's the only bad thing about the Sopranos. All the cool guys always get killed. You know what would be great to change about the Sopranos? They should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture Chris Tony Uncle Junior Silvio and Paulie because they need to get their revenge. Brendan Filone shall strike back!!!!!!!!!1 ,pos
 Her Deadly Rival (1995): Starring Harry Hamlin Annie Potts Lisa Zane Tommy Hinkley Susan Diol Roma Maffia Robert C. Treveiler D. L. Anderson William Blair Sean Bridges Robin Dallenbach Wilbur Fitzgerald Dale Frye Stan Kelly Deborah Hobart David Lenthall Lorri Lindberg Chuck Kinlaw Amy Parrish Melissa Suzanne McBride Ralph Wilcox Al Wiggins Jeff Sumerel Daria Sanford....Director James Hayman Screenplay Dan Vining. Actor Harry Hamlin (of LA Law fame Clash of The Titans and other films) seems perfectly cast in this Lifetime type film directed by James Hayman and released in 1995. He and his wife Lisa Rinna would later work on a film about sex addiction. Her Deadly Rival is at first glance similar to the better known Hollywood box-office hit Fatal Attraction . In Rival happily married couple Jim and Kris Lanford move into a new home in the typically beautiful suburbs. They have the seemingly perfect marriage- they are deeply in love despite a routine lifestyle. But then a mysterious admirer sets her eyes on Jim. Her identity is never revealed despite an attempt by Jim and even investigators to discover who she is. She constantly harasses Jim through phone calls and letters. His marriage nearly flounders as his wife begins to think he's having an affair and trying to cover it up. While Harry Hamlin Annie Potts and the rest of the cast - Lisa Zane Tommy Hinkley Susan Diol Roma Maffia Robert C. Treveiler D. L. Anderson William Blair- each seem to be straight out of a soap opera. But this is a very suspense-filled drama and has its good moments. There is a twist at the end. Spoiler Alert. All I have to say is her deadly rival was only herself. Based on a supposedly actual case Jim's wife Kris suffered from multiple personality disorder and that was what ruined her marriage. Even if the story is not terribly impressive even if the acting is only a step above soap opera acting this film has its moments. Especially moving are the intimate scenes between Jim and his wife and the final scene in which when Jim learns the truth he can't believe what he has just heard. The movie is probably a little too long and boring in some parts but it's the kind of TV movie that usually does well especially on Lifetime which continues to produce films of this kind of the domestic thriller type or seduction stories. Trashy but everyone likes trash. ,pos
 Film version of Sandra Bernhard's one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious. Sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting and fitfully funny. Her fans will say she's scathingly honest and that may be true. But she's also shrill with an unapologetic in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre. She doesn't want to make nice--and she's certainly not out to make friends--and that's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way. But even if you meet her halfway her material here is seriously lacking. Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and though not directed by him the film does have his chilly detached signature style all over it. Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich; their oddest touch was in having all of Sandra's in-house audiences looking completely bored--a feeling many real viewers will most likely share. *1/2 from **** ,neg
 It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (maffia-like) character of Russians or at least of those Russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that British police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. In addition Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains but far to be the Russian one. So Nicole if you really want to talk Russian kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning Russian language grammar and its pronunciation. ,neg
 Here's the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching. And mostly it's for two reasons. One it concentrates of young people VERY young people. People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are. All of us have been there in our lives and The Man in the Moon is a magnificent reflection upon our memories maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced. The second reason is that is a love triangle. And I do believe that as teens it's the most dramatic. And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs will believe it for the rest of their lives. The cast of The Man in the Moon is full of great talented names. It stars Sam Waterston who is truly a versatile actor well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict yet caring and wise fathers as in this film. Also there is Tess Harper Jason London and a young young Reese Witherspoon. You look at the young talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road she's going to win the Academy Award. All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations. As if it all really happened. This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often. Love story or not. I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way. ,pos
 Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The plot was senseless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie this isn't one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide. That would have been more entertaining. ,neg
 I think that people are under estimating this incredible film. People are seeing it as a typical horror movie that is set out to scare us and prevent us from getting some sleep. Which if it was trying to do then it would deservedly get a 1/10 but i viewed this film with a few friends and we found it very entertaining and though it was a good movie after all it does have Stephanie beaton. This is the reason why i think that it deserves the 10/10 for the pure entertainment of the film. The general view on this movie is that it has bad acting a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cant be taken seriously and people are rating it low because of this. But i see this as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece...that has a hilariously funny script which is made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious it is very entertaining. ,pos
 The Last Big Thing is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically whips pop culture to the point of humorous self-desctruction. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at/sympathize with. Which brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked best... Simon Geist is a man in his late 30s/early 40s who creates a pop-culture driven editorial magazine called The Next Big Thing . Thing is this magazine doesnt really exist and it is only an excuse for Simon to get close to actors by interviewing them only to bitch-slap them silly insulting their way of buying into pop culture. His live-in female friend Darla is also writing a magazine (which is real) which mainly has to do with her and Simon as well as her and her father. Darla is a genuinely loveable (or loathable) character depending on how you view her muted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute the character i liked the best. Brent is a flat character with not much to him as is Tedra the music-video queen for a bunch of B-rated rock bands. Still these characters weave a very interesting web together. And this movie questions all the motivations that people have for what they do and why they do it. Its a wonderful film and I suggest you see it if you're in the indie/art house crowd. Mark my words! ,pos
 *Warning - no plot spoilers ahead but movie spoilers nonetheless...* My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast. Wow - very very wrong. This movie is an overdone overwrought and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot! The copyright date on the box said 2005 yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s/early 90s dresses and hairdos. It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film! I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback and therefore supposed to look old but it looked WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s... then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences (yet it's a different much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks). I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie! It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up (and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes). Thus this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time. The shell story shot in 2005 is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead (something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005?) These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichÃ©d action that permeates the new movie. Don't bother. There's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - it's terrible. ,neg

 I'm allowed to write 1000 words about this film but one word could suffice: bizarre. Hubby and I didn't laugh so much as gawk at this truly dreadful movie. We kept looking at each other with our best What the...? expressions. There is no way to adequately describe this movie. Killer tomatoes were funny but this is just sick. What kind of mind produces images like these and then puts them on film for others to see? What kind of mind includes innocent children in this weird weird movie and then packages it as if it is appropriate for children? Parents whatever you do if your child still believes in Santa don't let him/her see this movie. Preteens can watch it -- probably with What the...? expressions on their faces. If you decide to inflict this movie on others you might want to spike their eggnog. Quite possibly the worst film ever made. ,neg
 Nahhh! Leila (Grace Mills) is a teenager turned on to Satan (and LSD) by her archaeologist fiancÃ© Richard. There's a neighborhood hippie demon cult hanging out at the local decrepit ancient castle where Leila and Richard drink blood drop drugs join in sex orgies dance to lame psychedelic rock and participate in black mass ceremonies where the guys wear pants masks and capes and the women don't wear anything at all. Unfortunately these kind of extracurricular activities have left Leila open to demonic possession from the dreaded spirit of evil. Leila also comes from a screwed up family which doesn't help either. Her older brother John is a recluse who seems to be in love with her. Her mother Patricia (Maria Perschy) is depressed because she thinks she was responsible for the father's death. To top it off her sister (Maria Kosti) is a slutty semi pro golfer named (gasp!) Debbie Gibson. There's plenty of hired help around also to waste more time. Two maids (a young one who takes her clothes off a lot and an old one who spies on everyone) plus Udo (Luis Induni) a bald voyeuristic handyman who spies on Leila changing clothes takes nude pictures of her and sneaks into the pool house to take a sniff of her freshly used bathing suit. Oh yeah and Borg the pet German Shepherd. Paul Naschy is Father Adrian Dunning the doubting priest (zzzzz) who starts snooping around after John and Richard both have their heads twisted around backwards. Leila tells him They say I am perverse and I'm going to prove it is true! During her birthday party she tells her guests You make me sick! I hate you all! and when mom suggests having a doctor come over she she screeches I don't want to see that fat ass! Debbie suggests they commit Leila to a sanitory but Leila runs off and joins the cult again. She is rescued (again) and brought back home (for the third time). By this point in the movie there's only about ten minutes left to go and all we've basically seen is some very boring scenes of characters talking and whining about how terrible and f-ed up their lives are and how Leila is acting weird. It's almost as agonizing to sit through as an Andy Milligan movie minus the gore and laughs. But finally during the last few minutes we get the movie the title implies - an EXORCIST-like possession flick. Unfortunately the best part of it are the contact lenses Leila gets to wear. Some cheap time-lapse slashes appear on her arms legs and face she gets scabby lips and her eyes take on the appearance of blue and white marbles. She begins reeking of rotted flesh spits up some clear gunk starts speaking in her dead dad's voice sneaks into her mom's bedroom slaps her around a bit and calls her a filthy bitch of a whore. In comes Father Adrian who now finally believes she is indeed possessed fends off her attempts at seduction hallucinates frogs and eels are in the kitchen and douses Leila with holy water. Doors open and close a mirror breaks there's sudden thunder and her bed rises up off the floor. After she tackles Dunning and the two roll down the stairs the spirit is out of her and into - guess who? Why Borg the family pooch! The demon dog then turns on Adrian and chews him up a little before he impales it on a fire poker. Then we get one of the most irritating final shots ever committed to film. It's Leila on the floor going from her hideous appearance back to her normal sexy self. But then there's ANOTHER time-lapse effect that sort of seems to suggest that the demon has possibly reentered her body. It's so badly done you really have no clue what to make of it which is the final slap in the face to anyone who has just realized they've wasted an hour and a half on this worthless POS. Screw the contacts 1 out of 10 it is. ,neg
 I could not believe how awful this film was; I rarely watch commercial TV but thought Well Diane Keaton is always worth watching . I stand corrected. Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame. I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age but the script to this was so inept clichÃ©d and baffling that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable. The acting looked like exercises in a BEGINNING class - I stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering What were they thinking? . Very very sad that it has come to this. Don't waste your time. ,neg
 I did not see this film in the theater. I confess to an anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who the hell was John Travolta to be making movies? I remember the Oscar broadcast that year with Travolta looking absolutely devastated when he didn't win. How dare he when there were real actors in the running? I'm sorry John you should have won. After catching this film on cable years ago I fell in love with the entire movie. Bud Sissy Uncle Bob Wes all wonderfully done. I also confess to never passing it by when I channel surf. I HAVE to stop and watch. Over the years I've learned to do most of the dialogue dance with my thumbs in my waistband and learned to appreciate Travolta more. The only disappointing thing to me was the oversight on the soundtrack of some of the music from Urban Cowboy. Looking for love defines the film but Urban Cowboy was chock full of classics that DIDN'T make it to the soundtrack. It should have been a double CD........ ,pos
 its not as good as the first movie but its a good solid movie its has good car chase scenes on the remake of this movie there a story for are hero to drive fast as his trying to rush to the side of his ailing wife the ending is great just a good fair movie to watch in my opinion  ,pos
 This movie was beautiful. It was full of memorable imagery good acting and touching subject matter. It would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve. I was totally involved in the story's unfolding and presentation. There were a few cheesy shots but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film. The only complaint I can conjure is there wasn't a ton of details. However this movie wasn't created to explain every element of Joseph Smith's life ministry triumphs controversies failures etc.; it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time. ,pos
 As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOGS and Kubrick with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE director John Boorman delivers an effective film about Man's violent side in DELIVERANCE arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds Jon Voight Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox portray four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild Cahulawassee River in northern Georgia before it is dammed up into what Reynolds calls one big dead lake. But the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these city boys carousing through their woods. And the following day continuing on down the river Beatty and Voight are accosted and sexually assaulted (the film's infamous SQUEAL! sequence) by two vicious mountain men (Bill McKinney Herbert Cowboy Coward). Thus what started out as nothing more than a lark through the Appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism. James Dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best-selling book and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker. Often known for its SQUEAL! and Dueling Banjos sequences DELIVERANCE is also quite a pulse-pounding ordeal with the four leading men superb in their roles and McKinney and Coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times. A must-see film for those willing to take a chance. ,pos
 ..Oh wait I can! This movie is not for the typical film snob unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions like continuity editing and geographic match . I couldn't tell where I was in this movie. One second they're in the present next minute their supposedly in the 70's driving a modern SUV and wearing what looked like to me as 80's style clothing. I think. I couldn't pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible. I think it only got attention because it has a 3d which I did not watch. If you're a b-movie buff and by b-movie I mean BAD movie then this film is for you. It's home-movie and all non-sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake. If your tastes are more for Goddard and Antonioni though just skip this one. ,neg
 A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between. As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to events in the film.

 (No spoilers just plot details) I can't understand such hatred for this episode. You want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Watch Subterranean - now there's a sack of crap. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I don't say that very often) and Michael Rosenbaum is great but he is most of the time. The alternate universe scenario seems eerily realistic. The Martian Manhunter who previously appeared in Static returns and tells Clark that the doctor that is the head of the insane asylum where they are being held at is actually a phantom from the phantom zone and if Clark wants to return to his universe he must kill him. An overall great episode with good acting and a decent pace. ,pos
 Let me begin by saying I am a big fantasy fan. However this film is not for me. Many far-fetched arguments are trying to support this film's claim that dragons possibly ever existed. The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries but fails to investigate them more thoroughly which could have given the film some credibility. The film uses (nice!) CGI to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon's life. This is combined with popular-TV-show-CSI-style flash-forwards to make it look like something scientific which it is definitely not. In many cases the arguments/clues are far-fetched. In some cases clues used to show dragons possibly existed or flew or spit fire are simply invalid. To see this just makes me get cramp in my toes. Even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it but this one just doesn't have it. Bottom line: it's a pretentious fantasy-CSI documentary not worth watching. ,neg
 Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90's I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the book on film! This version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it. Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. I was glad that they cast a normal looking actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not a glamorous person. I love the sets and the location. For anyone who is a true Jane Eyre fan this is the version to watch!!! For those of you who are interested I just found this version on DVD. I have watched my VHS copy almost to breaking so I was thrilled to find it on DVD. ,pos
 This is a great idea for a film but it unfortunately doesn't turn out to be a great movie. What starts out as a sweet and almost goofy romantic comedy about a Fluffer in love with his Fluffee spirals out of control into a bizarre combination of genres and a veritable stew of plots with liberal borrowings from BOOGIE NIGHTS THELMA AND LOUISE SHOWGIRLS FRISK and even a curious dash of 400 BLOWS thrown in towards the end. (At least the director did his research!) The result is not necessarily boring but in the end this slick well-produced flick doesn't quite add up to anything. However the actors all do a game job with the material and there are a few good laughs at the behind-the-scenes world of gay porn. ,neg
 I remember when this piece of trash came out all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken Barbra Streisand years to get the film made. Well it couldn't have taken that many years; the play only opened in 1975 eight years previously. It made a Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh who probably should have been cast in the film but NOOOOO...the Great STAR BARBRA HAD TO DO IT HER WAY. AND WITH MUSIC NO LESS! This film is a total disaster from start to finish. For one thing Barbra was FORTY YEARS OLD when she made it and she looked every minute of it. There was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study Torah. And then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy. I get the impression that Streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make-up; she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl. And as if that is not bad enough she gets involved with both her schoolmate Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end) AND his fiancÃ©e (Amy Irving who does her usual sleepwalker routine a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing). Yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl; I won't even bother to mention the wedding night scene. Then there is the music. Nine totally forgettable songs all sung by Streisand via voice-over (presumably as a look inside her mind) and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard. I won't say that Streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here; some of the visuals are lovely (Patinkin's backside especially) and she has a good eye for balance. The problem with this movie is that she won't get out of her own way. I did not believe her for one second in the title role; she should NEVER have added the songs and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes. I was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty-five minutes. Awful awful awful. ,neg
 This is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple. The movie portrais a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion infidelity juggling work and family. The so called culture of death that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think. A must see. I hope it gets distributed as it should. Congratulations on the cast and director. Two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me! ,pos
 This movie contains one of Richard Dreyfuss's greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor. Also this movie is funny yet has a serious side as well. What is especially intriguing about this movie is the character Madonna who is the dictator's mistress but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Madonna's evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movie's entertainment value. And the main character who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon evolves too and by the end of the movie commands respect. I liked this movie. ,pos
 Carriers follows the exploits of two guys and two gals in a stolen Mercedes with the words road warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car. Brian (Chris Pine of Star Trek ) is driving and his girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo of Coyote Ugly )has shotgun while Brian's younger brother Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci of Fanboys ) and his friend--not exactly girlfriend--Kate (Emily VanCamp of The Ring 2 ) occupy the backseat. This quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare. Apparently a viral pandemic--which co-directors & co-scenarists Alex Pastor and David Pastor tell us absolutely nothing about--has devastated America. Naturally the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies. This lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die. Most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band. Initially this foursome encounters a desperate father Frank (Christopher Meloni of Runaway Bride ) and his cute little daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka of Land of the Lost ) blocking the highway with their SUV. Brian swerves around Frank when he tries to waylay them but in the process the oil pan in their Mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot. Reluctantly they hitch a ride with Frank after they seal Jodie up in the rear of the SUV. She wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood. Frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it. Sadly somebody has lied to Frank. The hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some Kool-Aid that will put them out of their misery. The cure did not improve their condition. Everybody else in town is dead. Kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone. Frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his SUV and take off. Indeed Carriers qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves. They reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump-action shotguns. Incredibly our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot but Brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse. Eventually they discover that one of them has become infected. Later as they are about to run out of gas Brian blocks the highway like Frank did at the outset. Danny tries to stop a pair of older Christian women driving the car. Danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help. Brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them. Brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger but he kills her. No Carriers is not a beer & pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non-existent. By the end of this 84-minute movie our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight. Chris Pine makes quite an impression as fun-loving Brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum while the only other well-known actress Piper Perabo is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role. As Bobby she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price. It is a testament to Pine's performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others. Essentially Pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one-eighty from happy-go-lucky guy to heartless guy. The two directors are Spanish brothers and they never let the momentum flag. Since there is no relief in sight Carriers sinks into predictability. IrrÃ©versible cinematographer BenoÃ®t Debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes Debie makes it look like a dynamic film. Aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word Carriers suffers because it is so horribly cynical. The scene when the German shepherd attacks Danny conjures up the most suspense but even it could have been improved. Unfortunately the Pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense. By fade-out you really don't care what happens to anybody. ,neg
 Plot Synopsis: When his wife a news reporter is kidnapped & replaced with an android double Secret Service agent Eric Phillips tracks her down & uncovers a plan by an arms dealer to create an army of invincible androids to assassinate world leaders. I wasn't expecting much when I first saw this sequel to Richard Pepin's low-budget sci-fi / action hybrid Cyber Tracker . That film was nothing special not to mention a blatant rip-off of both The Terminator & RoboCop . This sequel is the same as before with an all-out action sequence opening the film. There are plenty of explosions heavy gunfire & a huge bodycount as well as some martial-arts moves courtesy of the film's star Don The Dragon Wilson. The whole film seems like a series of action scenes strung together with minimal plot. On the acting front Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality transplant. ,neg
 When i looked at this years Wrestlemania's match card i was SO stoked and unable to control myself because i was full of excitement. It starts...and it ends. I'm sitting there angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back. I mean you watch Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then. The one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when HBK tapped out!!!! That very moment of HBK losing to JOHN CENA!!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser/poser. It almost ruined Wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat TRIPLE H! I couldn't watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to watch it again (luckily). I again have faith in WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the greatest i have ever seen) which was a pure classic Wrestlemania. It definitely made up for 'Mania 23 and gave us lots of memorable moments as well. If you have watched ANY of the Wrestlemanias before this one like the ones that turn you into fans (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan) PLEASE don't watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave WWE behind. And if you DO watch it and are angry start watching it again and watch Wrestlemania 24 it is absolutely classic. ,neg
 If it's action and adventure you want in a movie then you'd be best advised to look elsewhere. On the other hand if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go along with that mood check out The Straight Story. Richard Farnsworth puts on a compelling performance as the gentle and gentlemanly Alvin Straight in this true story of Alvin's journey on a riding mower across three states to see his estranged brother who has had a stroke. Farnsworth is perfect in this role as he travels his long and winding road making friends of strangers and doling out lots of grandfatherly type advice about family along the way. The story moves along as slowly as the riding mower but somehow manages to keep the viewer watching waiting for the next life lesson Alvin's going to offer. Stretch out on the couch relax and enjoy. It's the only way to watch this very good movie which rates a 7/10 in my book. ,pos
 Ok even if you can't stand Liza- this movie is truly hilarious! The scenes with John Gielgud make up for Liza. One of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century.

 The first thing I thought after watching Mystery Men was how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so adorable and funny that it's status as a bomb defies logic. Well I hope that in the future it becomes a cult hit and you can count me amoung it's fans. Simply put and without giving too much away this movie does for comic books what the Princess Bride did for fairy tales and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? did for classic cartoons. That should give you a more accurate idea of the tone of the movie then the marketing commitee it was unfortunately signed to (this is one of those cases like the Iron Giant where the studio had no clue what it had on it's hands). Rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little offbeat. You won't listen to the BeeGees in the same light ever again. ,pos
 This film is pretty poor. The acting is abysmal and completely forced. Furthermore by shooting the film as a docudrama doesn't necessarily make it more believable you can't get out of it that easily Mr Dir. Don't let my comments mislead you however as i would recommend you watch this film as it does shed some light on the psychology or non existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish! There is no other way to put it! It pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere! What takes place does not translate to me any feelings of desperation panic fear or dread that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances. No instead it leaves you with jaw dropping Was that it?! spilling from your tongue and by no means are you haunted by these boys actions. Rather you just feel embarrassed for yet another film that started with potential but ended up falling flat on its face at the most crucial point.Zero Day indeed....zzzzzzzzzzzzz ,neg
 RKO had a reputation for making folksy homespun pieces of Americana. Anne Shirley (as Dawn O'Day) had been in films since she was a toddler. By 1933 she was in limbo - having played Ann Dvorak as a child in Three on a Match (1932) and a flower girl in both This Side of Heaven and The Key both in 1934. George Nicholls Jnr remembered Anne's work from a previous film and that's how she got this part. She also adopted Anne Shirley as her stage name. The memorable stories are there - Lady of Shallot in a leaky boat the stolen brooch the red hair incident. Anne was so right for the role of the chatty heartwarming orphan. She was heartbreaking in her intensity her eagerness to please and also her fiery temper. O.P. Heggie was wonderful as the understanding Matthew Cuthbert and Helen Westley was fine as the firm Marilla. Tom Brown was an excellent Gilbert Blythe. Gertrude Messinger who had also been in films as a small child was fine as Diana Barry. Sara Haden proved she could play someone other than Aunt Millie in the Andy Hardy series was Mrs. Barry. ,pos

 Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films i've seen in the last ten years..Excellent performances(especially yiannis zouganelis is great) well-written script and effective direction from a very special for the Greek very average standards auteur. A film obviously influenced by Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end. Nevertheless this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of Greek movies which should be watched outside Greece. It's a shame that in Greece didn't work commercially in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like Politiki Kouzina.. ,pos
 This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a nice 'Parisien' atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm but in terms of a story.. well it's not really there. Or at least not very well worked out. The acting is also not so smooth by Caron. But I liked some of the dialogues I liked the scene at the Seine I liked the character played by Levant the colors; and the dancing of course which is quite magnificent. A 7.5 - 8 seems on the dot to me. ,pos
 i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations. the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good right? how wrong i was. i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director/writer of wiseguy making his feature debut = blah)... well the director/writer of Edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because i cannot see how he (along with the other actors in the film) would ever agree to be in this disaster. this movie is absolutely appalling! it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled clichÃ© ever. there is nothing new with Edison. the acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy. this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen. some examples of just bad silly moments in Edison... morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music... justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by candles... llcoolj driving a vintage firebird... 3 guys being shot in the head... this movie is the opposite of good. STAY AWAY FROM EDISON! ,neg
 This documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence in which Brian Flemming perhaps purposely fails to mention important evidence to the contrary. Perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest: His claims concerning the invalidity of Paul's testimony about Jesus Christ disregard key facts like: **The existence of some formulated creeds within Paul's letters. These creeds suggest that most of the central claims about Jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of Christ's death and resurrection. **The testimonies of the early Christians can't just be tossed out as mere fantasy. There were indeed many people claiming to be the Messiah during that period but only ONE of them has remained: Jesus. Why? Because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed Christ was the messiah and go on to die for those beliefs if they knew that he had not been resurrected. **Even if the Gospels are dated more liberally we are still talking about accounts of Jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these Gospels. And there is evidence that the Gospels were written much earlier. What I am saying is that Flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self-serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti-Christian view. Don't be fooled by poor investigation. ,neg
 The makers have chosen the best people for the job and set the scene wonderfully. Every interior is full of detail that tells you all about the people who live in it. Whether the period is the 20s (the first story) the present (ie 1950) for the middle story or the 1910s (the last) costumes and settings are lovingly observed and created. I love the fussy costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - exquisite lace overlaid by the finest Shetland shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very appealing but never mind the soppy young lovers it's Raymond Huntley as the man who resents his wife's health and independence who harrows our emotions. He usually played comical pompous types but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. The China Seas (great 30s film starring Gable and Harlow) stole the plot from the Mr Know All episode (and also nicked a story by Kipling). I wish we saw more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous husband - though he has a good moment looking melancholy in a Mexican hat. I love that posh bird who plays his wife too. ,pos
 This is quite literally the worst movie I have ever watched in my life. It may be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they're good; this movie is so bad that it goes past enjoyable camp and simply becomes unwatchably awful. It is the anti-enantiodromia. We bought it with the intent to heckle and all of my family gathered around for a fun evening of clever remarks; instead we sat in stunned silence pitying poor Peter Sellers. This is worse than the animated Lord of the Rings. It is worse than the Matrix sequels. It is worse than Krull. It is worse than any Batman movie. Do not under any circumstances let this movie approach within ten feet of your television. ,neg
 This movie was boring! Yes there are a few funny moments and jokes but you cannot base a whole movie on that! The characters are too stereotyped there is no real story - but short episodes with freaky side-characters who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine. Shame because most of the actors are acknowledged in Hungary a mystery why they took the roles. This is *not* a new hope for the Hungarian film. It was boring though it was meant to be genuine or unique. They could have tried much more harder than this... 2 out of 10 ,neg
 What makes for Best Picture material? The Oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come. It wasn't because Hollywood was against art or creativity. The Academy Awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative minds. The Arthur Freed unit at MGM had been bound for Oscar-winning glory for several years by this point; it was only a matter of time before Freed aided by his strongest director Vincente Minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a Best Picture. Freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals. The point about Freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of Hammerstein or Lerner don't have to tell or even relate to the stories. What's important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film. An American in Paris was the first of three Freed musicals (the other two being Singin' in the Rain and The Band Wagon) which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story. The words don't fit the plot but the routines fit the show. So when Gene Kelly sings I Got Rhythm he hasn't even got a girl yet but the way it's done with the French kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point. An American in Paris also uses the rule-breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of Leslie Caron's character. And what better director for this project than Minnelli himself a painter and a pianist? At this time there wasn't really anyone who had a better feel for Technicolor. While some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades Minnelli's colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced. In the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red. During Oscar Levant and Georges Guetary's meeting in the cafÃ© a few more vibrant shades are introduced. Then during the first musical number By Strauss Minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red Â– a table cloth a bunch of roses Â– until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the picture's colour scheme. For most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people. However in some numbers such as Tra-la-la he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated. The Achilles' heel of An American in Paris is its story. I personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s; the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero. Even if you don't mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances. Compare this to Singin' in the Rain which doesn't really have as many great routines or memorable set-pieces as An American in Paris but it has a winning storyline. Singin' in the Rain was overlooked at the 1952 Oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today. But I think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all-encompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story. An American in Paris is not deep or engaging or tear-jerking but like a certain DeMille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show. ,pos
 I just did not enjoy this film. But then I loved Babe a Pig in the City and have been spoiled by talking animal films that are exceptionally well done in every way. The animals were not likeable. They were all irritating especially Chris Rock's guinea pig but then what could I expect it's Chris Rock. I believe I smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines but that's it. ,neg
 In Rosenstrasse Margarethe von Trotta blends two stories to create a vibrant tapestry of love and courage. The film depicts a family drama of estrangement between a mother and her daughter and the story of German women who staged a protest on Rosenstrasse to free their Jewish husbands from certain extermination. In addition to the dramatization of historical events the focus of the film is on the saving of a child from the Holocaust by a German and the result of the child's experience of losing her mother. While Ms. von Trotta shows that the courage of a small number of Germans made a difference she does not use it to excuse German society. Indeed she shows how in the midst of torture and extermination the wealthy artists and intellectuals of German high society went on about their lives and parties oblivious to the suffering. Rosenstrasse opens in New York as a Jewish widow Ruth Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) decides to sit Shiva a seven-day period of mourning that takes place following a funeral in which Jewish family members devote full attention to remembering and mourning the deceased. When her daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) is forbidden to receive phone calls from her fiancÃ© Luis (Fedja van Huet) a non-Jew Hannah questions why her mother has suddenly decided to follow an Orthodox tradition that she previously rejected. When Ruth coldly rejects her cousin Hannah questions her and learns about a woman named Lena who took Ruth in as a child when the latter's mother was deported and murdered by the Nazis and she vows to find Lena and discover the secret of her mother's past. Her quest takes her to Berlin where she finds Lena (Doris Schade) now ninety years old and interviews her on the pretext that she is a journalist researching certain aspects of the Holocaust. With unfailing memory Lena tells her story of how as a young 33-year old woman (Katja Reimann) she searched for her husband Jewish pianist Fabian Israel Fischer (Martin Feifel) who disappeared and was presumed to have been imprisoned despite the protection normally given Jews in mixed marriages. Lena in a radiant performance by Reimann discovers that her husband and other Jews are being held prisoner in a former factory on the Rosenstrasse. Standing together in the freezing night German women whose husband are missing congregate outside the building their numbers growing daily until they reach one thousand shouting Give us back our husbands . Lena finds Ruth (Svea Lohde) a young girl whose mother is in the building. She takes care of her protecting her from the Gestapo and raising her after her mother is killed. Lena comes from an aristocratic German family and her brother recently returned from Stalingrad is a Wehrmacht officer. After being refused help from her father to free Fabian she enlists the aid of her brother who tells a fellow Officer I know what they do to the Jews. I saw it . Given his support she is bold enough to bypass channels and go to the top where her beauty and charm prove irresistible for the Minister of Culture Joseph Goebbels a known womanizer. While this fictional part of the film has been criticized as degrading to the women protesters it is a historical fact that Goebbels was very active in making the decisions affecting Rosenstrasse. The director Margarethe von Trotta an activist feminist and intellectual is no stranger to political drama. She directed a film about Socialist Rosa Luxembourg and Marianne and Julianne a story of the relationship between two sisters one of whom resorts to political violence to accomplish her liberal objectives. In Rosenstrasse a film she worked on for eight years she had to make compromises adding the present day fictional element in order to have her film produced. That it works so well is a tribute to Ms. von Trotta's artistry and the beautiful screenplay by Pamela Katz whose father was a refugee from Leipzig. The events at Rosenstrasse give the lie to Germans who say there was nothing we could do . Now von Trotta has shown the opposite to be true that something could be done to resist the Nazis. It is tragic that the example did not catch on. ,pos
 A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background contained the comment A woman's life is no more valuable than a man's . This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show. Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population sometimes with astonishing speed. Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914- 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed. In South America's War of the Triple Alliance (1865) Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia. No society however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population. Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight. Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier. G.I. Jane is Hollywood fluff. ,neg
 ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting Irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) went around claiming that he could beat any man alive. Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen. Raoul Walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of good humor. All the Warner contract players make up the fine cast--including the always reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn's rambunctious father proud of his son's fighting abilities and ALEXIS SMITH who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking Flynn down a peg with saucy one-liners dealing with his conceited manners. All of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious B&W although it's too bad Warners didn't have more faith in Flynn to do the film in color. He was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out. The fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen with Flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. And the scene where Bond turns over his award plaque to Flynn at a social gathering is one of Ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor. Summing up: Maintains interest all the way through whether you're a sports fan or not. ,pos
 Man To Man tries hard to be a good movie: it has its heart at the right place it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate. But there lies also some of the problems of this picture. It strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. So it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic - Man To Man doesn't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head. Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to look concerned genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer. Add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching. But there are enough points to defend it: it is entertaining has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas. Of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man (David Lynch) but you'll be leaving the theatre satisfied. It tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious) and succeeds most of the time. ,neg
 I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes although it's not much cop. Britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing. Rex Harrison seems even less bothered perhaps unsurprisingly as his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better but his screen time is fleeting and again his character is not well scripted. Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen but is given very little to do the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now). Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director and this is one of his weaker movies. ,neg
 Firstly I would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors. Anything that has a rating below 6/10 is clearly utter nonsense. Creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects. The actors are highly believable the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing. There is much mystique in this film. Many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels. How was 'Craig' created and what happened to him? A fantastic film with a large chill factor. A film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 Days Later The Bunker Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. Look forward to more of these fantastic films!! ,pos
 I have never seen a movie as bad as this. It is meant to be a fun movie but the only joke is at the start and it is NOT funny. If you like this sort of movie then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2. If it had the necessary votes it would truly belong on the bottom 100. ,neg
 This was excellent. Touching action-packed and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie it deserves more than 5.3 or so stars. This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns there is more to life than soldiering and people who learn that there is a time for fighting a need to defend. I cried laughed and mostly sat in awe of this story. Good writing job for an action flick and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid. The ending wasn't twisty but it was still excellent. If you like escape from New York or rooting for the underdog this movie is for you. Not an undue amount of gore or violence it was not difficult to watch in that respect. Something for everyone. ,pos
 This movie is incredible. If you have the chance watch it. Although a warning you'll cry your eyes out. I do every time I see it and I own it and have watched it many times. The performances are outstanding. It deals with darkness and pain and loss but there is hope. This movie made me look at the world differently: vicarious experience according to my English teacher. Also if you've seen it note the interesting use of shadows and light. Home room is a phenomenal movie and I rate it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent acting amazing plot and heart-wrenching dialogue. Very tense very moving. Doesn't give all the answers but makes many good points about humankind ,pos
 ''Ranma Â½ is my favorite anime by Rumiko Takahashi. The woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story that is not only a comedy but also an action anime. The main character of the story is Ranma Saotome a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts. Ranma is engaged to Akane because of an arrangement of both fathers who are great friends and trained together during many years. Akane is the younger and most violent sister of the Tendo's: Kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and Nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what. Ranma and Akane fight all the time specially because both have a very bad temper and when they discover that Ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda many new characters and situations starts to happen. They also discover the reason of the transformation: while fighting Ranma and his father fell in a cursed river. But not only them had this kind of fate... If you watched ''Ranma 1/2'' and liked I would recommend you ''Inuyasha'' and ''Maison Ikkoku two other good creations from Rumiko's hands. ,pos
 Sure for it's super imagery and awesome sound it's a great home theater show off disk but this is also a touching drama as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories that are intertwined throughout this film will keep all viewers interested. Young old boys and girls alike will find that deep down we are all fans of the automobile especially the high performance indy machines that are the result of generations blood sweat tears ingenuity and perseverance. The Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder sound track is perfectly matched to the visuals and the content. I don't want to give away the ending but the final driving sequence to Quincy Jones' Days Like These just might bring a tear to your eye. Enjoy it! ,pos
 For 50 years after world war 2 the United States was in a state where key segments of the economy were dominated by military interests. At the same time because of the draft and wars everyone in society had served or was connected to someone who had. This allowed for a minigenre based on the notion of American cleverness in the midst of an inflexible military machine. Sometimes that machine was non-US military for example in prisoner of war situations. Once removed are stories in other machines: science fiction and corporate but they always reference this military genre and indeed the testosterone shots of action even reference their comic sibling. You can trace it I think perhaps starting in the comic meaning Amrican sections of The Great Escape which immediately spawned TeeVee offspring in Gomer Pyle and Hogan's Heros. Then a second wave triggered by Catch 22 and MASH both of which had been real life then books then movies and in the MASH case then TeeVee. But before all that there was the Phil Silvers Show about a Sergeant Bilko and this followed from Mister Roberts. A happy con man who only committed harmless crimes and then only as response to an overly crude system which attempted to limit his life. This was in the day when TeeVee shows mattered. You absorbed them instead of merely carrying them to work to chatter about. It wasn't particularly clever in any way except in finding that crack between what we wanted in control and freedom. Its one large zone where Americans worked out how they think about forgivable even endearing lies in a military context a zone that has been appropriated by one of our political parties here. Because its big it sometimes pays off in laughs. Stripes was pretty darn funny I thought. It had the twist of the misfits actually defeating serious foes sort of folding in some Dirty Dozen. And sexual adventure. Now this well before the cultural wars escalated. It tries to touch that sweet spot like other remakes that manhandled Steve Martin. It is so unfunny you actually root for the Army to be the stronger player. Yet another way to track how societies work out the handles on military power.

 A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between the director Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as a secretary trying to save her boss from the electric chair by tracking down a mysterious phantom woman and Franchot Tone as a crazed and murderous sculptor. As well there are some fascinating smaller parts played by Elisha Cook Jr as a drugged out trap drummer as well as the other characters who make up parts of the conspiracy. If you're used to seeing Raines in more wholesome parts she's allowed to go overboard here especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone very different and though it isn't a convincing part he acts phenomenally. While the conspiracy is too contrived the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting. ,pos
 If derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing then you're in for a rare treat... They don't really appeal to me so I couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems like something straight out of the 1980s a different age when this would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentaries but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer. I don't think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? It's a big blot on both of your reputations. Listen carefully: can you hear the thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair? ,neg
 Oh brother. The only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total bomb from me is because it's at least historically noteworthy as the first Three Stooges film (when they weren't yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny Ted Healy). But even as a longtime Stooges fan I'd have to say that young Moe Larry and Curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to Mr. Healy's taller boss janitor. They're not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on-and-off-again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing. Most of this toothache deals with Jack Pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates Baron Munchausen (here's a good example of the level of humor: I object! On what grounds? Coffee grounds! ). His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante but even the schnoz himself is a bore. ,neg
 A 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy in comparison to her older sister. That is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic coming of age film from Director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is famous for previously directing Summer of '42 in 1971 and To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962 two giants of the coming of age genre. Here he directs newcomers in the principal roles: Reese Witherspoon in her film debut as the 14 year old girl; Emily Warfield as the older sister; Jason London as Court the 17 year old boy. Reese Witherspoon is astonishingly good in her film debut displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt never striking a false note. Warfield and London are both equally good as well. The film accurately depicts each adolescent's thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity never crossing over into maudlin excess even once. Kudos to the autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield; this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally dishonest or sensationalist. The music is wonderfully simple accentuating the tone and mood from scene to scene but never becoming intrusive. The beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director Freddie Francis who was in his 70's when this was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957 caring strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is good also as the boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out lessons to learn and truths to face in this sweet-natured film that packs an emotional wallop. To date this is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the very best films of 1991. **** of 4 stars. ,pos
 The original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters. I was quite surprised at how this played out. As a rule sequels are never as good as the original with a few exceptions. Though this one was not a great movie the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact. Jon Bon Jovi was a drawback initially but he proved to be a half-way decent Slayer. I doubt anyone could top James Wood's performance in the first one though... unless you bring in Buffy! All in all this was a decent watch & I would watch it again. I was left with two questions though... what happened to Jack Crow & how did Derek Bliss come to be a slayer? Guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination. ,pos
 Despite its flaws I enjoyed Cigarette Burns John Carpenter's Season One episode in the Masters of Horror series. Yes the story seemed like a cheap cross between IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS and 8MM but it was still quite good for the budget and time constraints given to it. With Pro-Life however the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else. There is solid directing as always from Carpenter yet there is a quality to the writing and whole production itself that gives the feeling it was made in a total and complete rush. The script isn't always clear the message fuzzy and the story is full of plot holes once you look back on them. Maybe had Carpenter re-written the script it could have been a worthwhile episode. Instead it's a mess that only hardcore Carpenter fans will find the slightest enjoyment in. Definitely the worst Carpenter has ever done. 2/10 ,neg
 Koen Wouters is a flemish singer and presenter. In the early ninety's he tried his hand on movies as well. But this unbelievable piece of junk ended his acting career once and for all. It also ended the acting career of dutch actress Nada van Nie who went on being a football-wife a TV presenter and program-maker. I actually did see this in an ( almost empty) theatre because I used to be a fan of the band of Koen Wouters Clouseau. I so regret spending money on it. It looks cheap it is a terrible story and it is executed bad in every possible way. Some people think it's so bad it's funny. I am not one of them. I just found it an incredible waste of time and money. ,neg
 save your money. i have been a fan of fullmoon productions for a long time and i have never seen them make a movie as bad as this. the casting is terrible the story is even worse and the special affects are worse than any movie iv'e seen sence the 80's. this movie is so bad i cant even suggest renting it. ,neg
 I got this film about a month ago and I am now a fanatic fan of Drew Barrymore's. I love a happy ending and this film gives a brilliant one with the truths of Red Sox slotted in! It's about a maths teacher who takes some promising kids on a maths trip to a company where the successful Lindsey(Drew) shows them some information. This then leads in the Ben(teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it isn't all simple when he confesses he is a massive Red Sox fan. First of all things are fine but then his baseball gets in the way of Lindseys life. It's all fine in the end and It took one shot to get Drew running across the field!! I got it for two quid in Blockbusters so I was happy. If you like films like this I suggest you see some more of Drew's work like Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even her new film with Hugh Grant in called Music and Lyrics. ,pos
 The film released at the start of 2000 alongwith MELA both disasters So sad to start a millennium with such nonsense The film seems to suit 70's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000 Anywayz some classic gems from the film: Paresh Rawal I don't understand to laugh at his role or cry Reason: He goes searching his mother in the village worst part is when he realises a secret of Anil he keeps the secret in his stomach which becomes big and makes him look pregnant I remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke Urrf!!!! as a child i laughed at it that time but here? The whole film is a joke can't explain We have Anil in a dual role(One older and younger) and Rekha playing the older's wife and Raveena the youngers We also have reject Harish while Shakti playing the son of Aruna Irani who both fight on who has the worst wig Direction is outdated Music is bad Anil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort Rekha is adequate Raveena too is okay Harish is bad Shakti Kapoor is terrible Aruna Irani is as usual Rajnikant is okay in a cameo ,neg
 I LOVED this flick when it came out in the 80's and still do! I still quote classic lines like say it again and you said you'd rip my balls off sir . Ron Leibman was hot and very funny! Although it was underrated and disowned by MAD I have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that I would take with me if sent to a deserted island! I only wish that someone would release the DVD because my VHS tape is about worn out! If you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic! It is military humor at it's best and worse! Rent it if you can't own it! ,pos
 Not a bad film. Somehow I was made to actually root for the Iranians to win the game played in the movie even though I don't know anything about soccer and am not a fan. The ending on the bus was exhilarating. The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and how they are not allowed to go into sporting arenas amongst men because their swearing is inappropriate for women to hear. Despite this law some women try to sneak in but many of them get caught and detained. It's really astonishing that any society could still have such antiquated notions of gender. In an interview Panahi says his films are documents of history and its injustices and that one day in the future we can watch these movies and see how Iran once lived. One hopes that future will come sooner rather than later. ,pos
 dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the best movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best. why the script writers for this movie aren't writing big budget films i will never understand. another is the cast. it is great. this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong. raptor island is a work of art. i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing EVER. ,pos
 No wonder this movie never saw the light of day. The timing was of the release was awful. The Gong Show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie came out so who would pay money just to see a few of the censored clips from the original run of the show? And the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic 90-minute whine by Chuck Barris about how hard his life was as host of the show. Did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed-up millionaire life? Did he really think we even wanted to KNOW about his life? (Obviously so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a CIA operative.) Did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes? Or the network executive hounding him at every turn? This might have worked as the plot for a 30-minute sitcom episode but not as a full-length movie. However it was nice to see Rip Taylor Gene Gene and the Unknown Comic again (although to make the movie spicy they included only his most vulgar routines). And as someone else has pointed out this is Phil Hartman's first significant movie part (even though it lasts only a minute). Note his name is spelled HARTMANN in the credits which is the name he was born with. You can't miss his voice and facial expressions even though he's much thinner and younger than in the SNL days. Ed Molinaro (Hill Street Blues) also has a tiny part; one of his first after leaving the soap world. ,neg
 Grand epic as it is Kenneth Branagh's monumental rendering of what is perhaps William Shakespeare's most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power. Two entirely separate sittings would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making. While I absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such I must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old bards flamboyance his rhetoric (and he sends himself up so well) and his many flourishes. Thus Hamlet loses its impact as it loses its grip. From Patrick Doyle's music to Alex Thomson's cinematography to Tim Harvey's exquisite sets the movie is a feast of visual and aural delights which compliments a fine cast. Branagh has taken on three huge mantels adapting directing and playing. His adaptation is superb his direction strong but by the time he got to the role of Hamlet the strain seemed to be showing; yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly taxing role. Derek Jacobi gobbles up the sinister Claudius with glee and Julie Christie is most dramatic as his queen Gertrude. Richard Briers is marvellous as Polonius and Charlton Heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player King. Many others drop by including Jack Lemmon (superb in a very small role) Billy Crystal Dame Judi Dench Sir John Mills Sir John Gielgud Sir Richard Attenborough and Gerard Depardieu. The acting prize though must go to one of the great thespian discoveries of recent years Kate Winslet. Hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair Ophelia. To finish (before this review goes on longer than the film) I must say it is the length that really tests the viewer in this movie. Branagh has directed with purpose giving many important impacting scenes. Too many of them outstay their welcome. Watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many pearls of wisdom we have garnered from it. Neither a lender nor a borrower be or Be true to thyself . And of course: To be or not to be . The opening two hours does take some perseverance but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which gathers momentum from the tragic funeral onward.

 By Hook or By Crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style and it's beautifully shot by Ann T. Rosetti and wonderfully written -- truly poetic. The lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model/inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere. This film has so much energy so much poignant passion and scruffy San Francisco heart to it. I can't recommend it highly enough! The best butch buddy movie of all time! ,pos
 Republic pictures comes late in the game to the werewolf er Werecat genre. The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts. He is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller. The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a catman . Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancÃ© ends up dead. Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn't know if he's the killer or not. Okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed. There are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections. The acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hatted killer he's the most interesting thing in this film. despite its short running time (just over an hour) I think the reason that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it. As good as the talk is I just wished someone would do something. When it finally did happen in the closing minutes it was too little too late.. Take a pass. ,neg
 Darius Goes West is a film depicting American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful fun filled and sometimes heartbreaking film shows a young man who never expected but longed to see what was outside the confines of his lovely city of Athens GA. Darius wished to see the ocean. His longtime friends Logan Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius' wish come true. They started small - Ben & Logan's mom started an email campaign to bring awareness to Darius' condition: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and to raise funds for the fellas to take Darius to not only see the ocean but to see these great United States. To say the young college buddies succeeded in bringing hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement. They realized Darius' dream and then some. They put their lives on hold while showing love care and tons of fun to Darius while helping Darius see how he can in turn show those same traits to others suffering from DMD. Darius went on to volunteer for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair collecting money (along with his buddies) outside a local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams do come true - all you need is hope and a group of college friends to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no one else deserves it more. Martha Sweeney. ,pos
 This movie got off to an interesting start. Down the road however the story gets convoluted with a poor illustration of ancient black magic rituals. The male lead was very good even though he gets the worst end of the stick in the climax. In comparison this is Boomerang meets Extremities . ,neg
 Really touching story of a recruitment camp in America where young men are prepared for the Vietnam war. The human study always appealed to me when it comes to war movies because it translates personal subjective opinions on war opposed war action movies where action and technical data are being analyzed to the prejudice of the human factor. The movie manages to put a new spin on an already ancient subject and manages to distance itself from usual war movies especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the view-point of traditional standard. The movie focuses on the tragic character of Bozz who smartly avoids being sucked in by the dehumanizing war machine and refuses to give up control over his destiny and fight for something he doesn't believe in spends his energy in searching ways to avoid being sent overseas both for himself and comrades and ironically ends up finding his own just reason for finally going to war. Perfect irony. The acting is truly exceptional and the documentary-style shooting almost makes you feel transposed into the movie. Also the movie will provide food for thought for those exhilarated by the action in usual war movies or war-games enthusiasts hopefully awakening some minds of a generation which luckily escaped the terror of being drafted. ,pos
 you must be seeing my comments over many films under Evren Buyruk ..I am off to make another comment over a movie that is not even worth a minute of talking though..This film is basically two hours of Dafoe's character drinking himself - nearly literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised. It was just a grim sad waste of time. Willem Dafoe is excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this film just sucked. Slow doesn't make the movie bad it was just bad. The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision but as entertainment it put me to sleep. (Seriously I fell asleep and had to re-watch the film - which was even more disappointing.) I generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others even when they suck but this film warranted one. It's just too bad that these great actors were shamed with this end result. ,neg
 A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read. -Mark Twain 'Classic' seems to be the word used to describe Scarface Brian DePalma's 1983 film about opulence self surrender greed and danger among Florida's drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films.' When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over but not all the praise it gets from audiences today and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public. First off the film is about a Cuban refugee with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma's directing genius and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money but all that has a price as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life when in true dramatic irony they are actually getting worse. 'Tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it's drug usage it's violence it's dialog totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters or brainless action fans. Next on the film is an adult drama. It is not a 'gangster film'. It has it's share of action but the action is plotted very carefully so it has a point. It's not like Aliens - an example of a big dumb action film and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. This being said the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style) which simply could give you chills or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy but it is a story and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer as Manny. I didn't think much of him in other films he did but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma's direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in Grease 2 she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony's sister Gina who when she smiles or cries we see her soul and her fresh way of living and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa a drug lord who runs deeper than a river and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina's torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. This reviewer learned one main thing when watching Scarface for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap ignore the mindless violence supporters and fix yourself a glass of Bailey's on the rocks and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film the real Scarface.  ,pos
 This Batman movie isn't quite as good as Batman mask of The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero But it is still a good installment to the Batman cartoons I say it is equally good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for all the same reasons The storyline is good not quite as good as the other one's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it The Cartoon effects are good The voice of actors are really good such as Kevin Conroy as Batman/ Bruce Wayne Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon Efrem Zimbalist Jr. Eli Marienthal as Robin. The villains are good such as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I am sure you will not be disappointed with batman Mystery of The Batwomen. So make sure that you rent or buy batman Mystery of The Batwoman the movie because it is really good. Overall score: ******* out of ********** *** out of ***** ,pos
 This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It has very good acting by Hanks Newman and everyone else. Definitely Jude Law's best performance. The cinematography is excellent the editing is about as good and includes a great original score that really fits in with the mood of the movie. The production design is also a factor in what makes this movie special. To me it takes a lot to beat Godfather but the fantastic cinematography displayed wins this contest. Definitely a Best Picture nominee in my book. ,pos
 This was a nice attempt at something but it is too pretentious and boring to rise above it's low budget trappings. The use of virtual sets almost works but at some points it fails miserably. They made good use of the small budget I guess. I just wish the story and most of the acting was better. There are a lot of parts where you see what they were aiming for and it would of been great if they actually hit those marks but they don't. Confusing and unbelievable story. Bad DVD transfer too. It doesn't take much for me to watch a movie in one sitting. This I had to shut off. It was too boring. I can do slow movies. But just make them appealing in some aspect. Visually story-wise acting etc. This was lacking in all departments so it never added up to an engrossing experience. Maybe the film maker's next attempt will be better. ,neg
 A mess of genres but it's mainly based on Stephen Chow's genre mash-ups for it's inspiration. There's magic kung-fu college romance sports gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping. The production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it's easy to get past the many flaws in this film. A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery that's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but can't read. The old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks. The new master gets mad at the now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master's weak punches and throws him out for the night. The boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster's club to play darts. This leads to a big fight the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation. Al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes. Aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie. The man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over. The plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end. The effects photography and stunt work are all top- notch and make up for the uninspired plot. Stephen Chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that's not a good reason to ignore it. It's quite entertaining even with a scatter-shot ending. Recommended. ,pos
 Lily Mars a smalltown girl living in Indiana dreams of making it big on Broadway and her aspirations are given a lift when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to notice her but he just gets annoyed with her antics. When Thornway goes back to New York to stage his show Lily follows (unknown to John of course) and Thornway eventually gives her a small role in his next show only as a favor to her family however Thornway starts to fall for this young girl and a romance blossoms which makes the show's leading lady Isabel Rekay jealous. When Isabel gets fed up with the John-Lily romance causing friction with the show she leaves and John decides to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later and Thornway is forced to tell Lily that she is back to her small bit role in the play which also may jeopardize the romance. Very charming film and a refreshing change to see Garland put the comedic touches into her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth while supposed to be humorous never threatened her singing career) I enjoyed Heflin's character (Thornway) more when he was annoyed with Lily rather than be the romantic. The film got to be somewhat predictable and the scenes weren't assembled that well together but a very enjoyable film. Rating 7. ,pos
 Don't think of this movies as just another kids movie - the whole family can enjoy it. Its a strange mix of a movie as its seems to have a movie within it but at least it does make sense at the end (unlike modern films!) It does give you all the elements of a film (decent plot good characters - well it does star the Muppets a list of lesser celebs* which films would clamour for) What is surprising is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions some sad some heartwarming some funny and some serious - it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together. * The celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine Miss Piggy!!!! ,pos
 You wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good and it isn't. It's a no budget ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand-held camera...and it's hilarious. The actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious readings. There is no plot to be seen. The little plot I could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be terrorizing a couple families. The gore effects are actually some of the most sickening I've ever seen. It seems the gore effects people raided a butcher shop for all the body parts and many scenes involve zombies dismembering people and eating their organs. It's a funny and sickening film and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie. My rating: BOMB/****. 90 mins. ,neg
 Imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch As soon as I first heard that my attention was locked on the Trailer And after the First Episode I found my self in love with this show. A Modern day Fairy Tale that Brings my Spirits up and Holds my attention throughout the entire show. I think the Acting and Casting is just perfect Each Character brings Something Unique to the show that adds to it's perfection. Even the one time Villains manage to overflow with A Unique sense From the Bee Man to the Guy who can Swallow Kittens they never seem to let me down. And the Deaths that would Normally lead to a Depressing Moment often end up being Purely Comical (Such as an Exploding Scratch & Sniff book) Even with the large amount of Crime shows we have now a days Daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest Being not just a Mystery but a love story Comedy and a Fairy Tale with a hint of Drama all baked into one Wonderful pie.....err show. What really shocked me was the fact that it was on ABC For Years I never had a reason to turn to ABC But this brought me back each week with a Smile on my face. It was as if Pushing Daisies Brought ABC back to life for me. But just like that after two seasons A few Awards A Large Fan Base and Positive Responses from Critics the show has been dropped. It seems as though Ned has Touched ABC again and forever killed it for me. I will always be a fan of this show though And I Recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they watch. ,pos
 Paperhouse is the most moving and poignant film I've ever seen. Often classed as a horror movie this I believe is a grave error. Some journo once called it the thinking person's Nightmare on Elm Street and while I accept the logic of his conclusion I can't help but think it's a tag that is ill deserved and misleading. Those that can only see horror are truly missing out here and only serves to demonstrate they're really not thinking at all. In fact just attempting to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea. Quite simply Paperhouse is perfect in every exquisite detail and will always have a special place in my heart. As someone wiser than me once said the film hits you on a completely emotional level which may go some way to explaining why my comments are so unrelentingly gushing. To be honest I make no apology for this so if you feel my words are too saccharine for your taste stop reading now because there's more to come. It's so rare to find a film that has at its heart the pain and heartache of childhood and the struggle to overcome the dreadful feelings of isolation and loneliness that can completely overwhelm us at this fragile time in our lives. Even more unusual to find child actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence required to make it all work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of Paperhouse owes much to their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood (often overlooked) in a seamless and convincing way. And yet both of these brilliant young stars seemed to have slipped through the grasp of the studios and have somehow faded away. Add to all this an incredibly talented director (Bernard Rose) imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you're ever likely to hear and you may start to get an inkling of why I have such affection and affinity for this film that no amount of words can express. ,pos
 Presenting Lily Mars is one of a genre of film that sadly seems to have disappeared with the studio system. Ok now that you know my bias here are some reasons I think this movie does stand out. 1. Although the basic plot - Lily Mars (Judy Garland) goes to New York becomes a star and wins the heart of her director (Van Heflin) is a pretty stock Hollywood story of the period the writers do vary the theme her a bit more than usual. Although Lily gets her big break when the star quits she isn't successful and has to swallow her pride and go back to playing a minor role in the show. 2. Judy Garland (enough said!) 3. The supporting cast includes some really great performances. Spring Byington as Lily's mother is truely wonderful as is Fay Bainter (the mother of the director - John Thornway (Van Heflin)). The standout supporting performance though goes to character actress Connie Gilchrist as Frankie a one time actress turned theater custodian. Worth a watch for sure. One of those movies that are designed to make you feel better about the world and your dreams. ,pos
 Citizen X tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed The Rostov Ripper This great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend a killer. The film shows how politics may haver helped the killer to continue his rampage for over 12 years. (Possibly over 50 victims mostly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rea as the lead detective and Donald Sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb. Jeffrey DeMunn as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of film which will mesmerize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the real case. This a film not to be missed. It debuted I believe on HBO and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding. Great film ,pos
 This movie deserves credit for its original approach. It combines elements of theater film and epic storytelling. Unfortunately it falls flat on all levels. The films biggest weakness is it's unwillingness to commit to anything; it has camp moralistic and epic elements without ever committing to any of them. As for the story itself Chretien de Troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable unbearably innocent Percival into a most ungallant and rude churl. Most likely two types of people will see this francophiles or Arthuriophiles. Speaking as one of the latter I found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story. ,neg
 Gods I haven't watched a movie this awful in a long while. Maybe not since 'The New Guy' or various Freddie Prinze Jr. movies. Yes it is that astoundingly awful. Mira Sorvino's blank and wooden acting surely must've been inspired by Freddie. The movie staging was awkward (like a play rather and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well on film). The actors had no idea what they were doing especially Sorvino. Her accent was awful and her sex appeal non-existent here so it was painful to see her 'seducing' other characters and they 'falling' for it. And what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs? Nonsensical! I had to turn the dvd player off it would have been self-inflicted pain to finish this film. ,neg
 The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton Julia Stiles Jerry O'Connell Jeremy Sisto Jordana Brewster Leonard Roberts Bill Smitrovich Annie Corley Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull incoherent and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10. Not rated (later rated PG-13 for video/DVD release). ,neg
 I still can't believe that Wes Craven was responsible for this piece of crap.This movie is worse than Deadly Friend .The plot is stupid the acting is mediocre and the film is deadly dull.I don't know why Wes Craven hates his debut Last House on the Left -an absolute masterpiece of the genre and likes(probably)this turkey.Don't get me wrong I really like some of his movies but it was a real torture sitting and watching this. ,neg
 Let's Bowl started out on local television in the Twin Cities. It came on late at night something you'd stumble across while channel surfing after your 7th bottle of Hamm's. Even the ads were locally produced featuring Wally outside Grumpy's Bar holding a microphone and stammering nervously -- Ahh...over to you Steve Sedahl. Not sure why but that one always made me laugh. There was a bowling contest featured under the guise of settling a dispute between two bowlers but the game was secondary to the commentary and clips. Sedahl played it straight counter-balanced by Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious Wally Hotvedt. Highlights included segments like How to Properly Dispose of an Old Bowling Ball (chuck them into a lake) and Tips on Dating where the duo date a couple of hookers and Wally ends with the bitter complaint I could have done that myself! Another segment -- what the duo did on their days off -- featured Steve in beer can strewn hovel pigging out from the fridge while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor's Falls dressed in his tight pale blue blazer and over-sized headphones. Hilarious! Wally's awestruck comments about league bowlers and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various splits were also highlights. Let's Bowl was picked up by Comedy Central and had some good moments but the network never really knew what to do with it running it during prime time and emphasizing the bowling competition which was never the point of the show. The constant commercials interrupted the flow and the side characters (Ernie the Pig Butch etc.) were more distractions than anything else. The whole thing seemed rushed and kind of forced. Even Jon Stewart dissed Let's Bowl on the Daily Show -- (not enough lame snide jokes?) -- an ignominious treatment for a show that deserved far better. How often does a Let's Bowl come along in the world of modern television a locally flavored mix of comedic genius and total crap? The networks have the total crap part down cold but it's a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark strange funny little gem like Let's Bowl. Here's hoping they'll put it out on DVD. ,pos
 What the movie The 60s really represents (to those of us who growled around in the belly of America in those times) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated stereotyped characters the genuineness of the issues remains clear. Not only were those radical times of change but also very confusing times. Two basic things changed our world then: the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the overwhelming influence of the media. Those two new freedoms began social changes that soon became institutionalized. From chaos came sensitivity from disorder came values. Bear in mind however that the bulk of Americans were not involved in this... they worked they played they watched the news... and slowly they became effected by the efforts and struggles of the minorities... the Civil Rights workers the Political Activists the Anti-War efforts the War on Poverty.... The representation of the power of the press and TV in particular was well reflected although the conflict between the general public's attitude and those seeking to change things was at best ignored... and at worst misrepresented.. Middle class Americans weren't all standing around angrily holding baseball bats or disowning their wayward daughters. They were confused too. Let us not forget how Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers and how The Beatles began an onslaught that killed the Folk-Protest Movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie or even any mention of them. I think if you didn't live the decade you might not have a sense of what the movie is about the overall picture is a bit dim. At one point I held down a steady job while my sister lived at the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. At another point I was in Haight Asbury and in the Detroit Riots while she worked and played the housewife in Maine and Connecticut. Roles were constantly changing. The movie depicts three siblings of a middle class family. They represent the hippie child the political activist and the active military personnel. Dad represents the typical attitudes and mom represents the voice of reason tolerance and sometimes compromise... for the sake of peace. The Black family comprises a minister and his son... disproportionately I think. I assume the producers knew all the variables and had to settle on limitations or else the film would have become a long boring documentary. Dad's message was that anger produces bitterness and bitterness produces chaos. It was clearly a message directed to today's youth. We are looking at a unique solution to social problems and also how issues divide us... The 60s were unusual in that way and only the Roaring 20s compare. In other words this movie has a moral after all. In the end it is our Collective Individualism that survives. Put that in your oxymoron list. Everyone was a God a Guru or a free-spirited genius in the 60s. It was a time of magic and madness. No one will ever nail the 60s down right... it was too diverse (this movie is close). At least we can say we are not ashamed of it that we learned and grew from it and that for once a generation shaped and changed America... for the better. ,pos
 ***SPOILERS*** Let's start with the good of this film--the serviceable acting of Cynthia Rothrock and Richard Norton. The rest of the acting is awful (this isn't aided by the atrocious script). The worst culprit is the villain Buntao the head of an Asian crime syndicate (played by Frans Tumbuan). I was laughing my head off as he was expressing his fury over having lost a bunch of money; horrid performance. Patrick Muldoon isn't much better and his it's a hostile takeover line (that's the remainder of the title of this film) was delivered about as badly as one could do it. There are no other main characters but no other actor/actress distinguished him/herself in this film. We next come to the plot. This should tell you all you need to know: In the original Rage and Honor Cynthia Rothrock who plays Chris Fairchild was a teacher in the inner city. Now she's a C.I.A. agent (or was it some other governmental agency--sorry but this film was so bad that I don't even remember). Hmmm...I can imagine what that C.I.A. application process was like. Interviewer: What past job experience do you have? Chris: I was a teacher. Interviewer: Okay; you're hired! I only give it a 2 because of some decent acting and a nice plot twist at the end (though we know that Tommy (Muldoon) the secret villain will be caught). ,neg
 IQ is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that pits the greatest and deepest-thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as Cupid's helpers. The juxtaposition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light-hearted yet thoughtful movie. You don't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to nurture budding love but at other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space/time of our age. The end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein Meg Ryan creates a quirky scatter-brained mathematician and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science. All together they create a farcical trip through love and science mind and heart. ,pos
 That was the first thing that sprang to mind as I watched the closing credits to Europa make there was across the screen never in my entire life have I seen a film of such technical genius the visuals of Europa are so impressive that any film I watch in it's wake will only pale in comparison forget your Michael Bay Ridley Scott slick Hollywood cinematography Europa has more ethereal beauty than anything those two could conjure up in a million years. Now I'd be the first to hail Lars von Trier a genius just off the back of his films Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark but this is stupid the fact that Europa has gone un-noticed by film experts for so long is a crime against cinema whilst overrated rubbish like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Life is Beautiful clean up at the academy awards (but what do the know) Europa has been hidden away absent form video stores and (until recently) any British TV channels. The visuals in Europa are not MTV gloss; it's not a case of style over substance its more a case of substance dictating style. Much like his first film The Element of Crime von Trier uses the perspective of the main character to draw us into his world and much like Element the film begins with the main character (or in the case of Europa we the audience) being hypnotized. As we move down the tracks the voice of the Narrator (Max von Sydow) counts us down into a deep sleep until we awake in Europa. This allows von Trier and his three cinematographers to pay with the conventions of time and imagery there are many scenes in Europa when a character in the background who is in black and white will interact with a person in the foreground who will be colour von Trier is trying to show us how much precedence the coloured item or person has over the plot for instance it's no surprise that the first shot of Leopold Kessler (Jean-marc Barr) is in colour since he is the only character who's actions have superiority over the film. The performances are good they may not be on par with performances in later von Trier films but that's just because the images are sometimes so distracting that you don't really pick up on them the first time round. But I would like to point out the fantastic performance of Jean-Marc Barr in the lead role whose blind idealism is slowly warn down by the two opposing sides until he erupts in the films final act. Again muck like The Element of Crime the film ends with our hero unable to wake up from his nightmare state left in this terrible place with only the continuing narration of von Sydow to seal his fate. Europa is a tremendous film and I cant help thinking what a shame that von Trier has abandoned this way of filming since he was clearly one of the most talented visual directors working at that time Europa much like the rest of his cinematic cannon is filled with a wealth of iconic scenes. His dedication to composition and mise-en-scene is unrivalled not to mention his use of sound and production design. But since his no-frills melodramas turned out to be Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark then who can argue but it does seems like a waste of an imaginative talent. 10/10 ,pos
 I noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and I too didn't have high hopes for it. I figured it was another You Got Served type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting. I was at the theater and deciding between this and Meet the Spartans and picked this. To my surprise the acting wasn't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good. The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of listening to the garbage posted on here I recommend going to see a matinÃ©e showing of this movie so you don't spend too much. I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it. When it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones. Go see the movie and judge for yourself. Hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on DVD and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released. edit The movie is now moving closer to its correct rating. Over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1. ,pos
 Sequel to The Kingdom is bloodier and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and couldn't sit through all 5 1/2 hours) but I loved what I saw. Ghosts blood murder poisoning mutated babies voodoo...this has it all! If you have a strong stomach and like weird movies this is for you. Also you don't have to see Part 1 to understand this...you'll figure it out! Does anyone know if Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon movies in a theatre is tiring. Sadly there probably won't be a Kingdom 3 --Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after this was filmed. But you never know! ,pos

 Here's a review for people like me. This movie sucks from beginning to end. I threw popcorn at the screen and resorted to entertaining myself a la MSF2000. The plot hinges on chance happenings and relies on stupidity from people who are supposed to be smart. The lead falls for a con man and it doesn't occur to her that she might get conned????? And she's rich???? And she's a famous psychologist????? COME ON people. She enters the bar at just the most convenient moment when everyone is assembled to talk about conning her??? That was so staged that it felt like slap in the face to even half-witted movie viewers. Rain man would have been insulted. I also admit that I despise Mamet dialogue with the kind of passion that some people have for meat-eaters war-starters and fur-wearers. My hatred is so complete that it defies logic. But I'll give it a shot. That it's not supposed to sound real is fine. I don't care. It's that everyone talks the SAME. Mamet can't create characters; all he can do is foist his voice on us relentlessly through different actors. No wonder his actors are so wooden. They're confused about everyone being the same character. (However his later films do improve.) ,neg
 Half Past Dead starring Steven Seagal in the main role was a major B-hit. Half Past Dead 2 is just a direct-to-video sequel an action movie with nothing lose but with no capacity to win something. It's less entertaining than the first one: in all aspects. But it's although worthy a look. If you like action movies or just something to watch during a popcorn session; if you also like to watch former WWE stars on screen or even if you love to watch sequels even if they are direct or not. Kurupt did a good job Bill Goldberg was below the average I think he isn't made to the job. Kurupt is a good comedian I say. The rest did the job but nothing amazing nothing far from alright. Technical details well a production made by Sony can't be great. Cinematography was a disaster but overall direction was acceptable. Whatever just watch it if you want. If you watch you won't lose anything. But if you don't... well you won't lose either. ,neg
 Ok the film wasn't going to win any awards and it is pure bubblegum and it is a modern update on It's a wonderful life . But it's just come out as a cheap release on DVD and there are a lot worse ways of blowing $13. You get a film that has a surprisingly strong cast but for most they were still a year or two from becoming B list celebs. However it's an enjoyable way of passing an hour and half just don't think too much in it. ,pos
 This has to be one of the best movies to come out of HK in a long time i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title. Loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with Sam Lee's impossibly believable insane behavior and Edison's portrayal of a killer machine which totally reversed his normal idol image. i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie. However i must warn you this is also an equally depressing movie as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own and struggling to breathe. Makes you think about what is life about really. ,pos
 What a delightful romp Â– a very competently made film that has so much charm and a feelgood factor that a lot of romantic comedies lack. Einstein is brilliantly acted by Walter Matthau while Meg Ryan's Catherine is unforgettable Â– better than I have seen her in those films opposite Tom Hanks Â– as the young mathematician struggling to be recognized. You don't need to be a young woman to understand Catherine's struggle and feel sympathetic for her immediately and as a young man it's easy to understand what must have gone through Ed's (Tim Robbins) mind in pursuing his true love. There's universal appeal in these emotions even if I.Q. keeps it all light fun and tied up nicely. Sure it's not heavy but if you look there are some subtexts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritualist; his sayings such as something along the lines of 'If it is not impossible then why do it?' suggest he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals beyond one's immediate grasp. In this film there are questions of what an accident really is Â– such as whether Albert and his whacky sidekicks' intervention in prying Catherine away from stiff-upper-lip loveless James (Stephen Fry Â– who gives this otherwise cardboard character life and you cannot help but feel for his lack of feeling) counts. How much intervention happens in our lives that we do not see and comes across as serendipitous? And of course we'd like to think in real life despite what we often observe of the people we know that we Edwards get the Catherines and Jameses have to learn how to defrost the icewater in their veins. How nice to know that it might work out in I.Q.'s innocent (and disturbingly exclusively Caucasian) Eisenhower-era land of make-believe. ,pos
 George and Kim are traveling with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in upstate New York when their car hits a deer and swerves into a ditch.But what seems to be a mere occurrence of misfortune marks the beginning of a terrifying journey where myth becomes reality and a flesh-eating spirit half animal and half man Wendigo haunts a small town... Wendigo by Larry Fessenden is a thought-provoking horror film that often tenderfoot's into a somber family drama.The acting is great the characters are well-developed and there are some bone-chilling moments.The subtle glimpses of Wendigo are handled effectively and it's never clear what is real and what is imagined or even if the story is taking place entirely in Miles' head.Overall Wendigo is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and surely won't be the last.Give this film a chance if you don't mind watching something unconventional.8 out of 10. ,pos
 Another fun witty frothy RKO musical with Astaire and Rogers FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming film. While it lacks the stand-out great tunes of SWNG TIME (although the final number Face the music and dance is one of the team's best and rightfully so) it is hugely enjoyable as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930's. Once again the plot is lightweight and forgettable but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is sheer heaven. These two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene. While there are better Fred and Ginger musicals this is certainly a must-see. ,pos
 THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - Netherlands 1983). A film based on a novella by Gerard Reve that works best as a thriller. That's quite surprising considering Reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work. The Fourth Man is top-heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and I'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. In The Fourth Man he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but as in most of his films he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face it undermines an otherwise good story. Nevertheless when you can cope with Verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach it's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round Thom Hoffman and Jeroen KrabbÃ© in particular. Camera Obscura --- 7/10 ,pos
 This is going to be the most useless comment I have ever put down but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that Freddy's Dead is. It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring pointless and nearly death free. The horrible 3-D ending and over-the-top CORNY kills are enough to drive this film into the ground. However it doesn't stop there just add bad acting a terrible script and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano! It's no wonder why Freddy as always played by Robert Englund has made two postmortem appearances. I would too if I went out like that. This is a strictly fans only movie don't stare at our shame. ,neg
 Hey Arnold! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie. The plot is not very creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It is boring. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids. Hey Arnold the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie is about five times more sedated and a good way to put anyone including kiddies to sleep. Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie this is it. I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel. ,neg
 The acting other reviews notwithstanding was remarkably well-done. Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying obnoxious Austrian climber quite well. Other acting is fine. The story could have been riveting but somehow it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown and so the story which could have been quite dramatic fails to draw in this audience. Beautiful scenery and cinematography a remarkably dramatic true story important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not try as I might involve myself in this story. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation) I expected to *love* this flick - and yet it left me cold. It could be a failing within myself but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction scriptwriting production editing - somehow they lost me. It's a shame because it could have been wonderful. Good acting dramatic story beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn't. Probably worth watching just to make your own mind up on it - but don't expect too much and perhaps you won't be as disappointed as I was. Mostly it bored me. ,neg
 For me too this Christmas special is one that I remember very fondly. In 1989 I snatched up the 2 CDs I found of the soundtrack recording giving one to my sister and keeping the other for myself. It's part of my family's Christmas tradition now and I would love to be able to actually see the show again rather than just remember it as I listen. It has been noted elsewhere that John Denver made a number of appearances on the Muppet Show and they did more than one special together. The good rapport between Denver and his fuzzy companions comes through clearly here in a charming and fun show that is good for all ages. ,pos
 Despite of the success in comedy or drama the Turkish directors are failure in horror-thriller. Okul-D@bbe are good examples for the awful horror Turkish films. But if you watch Gen you will understand that it is a strike. The atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark. Also the special features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtracks fit the movie but the script is not totally perfect and the theme of the movie is ordinary. As a result Gen does not add any difference to horror movies but it does not disappoint thriller fans. In this respect it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10) ,pos
 SPOILERS HEREIN My High School did all they could to try and motivate us for exams. But the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker who was none other than Australian Kickboxing's favorite son Stan The Man Longinidis. The first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. Now his speech was full of the usual if you fail to prepare then prepare to fail stuff but there were various instances where I got really worked up. The guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no-one else. He was offered many deals in the past to give up kick-boxing but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming Australia's greatest kick-boxer. He said that he wasn't a sell-out he was happy and a retiree he wasn't ever involved in any other activity other than KickboxingÂ… then he plugged his film. Yes you heard right he PLUGGED his new FILM. As he talked about it he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called Trojan Warrior . (This all being before he was defeated by Gurkan Ozkan in his final career fight (for now)) Stan plays Ajax a kick-boxing ex-special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of Melbourne. Ajax's cousin Theo (Arthur Angel) recently sold out (well at least Stan didn't stray too far away from EVERYTHING) to the feds and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime. Ajax and Theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations from fighting in a Kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party. It's all pretty ridiculous but if Silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here this man should never be handed a camera again. I'll admit I was actually pumped to see this. I love action films even if they're corny and especially if it's set in my own backyard. But what I was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word go and continued to do so after the words for the love of God please make it stop! subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open characters were just thrown in for absolutely NO reason whatsoever and the most over-choreographed fight scenes that didn't even remotely reflect Stan's actual talent in Kickboxing. The cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone REMOTELY famous (Dermot Brereton Mark Chopper Read and Greg Matthews). The whole time you're sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background. Too bad the movie relies heavily on split-second appearances by former celebrities. Remember those plot-holes I told you about? Ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up wrongly accused for murdering his wife. Now we hear that Ajax was in special forces via ONE single sentence in the WHOLE film and then leave it for buggery. This is followed by another SINGLE sentence which persuades Ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up. Then get this at the end it is revealed to Ajax that his wife isn't actually dead but was sold into prostitution. Do we see her? No. Does Ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this? No. Now THAT's a marriage! Amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap some website described this film as Â…a cross between Jackie Chan & Guy RitchieÂ… . Has this man ever sat down and watched a Jackie Chan film?! Chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than Stan did doingÂ… well ANYTHING! And Guy Ritchie is the crime-film Messiah and you're comparing him to Salik Silverstein!? This film is more like a mix between Pizza and Enter The Ninja . Now where do you thing the whole Trojan Warrior title comes from? Ajax's fierce fighting skills like that of an Ancient Greek Warrior? No. The gangsters' unification to find Theo like that of the Trojan Empire? No. It's becauseÂ… wait for itÂ… Theo carries a condom around with him. Yes that right because THEO is ALWAYS PREPARED with a Trojan BRAND RUBBER in his pocket he is a Trojan WARRIOR! I had the displeasure of seeing Trojan Warrior on DVD as well as it's special features: Â• Video clip of Chop Chop a rap song by Mark Chopper Read: Chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that ANYONE can rap. The funny thing was Chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from Doncaster using such words as dis and dope etc in their Australian accents. Face it people rap was developed in the States LEAVE IT THERE! The clip looked like something a Channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together. Â• Bloopers: There was no real difference between these and the actual film. Â• Stan The Man Longinidis Kickboxing Featurette: This wasn't too bad considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles (I think I saw Dennis Alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage). I don't want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film but... oh wait I just did. My advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of Trojan Warrior tape them together and use it for a paperweight because this movie is just that damn bad. ,neg
 A favourite of mine this movie tells of two feuding New York characters Steve Brodie(Raft) and Chuck Connors(Beery) who both strive to be the Main Guy in the Bowery in the late Nineteenth Century. Brodie(1863-1901) and Connors(1852-1913) were real people though this is a heavily fictionalized account of their antics(based on a play).Brodie's legendary(did he do it?- it's still a cause of argument!) jump from the Brooklyn bridge(1886) for which he became famous is shown here as happening around the same time as the Spanish-American war(1898).Director Walsh clearly had a great affection for the period so beautifully recreated here and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer Trixie Odbray(a young Pert Kelton).Raft is at his slickest as Brodie and Beery shows again what a clever actor he was as tough big hearted and at times quite touching Connors.Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing. Full of life and energy The Bowery moves at a fast pace(unlike many early talkies ).It is not an easy movie to find but is well worth looking out for. ,pos
 I am a huge John Denver fan. I have a large collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas special when it was originally on TV and loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I have the original CD and later release. The later release is missing several songs though. I see that it has been released this year with all original songs. To my surprise I found the original CD for sale at $75.00. WOW - to think that a Christmas Cd would be worth that much. To me no amount is worth selling this treasure. It is my favorite Christmas CD. I have never been able to find it on VHS or DVD. I would love to have either version. If anyone has one available please let me know. Thanks ,pos
 This film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness. While a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony it certainly can't promote winning bridge so the satire didn't work for me. But there were some items I found enjoyable anyway especially with the big bridge match between Paul Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk near the end of the film. It is treated like very much like a championship boxing match. Not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring there is a referee hovering between the contestants and radio broadcaster Roscoe Karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings. At one point he even enumerates One... Two... Three... Four... as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event. And people were glued to their radios for it all a common event for championship boxing matches. That spoof worked very well indeed. Unfortunately few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire. Paul Lukas doesn't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely Loretta Young and the usual comic Frank McHugh weren't given good enough lines; Glenda Farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film but she practically disappears thereafter. What a waste of talent! ,neg
 An absolute steaming pile of cow dung. It's mind-blowing to me that this film was even made. Hip-Hop and old westerns just don't seem to mix. What target audience were these people thinking of when planning this trainwreck. Not only is the concept and plot a joke but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare of a film makes their entire careers a laughing stock. The chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of dialogue she should have been asking which one of her friends was playing this sick joke. After some research I actually found a list of some other actors who passed on this film: Jada Pinkett-Smith Denzel Washington Brandy Monique Kim Kardasian Jenna Jameson Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. Simply put I would rather stare at a blank TV than watch this movie again. ,neg
 One of if not the worst film to come out of Britain in the 80s. This tawdry tale of a middle aged lecher who 'seduces' two teenage scrubbers who babysit for him and his faux-posh wife has nothing to redeem it. In turns gratuitous puerile uncouth and unrealistic this film plumbs the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny provocative intellectual and controversial. Perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of George Costigan Michelle Holmes and Siobhan Finneran are completely stitched by such a lame script. It's no surprise that this was the late Andrea Dunbar's only work to make it onto the screen. Complete and utter rubbish on every level. ,neg
 I love cartoons. They can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons') good taste ('South Park') spectacle ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age' such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time it's a really fun film. Sit back enjoy the deliberate anachronisms the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs. The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth Sid an idiotic sloth and Diego a sabretooth tiger as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way naturally they have a whole lot of problems. Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat history's unluckiest rodent who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers on top of dead trees in ice-caves. His opening scene is a classic. It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in but some of the scenes such as the nappy-changing or the dodos are hilarious the animals are likeable and it looks good. There is one quite touching moment too when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes. Not a must-see but good for a fun hour or so. 7/10 ,pos
 I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable. Judge for yourself. Be warned the following will not only give away the plot but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie. A computer virus designed by a frustrated nerd sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body. What it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium. Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck develops tunnel vision his skin will turn white of the calcium after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk. This virus is very intelligent. When it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head. The virus also senses aggression against remote controls and the keyboard of an ATM. Fortunately it could be stopped by throwing over outdated desktop pc's in a rack and electrocuting the nerd with his back on a broken computer and his feet in some spilled water. Oh dear... ,neg
 Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie obviously never consulted any books about Lucille Ball especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many mistakes in a biopic ranging from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors but it would go on for pages. In all I believe that Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I were Lucie Arnaz and Desi Jr. I would be irate at how many mistakes were made in this film. The filmmakers tried hard but the movie seems awfully sloppy to me. ,neg
 I like the good and evil battle. I liked Eddie in this movie better than any movie he has ever done. He wasn't The smart cocky know it all he usually plays. He shows heart and a more humble humor. The fact that it shows there are stranger things in Heaven and on earth than we can think of gives me hope. ,pos
 Brown of Harvard is a hard movie to pin down. We expect a lot more from our movies these days so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. William Haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and even glory. All of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted EXCEPT for the homoerotic tie between Billy and Jack Pickford the town nerd. The movie has everything romance tears love death and even sports... It's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century. ,pos
 When I was over at Hollywood video I looked through their clearance out movies and there was DEMONICUS for five buckaroos plus fifty percent off! I saw it only once before and couldn't pass up this great deal! The second viewing was much better than the first. The box is so cool and the music is very good. If you haven't seen Demonicus yet I recommend that you do or if you rented and hated Demonicus do give it another chance as another viewing of it may change your mind. If you seen a copy at Hollywood Video for the price I got it for don't pass it up as it is a great deal! Demonicus is well a very different but entertaining movie.Believe it or not is like watching a interactive video game with out playing it!It has very low budget and actors I'M sure that nobody is familiar with. We began the the video game uh I mean film with a guy and a woman some where in Italy and there is a cave that actually looks like a rail road/train track tunnel and she says don't go in there and what does he do?The normal stuff!HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO HER! He goes in there and find lots of gladiator artifacts and armor and a almost perfectly preserved body of a legendary gladiator named Tyrannous!Where did the chair come from that Tyrannous was sitting on and how did his body stay so good and where did the Cauldron Pot come from?So every cave is complete with a Caultron Pot?Tyrannous is wearing his armor helmet and has a weapon or two.He does the dumbest thing a person could do he puts on the helmet and is taken over by the spirit of Tyrannous! From there he walks around just killing all of the campers near by to bring back the real Tyrannous. Now I said before its like a video game.Its hard to explain but it just feels like it.The music even sounds like video games.The acting is really terrible.The actors say things like why is he doing this oh he was nuts already and Fine since he's nuts i'm going home!Also the movie also has some major errors like a guy is running and trying to find his girlfriend in the night and is still running in the day time still searching for her with out taking a break! This movie has some errors but it isn't a classic like Werewolf but it is entertaining if you like really low budget error prone movies then you better see Demonicus! ,pos
 This movie is a riot. I cannot remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies. I've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny. But this one is wall to wall great lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in. The movie was non-stop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up. Other than that it's a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations. I'd like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the Zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes the first time around. You have to see it two or three times to get it all in. As far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit it's choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that. All the characters are great. It's not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable. No victims in this movie. Also thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film. You just wish that women like her really existed. She's not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbite. If you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it. I assure you the trailer does not do it justice. They do not give away all the good jokes. Just some of the mediocre ones. Oh and one more thing. I hope critics put this on their top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies don't get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don't put it on their list. This means you Ebert!!! ,pos
 Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power- he tries to get her to read Nietzche- she says books ain't never done her no good.Soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others.Finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city.We follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank.The dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production code.Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims.Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection - I watched the extended version- the DVD has both versions plus Red-Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge.An interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir.

 Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in A Room With a View passionate Irish thief in In the Name of the Father an impudent violent butcher in Gangs of New York (in a performance ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's in the Pianist) and as the outrageous Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in My Left Foot (just to name a few). His roles all influence eachother but each is seperate and utterly unique. He changes completely with each character he takes on. And I'm beginning to believe that he can act as anything. Anything. As Cristy Brown he is stunning. He does not ridicule the character and he does not pity the character. A difficult achievement. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. An outrageous man. Human. This movie despite small scene-transition faults and the like is an inspiration. Yes it's predictable. But is it stupidly sentimental? No. I laughed. I cried. Not a single moment of cheese. Proof that this isn't a Hollywood movie. My favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant when Cristy is discussing painters with Eileen Peter and her friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax. I'll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that's animated. Wheel out the cripple! And his performance never slows down never falters and is beautiful. Simply. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again again and I never get tired of Cristy's perspicacious eyes twitching and guttural speeches. A must-see. Fo sho yo! ,pos
 A Murder investigation goes on back stage while The Vanities on its opening night plays on to an unknowing audience. Odd combination of musical and murder mystery is worth a look for its cast its production numbers and the sheer novelty of the film. Gertrude Michael has the showy role of a bitchy actress intent on stopping the marriage between the show's stars Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson as well as starring in the infamous Sweet Marijuana number (which was also on a 70s Bette Midler album). So while the chorus girls shuffle around backstage bumbling detective Victor McLaglen ogles the girls while he tries to solve the backstage murder of an unknown woman. We quickly learn that the maid (Dorothy Stickney) loves Brisson from afar that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) butts into everything. Lots of plots twists among the musical numbers. The show's best-known song is Cocktails for Two. Kitty Carlisle also sings the haunting Where Do They Come From? And there's a weird rhapsody that erupts into a Harlem specialty number featuring Duke Ellington! Quite the cast. Some terrific acting here especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is quite good as well. Brisson is a total zero though. Charles Middleton plays Homer Toby Wing plays Nancy Donald Meek plays the doctor and also see if you can spot Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball among the show girls. ,pos
 I love this freekin movie! Walsh is a true master of the cinematic form his film have been sometimes in my opinion overlooked. But this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in.\ All the wonderful characters that existed the lifestyle the mode of dress the way they spoke OK they might be exaggerated but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts. I just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact. Can I get it somewhere on DVD? I have only seen it on TV. But for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one. ,pos
 This movie has not aged well. Maybe it's just the impact and artful characterization acting and directing that we've seen with The Sopranos but I just viewed Prizzi's Honor for the first time on DVD alone. The experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different but I have to say I was just appalled at the ending. Not just the violence of it but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending. I enjoy a good shocker but this seemed so out of character... Also when was this move supposed to be set? The cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s and yet the World Trade Center towers {completed in 1973} were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes. Another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person. Somehow mid-1980s audiences found this film charming and funny. Mid-eighties meet the late oughts: only of you can live. ,neg
 I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK. The movie was pretty terrible. All clichÃ© no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look up the technical specs on DE 529 or any Everts class Destroyer Escort and you will see what I mean. I now its black history month in the US and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this but the history of this ship is not that great. They did some escort work chased a submarine that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed. Sorry but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for. This movie makes them look like whiners. Let the name calling commence I can handle it. ,neg
 After seeing this film I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound-track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty. For at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20's music and the scratchiness of the sound-track. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so - it was the Director. I was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film. The music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. These days directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique. Unfortunately no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same. So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere) the sound-track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss. You will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound-track and certainly not a cat's meow. ,neg
 Overall I would have to say that I liked the movie. Some of the fight scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fight scene you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing. Otherwise Sammo copies Bruce Lee's fighting moves perfectly. 5 out of 10 Stars. ,pos
 I saw this film a while back and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movies' list. It is amazingly put together and what really makes the film are the detailed tid bits (such as the 'Cafe Bustelo' coffee crate being reused as a cup to wash her grandsons hair) that people aren't seeing because YOU WILL NOT UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU ARE HISPANIC. This is just one of those films that is very culturally specific and particular. Please do not bash this film if you have no prior knowledge of what foundation it's being built upon. I completely see what the writer/director was going for and he hit the target perfectly! This film is highly deserving of a better rating. ,pos
 The first step to getting off of that road that leads to nowhere is recognizing that you're on it in the first place; then it becomes a matter of being assertive and taking positive steps to overcome the negative influences in your life that may have put you on that road to begin with. Which is exactly what a young Latino girl does in `Girlfight ' written and directed by Karyn Kusama. Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) is an eighteen-year-old High School senior from the projects in Brooklyn facing expulsion after her fourth fight in the halls since the beginning of the semester. She affects a `whatever' attitude which masks a deep-seated anger that threatens to take her into places she'd rather not go. She lives with her father Sandro (Paul Calderon) with whom she has a very tentative relationship and her younger brother Tiny (Ray Santiago). With her life teetering on the brink of dissolution she desperately needs an outlet through which to channel the demons that plague her. And one day she finds it without even looking for it when she stops by the gym where Tiny trains. Ironically Tiny wants nothing to do with boxing; he wants to go to art school but Sandro is determined that his son should be able to take care of himself on the streets and pays the ten dollars a week it costs for his lessons. When Diana convinces Tiny's trainer Hector (Jaime Tirelli) to take her on and approaches her father for the money under the guise of calling it a weekly allowance (she doesn't want him to know what she wants the money for) Sandro turns her down and tells her to go out and earn her own money. Ultimately with Tiny's help she finds a way and the ring soon becomes her second home. It's an environment to which she readily adapts and it appears that her life is about to take a turn for the better. And the fact that she will have to fight men not women in `gender blind' competitions does not faze her in the least. Diana has found her element. First time writer/director Karyn Kusama has done a terrific job of creating a realistic setting for her story presenting an honest portrait of life in the projects and conveying that desperation so familiar to so many young people who find themselves in dead-end situations and on that road that leads to nowhere. And there's no candy coating on it either; as Hector tells Diana when she asks him how he came to be where he is `I was a fighter once. I lost.' Then looking around the busy gym `Like most of these guys they're going to lose too. But it's all they know--' And it's that honesty of attitude as well as the way in which the characters are portrayed that makes this movie as good as it is. It's a bleak world underscored by the dimly lit run-down gym-- you can fairly smell the sweat of the boxers-- and that sense of desolation that hangs over it all like a pall blanketing these people who are grasping and hanging on to the one and only thing they have all that they know. Making her screen debut Michelle Rodriguez is perfectly cast as Diana infusing her with a depth and brooding intensity that fairly radiates off of her in waves. She is so real that it makes you wonder how much of it is really Rodriguez; exactly where does the actor leave off and the character begin? Whatever it is it works. It's a powerful memorable performance by an actor from whom we will await another endeavor with great anticipation. She certainly makes Diana a positive role model one in whom many hopefully will find inspiration and the realization that there are alternative paths available in life at least to those who would seek them out. As positive as this film is however it ends on something of an ambiguous note; though Diana obviously has her feet on the ground there's no indication of where she's headed. Is this a short term fix for her or is she destined to become the female counterpart of Hector? After all realistically (and in light of the fact that the realism is one of the strengths of this film) professional boxing isn't exactly a profession that lends itself to nor opens it's arms to women. And in keeping with the subject matter of the film and the approach of the filmmaker an affirmation of the results of Diana's assertiveness would have been appropriate. The supporting cast includes Santiago Douglas (Adrian) Elisa Bocanegra (Marisol) Alicia Ashley (Ricki) and Thomas Barbour (Ira). Though it delivers a very real picture of life to which many will be able to identify there are certain aspects of `Girlfight ' that stretch credibility a bit regarding some of what happens in the ring. That aside it's a positive film that for the most part is a satisfying experience. I rate this one 7/10. ,pos
 The year is 1896.Jeff Webster (James Stewart) doesn't like people.There's only one friend he's got and he's Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) an old sympathetic man.They're driving a cattle herd with them.That would be their key to richness.In Skagway they run into trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the cattle.Now Jeff only has to get it back and drive it through the U.S. Canadian border to Dawson.Now they have a group of other people with them like the ladies Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet).There the two men get into the gold business.Anthony Mann's and James Stewart's fourth collaboration The Far Country (1954) is a fine western indeed.The acting work is superb.Walter Brennan makes a terrific sidekick to Stewart.Ruth Roman is brilliant and Corinne Calvet's delightful.Jay C. Flippen is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris.The great Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in smaller roles.It's fantastic to watch how Jimmy Stewart overcome's all the troubles in his way.There's just the man and his rifle.But also he's vulnerable. ,pos
 This is what makes me proud to be British. This is by far the funniest thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy dyson Steve pemberton mark gatiss and the lovely Reece shearsmith. Totally underrated this horror-comedy is perfection. The characters are iconic and the catchphrases bizarre Hello Dave . It is a comedy that everyone simply must watch. The best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh and always pushing the boundaries. It does not need to rely on catchphrases(unlike little Britain) for it to be funny. the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters shows us that they've got balls of steel. ,pos
 I loved this movie and will watch it again. Original twist to Plot of Man vs Man vs Self. I think this is Kurt Russell's best movie. His eyes conveyed more than most actors words. Perhaps there's hope for Mankind in spite of Government Intervention? ,pos
 The movie was OK . Not bad not good just OK. If there was anything else in the theater this would be skipped by far. Sadly Fast and Furious 2 also stunk but I'd rather see this than FF2. :) If you have a fetish for harrison ford or that other young punk this will be a cute movie for you. Personally I'd wait for HBO or Blockbuster. ,neg
 Eric Stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident. While learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition Joel befriends slick fast-talking charming womanizer Raymond (an amazing Wesley Snipes) and boorish surly racist biker Bloss (a terrific William Forsythe) who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients he's forced to share a room with. Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving but married girlfriend Anna (radiantly played by Helen Hunt). But he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own. This remarkable movie's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through. Directors Neil Jimenez (who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script) and Micheal Steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste wit and warmth specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one's lifestyle including and especially your sex life (this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when Joel and Anna try and fail to make love in a motel room). Besides the expected poignancy the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw earthy humor that's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with Joel and Bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club. The uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus: Stoltz Snipes Forsythe and Hunt are all outstanding with stand-out supporting turns by Grace Zabriskie as Bloss' doting amiable mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as compassionate hospital nurses. Despite the grim subject matter the film ultimately proves to be a very moving positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit. A simply wonderful little gem of a drama. ,pos
 In all truth this really isn't a movie so much as an extended final episode; by this I mean that had you NOT followed the TV series (Homicide: Life On The Street) I suspect that you would have a hard time following this made-for-tv movie. Having said that Homicide: The Movie is still a great watch. I think it says a lot about a television production that EVERY single cast member would return many after years of absence to once again portray their characters and bring closure to an incredible program. The movie brings out that sense of family not only amongst the characters but amongst the actors as well. It's all very bitter-sweet knowing that this will be the LAST time we will see them all together again under the title of HOMICIDE. Story-wise I found this film somewhat lacking. Giardello's mayoral candidacy seems particularly contrived and I felt his shooting could've been dealt with within the parameters of his regular position as Leiutenant. Also Det. Bayliss's extreme plot twist which was left hanging at series end is finally resolved but I for one NEVER felt that it needed to be; I enjoyed being left with a mystery (let us recall that the very first episode's first case also went unsolved for the entire series run!). As a DEVOTED fan of the TV series I can love this movie and the fact that it even got made after H:LOTS had been canceled but I would not recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the slightest exposure to the series. Now if they'd just release it on DVD... ,pos
 I think that deep down in the darkest slimiest part of their heart everyone likes Jerry Springer just a little bit. While his show is undeniably offensive and stupid it also gives us a chance to see that relatively speaking most of us have it real good. When you look at the trailer park livin' dollar whiskey drinkin' incest lovin' people on the Springer show it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park. Jerry is performing a public service and we should be grateful. He ditched a political career to host the show just for us. What we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie Ringmaster . Ringmaster shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show or so they would like us to think. The movie follows the pre-requisite Springer story line: Love triangles. One triangle involves Connie her daughter Angel and her husband Rusty. The other involves Starletta Vonda and Demond. When the two hapless groups meet up in LA their lives intertwine and collide head-on all culminating in an explosive episode of the Springer show. It's like what Short Cuts would be if Robert Altman had had a severe crack habit. Ringmaster is true to the show as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish. It also makes me very glad that I don't live in the squalor it's characters do. But the movie has a problem. It's billed as a comedy but it just isn't very funny. What laughs there are to be had are few and far between. Maybe some people watch this and laugh non-stop. If you think blow jobs and rape are funny well then I guess you're one of those folks. Personally I laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of white-trash life. The Jerry Springer Show just isn't meant to make the leap from TV to the silver screen. What's funny in an hour long show (less when you count commercials) isn't necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie. Movies have to tell a story and that's something else Ringmaster has trouble with. The story is threadbare. There are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder. And even if there weren't such problems how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story? Even the Hollywood formula couldn't make this better. Ringmaster: is so bad it even screws up the best part of the Springer show: the Final Thought. Somehow even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built around. The worst offender in all of this is Springer himself. He's such a bad actor that he can't even play himself convincingly. Watching Springer play Springer is sad. It's like he was going for a 'What if Woody Allen played Jerry Springer' vibe and he failed. Miserably. He went to the trouble of producing this disaster the least he could do is try to make it just that much better. Not that I'm saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance. Just the opposite. They all suck. Not so surprisingly no one in this movie went on to greatness. The best any of them was did was Molly Hagan landing a job on a Nickelodeon sitcom. Apparently Nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the '90's to star in a children's program. It makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pasts. Here are my Final Thoughts: What we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience. Should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely brain-damaged lumps of goo? I say no. Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed up world there is a perfect movie for each of us. We just have to keep looking for it. Until next time take care of yourselves and your loved ones. And don't ever watch Ringmaster . ,neg
 If Ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received. Instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in said their lines and picked up their paychecks without much conviction. Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in East Africa. Along comes Peter Ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a Moslem slave dealer. As Johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well. Of course Caine doesn't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast has such folks as William Holden Rex Harrison Omar Sharif and Indian film star Kebir Bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing. Usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery. But Ashanti doesn't even have that going for it. What an incredible waste of time. The aroma of tax write off is permeating the air. ,neg
 This 30 minute documentary BuÃ±uel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films. First let's admit that 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that BuÃ±uel favored but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene the narrator chides that in school children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people the horror!. BuÃ±uel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school? Doesn't BuÃ±uel understand that it is the lack of modern technology that has made them poor in comparison with other people? ,neg
 For the life of me I cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the Jerry Springer Show . It's so incrediably trashy. Some ways sadly it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's pretty bad. I will admit that. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So I would recommend skipping Ringmaster . Just watch the Jerry Springer Show . It's more enjoyable than this. 2/10 ,neg
 Any one who has seen Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and was bothered by the gory violence would want to see this film instead. Though it wasn't a success in th box office or TV ratings The Fox Movie Channel still finds a real good motive to show this anually. I liked the way that they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew.Though Sarandon didn't have long hair like any other Jesus would in other films his looks are pretty close to what a Jewish man would appear. What surprised me or startled me was the scene where Caiaphas told Jesus about Pilate And don't ever forget that you are a Jew! Though that may have not been a racist remark Colin Blakely was trying to make Chris Sarandon look like garbage in the eyes of the prominent men of those days.Keith Michell's portrayal of Pilate was hulking comparing with his previous performances in The Story of Jacob and Joseph and The Story of David . But if you compare his portrayal of Pilate with Telly Savala's or Hurd Hatfield you can say that he really painted well the impression of a Roman procurator. ,pos
 I am a fan of the previous Best of the Best films. But this one was awful. No wonder I had such a hard time finding it. I tried 4 video rental stores until I found one with a copy of this movie. The acting was terrible the plot was a joke and the action was bad as well. I really miss Alex Grady Travis Brigley and the original kickboxing characters and theme that this film had with the first 2 movies. John ,neg
 #1 Vampires vs. Humans #2 Military-reject roughneck squad as first responders to dangerous unknown Vampire incursions. #3 Sexy female Vampire on the side of the good guys . #4 Plenty of gore and action. There are four (4) major plot devices that may help you decide if you want to watch this movie. If you want all four then the next plot device may not deter you... #5 In outer space. That last one almost got me too but I'm glad I watched. In a pile of terrible direct-to-video horror that is the Sci-Fi channel Halloween marathon... this movie is a breath of fresh air. It will stand-up against any of the other Sci-Fi channel offerings and even against the other Vampire movie Natassia starred in (who keeps giving Uwe Boll money?). ,neg
 I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen. After the original film we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. Jane's skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically but also quite sexually in love. One's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality. The skin show in this film is off the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff leg and hip baring costume she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan. (although it is not O'Sullivan but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene) Weissmuller also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth. The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips. It's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie. ,pos
 I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel The Postman Always Rings Twice (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights) but the resulting movie is definitely interesting. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best) but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very sensual couple) it is a must for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. The film is not perfect though. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested. Anyhow as much as I like this film and the remakes I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book. ,pos
 This so-called prequel is just a badly made remake to to a better version of Dangerous Liasons. The plots are identical as is most of the script. I loved the book its based off of and I loved the first movie but I'm not even going to bother with the 3rd movie. The pointless banter between the two main characters in the prequel was completely predictable and unoriginal and...I just can't stress how bad the movie was. If you don't want to take my word for it just watch it and you'll see what I mean. If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE! Although the plot is not even as good. They took so many lines from the first movie Its hard to tell which movie you're watching. ,neg
 The makers of this fine film did a terrific job of getting you involved with the characters as they suffered through this horrible ordeal.The horrific scene in the woods was done so superbly that you forget that these men were just actors playing parts.I have never gotten so immersed in a film as I have this one.Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight were never better on screen as well as fine performances by Ned Beatty Ronny Cox Bill McKinney and though he appeared only briefly James Dickey the man who authored the book upon which the film is based as the sheriff of Aintry.It is somewhat disturbing and kids of course should be shielded from it but this is great dramatic cinema. ,pos
 I've just seen The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it quite good. This was George Sanders's first appearance as the Saint where he replaces Louis Hayward. In this one the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting at a night club. With the help of his acquaintance Inspector Fernack who has come down from New York they help a daughter of a crime boss. Joining Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. Not a bad Saint movie. Worth seeing. Rating: 3 stars out of 5. ,pos
 Due to reading bad reviews and being told by friends that they couldn't believe how bad it was I didn't go and see this film at the cinema. After watching it on DVD I have to say I regret that now. I'm not saying it is brilliant but I would venture to say that it is a good movie. I enjoyed it. People have skulls thicker than Ned's helmet if they go to see a movie like this and expect it to be a documentary. If you read up the actual history behind most movies based on historical figures there is usually a huge difference between the fact and the fictional portrayal. I don't think Ganghis Kahn has ever once been portrayed even remotely close to historical fact. What kind of man Ned Kelly actually was is a matter of debate and quite passionate it seems. In spite of the efforts of governments and some historians Ned Kelly has become a legend. Legends are stories and stories say as much about those who tell and listen to them as they do about the actual figure himself. Ned Kelly has become such a popular identity because he does represent that aspect of Australian culture that doesn't trust or accept authority. A society in which there is no dissent or challenge to authority is crazier and more dangerous than any bushranger. So not expecting this to be an accurate recreation of the historical Kelly gang I actually found it a surprisingly unencumbered and refreshing movie. It was sentimental and romantic but thankfully not anywhere as cheesy as it could have been; for my fellow Australians watch 'The Lighthorseman' and you will see what I mean (it is a pity the way that story was treated so poorly). Perhaps the love affair business could have been forsaken for a bit more detail in other areas such as the shooting of the troopers. Ironically I actually enjoyed the movie because of that because it would be those details that most of the focus on Ned's story would dwell. And they are the details of the story that are best discovered by reading the different viewpoints given by the various historians. This movie was always going to have a hard time having make a compromise of appealing to a global movie market (to pay the pills) and the legend as it means to Australians; perhaps a little of Ned's spirit is in this movie because I think it rebelled against people's expectations and unfortunately missed both targets. Fortunately it made for an enjoyable quirk of a film. For me it was an unexpected kind of movie about Ned and that is why I liked it. Orlando Bloom's performance did a lot for the movie too - he really added something. I think he would have enjoyed being the monster instead of the pretty elf for a change. When you consider some other movies that are far worse than this one your opinion of this movie should be reconsidered. Send me this on DVD for christmas rather than Croc Dundee or The Man From Snowy River anytime. ,pos
 I rarely write reviews for IMDb.com but I feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible. Just terrible. I like Shaw Bros. movies (I'm not a hater.) and I had high expectations for this one since I found it listed on many 10 Best Kung Fu/Martial Arts Movies websites. (I'm now convinced that those 10 Best lists are all cut-and-paste jobs.) First of all there's barely any action in the film. Most of the movie consists of talking about the plot which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best. And the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978 but it's routine by today's standards. A special warning to Netflix users: the DVD they ship is terrible; the picture is horrendous and it's not even 16:9 enhanced. ,neg
 It is always a nice suprise when a film made for TV turns out to be entertaining such as Little Richard. This is a very watchable film about the story of Rock and Roller Little Richard played by an actor called Leon who i have never seen before but does an very good job. As most TV films this is a little tamer than if made for Cinema which is a shame because i am sure there is lot we could have seen about Little Richard that was controversial. Instead we see a lot religous rubbish which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoilt a very promising career. All in all this film is good and the acting is above average fot a TV film. 7 out of 10. ,pos
 Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event even though he did save many other captive children. The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways bathrooms and even class rooms. In other words the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren (Sam Decker) plays the soldier/school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field. However the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB. Try to enjoy it if you decided to View IT ! ,neg
 This movie goes beyond just being bad it is definitively the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film (if you can call it that). ,neg
 Ed Harris's work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence that is he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it and that includes the formidable Sean Connery. The movie which is more than a bit sanctimonious comes alive only in the scenes when Harris is interrogated by the attorney for another convict. It is breathtaking a master class in artistic control. The other cast members are all adept and Connery is reliable as is Fishbourne but the story itself packs no wallop. The plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be mistreated and coerced by white law enforcement officers. This is the engine which drives the story right or wrong and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end. Still worth watching to see Harris in action. ,pos
 William Russ is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. But he tries to keep away from his family. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in playing several different roles to convince him to come home. The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But William Russ wasn't truly a star. However it appears his acting is still OK. I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that. Overall it was a sub-par movie. In a letter grading system it would receive a D . ,neg
 'The Last Wave' is far more than the sum of its parts. It's not merely a disaster film not simply an exploration into Australian Aboriginal spirituality and certainly more than a simple court drama. Writer/Director Peter Weir manages to take these elements to the next level to produce a truly effective and thought-provoking film with the same eerie atmosphere he gave to 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' two years earlier that you will continue to remember years later. When lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) over the death of an Aboriginal for which he may or may not be directly responsible he finds himself not merely struggling to get the truth from Lee but making sense of what he hears when it does come. As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the Dreamtime the truth exists on two completely different levels with ramifications more disastrous than Burton could ever have imagined. No doubt the reason why 'Picnic At Hanging Rock' is better remembered is because of its enduring mystery. We are led along the same path but forced to find answers for ourselves. In 'The Last Wave' we can piece everything together by the end of the film. However even with all the information we have to choose how much of it we want to believe because the film takes us beyond the borders of our normal realities. On the production side Weir uses his budget to great effect progressively building a sense of doom in everything from soft lighting to heavy rain to good use of sound. The incidental music is unobtrusive never trying to be grandiose. Richard Chamberlain manages to convey the bafflement the audience would doubtless feel as he tries to unravel the mystery. David Gulpilil excellently portrays a man trapped between two worlds wanting to do the right thing but afraid because he already knows the ending. Put all these things together and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a familiar name in cinema thirty years on. Strongly recommended. ,pos
 Wrapped in gorgeous English country backgrounds Emma is a delicious confection to be relished for dreamy getaways. Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a graceful intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess--and confidant--to a marriage which Emma takes the credit in matchmaking. Eager to use her talent in arranging things for the people around her she decides to match the vicar Mr. Elton (Alan Cummings) with her pretty young friend Harriet (Toni Collette). The result is a series of mixed signals and mistaken interpretations that end up sorting themselves out with Emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought. The film is full of Jane Austen's witty and wry characterizations. Gwyneth Paltrow is at her best portraying this maiden of a restrained polite society with wit and ease. Her growing romance with the unparalleled Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) is the heart of this film. Mr. Knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films. He is incredibly handsome in a modest relaxed way that is irresistible. He is certainly well-matched to Gwyneth Paltrow. Their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an infant has blossomed as he a family friend matches wits with her in an older brotherly fashion that grows into something more. With a wry look or understated jab at Emma Northam's Knightley is a delight to watch. Other wonderful characterizations include the comic Juliet Stevenson Greta Scacchi Ewan McGregor Polly Walker and the talkative spinster Miss Bates who is very funny. Seeming shorter and more flowing than most Jane Austin adaptations Emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment. ,pos
 I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format. Columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past. And that is the disturbing point because Columbo is no ordinary detective. There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing. First I can't figure out the title of this movie. It is misleading. Maybe a better title would've been The Vanishing Bride or something similar. Second Columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason (to the viewers at least) why he does it. I don't feel betrayed just disappointed. I'm glad Peter Falk went back to the usual Columbo. ,neg
 ELEPHANT WALK may not be the acme of literature or of film but it is great entertainment in the quasi-melodramatic mode. It is the story of love both genuine and illicit as well as overweening ambition devotion and the arrogance of personal tyranny. A previous reviewer John Mankin questions why the central focus of the film the mansion called Elephant Walk should have been built by the former owner the governor the late Tom Wiley right across the elephants' traditional path to the major source of water the river. To miss this point is to essentially miss the point of the whole center of the film: the hubris of man. That his son played by Peter Finch should become enthralled by the super image and enigma of his revered father is not unexpected since the son was without a mother growing up in a foreign jungle with only his father and his father's rowdy 'boys' club' as his role models. The point of the father was that he was a self-made man who would tame nature to his liking and that liking was not just a tea plantation upon the lands the elephants once dominated but also that he would dominate even the large bull elephant that led the herd and thus he would dominate his son and all around him and so we join the tale after the elephants have been denied the crucial dry season access to their pathway to water. Who could know that this dry season would last so long and what the elephants would do in desperation to get water? This is the nexus of the film: what will animals do to get water; what will humans do to get power or love? Ceylon today's Sri Lanka is the huge island off the coast of India where the plantation is located and one quickly learns that it is the real scenery of the story not just the expenses of Miss Taylor. Were it not for this exotic location (much of the film was shot in Ceylon) and the magnificent bungalow this would have been just another potboiler. One must recognize the atmosphere created here as integral to the time and place as it illuminates the latter day wealth and power attained by the English immigrant 'conquerors' that were part and parcel of the British raj. It is only such wealth gained by the use of virtual slave labor that one could build so magnificent a residence of ebony teak and marble. Not to be overlooked are the wonderfully carved Jalees (grille work window and doorway borders) evidently specified by art directors J. McMillan Johnson and Hal Pereira and obviously made by the cheaper labor on the island. Such craftsmanship reveals the careful attention to detail that these men sought. For those immune to the blandishments of time place and architecture there is always the allure of Miss Taylor as she marries a man she doesn't really know and is tacitly wooed by a another man against the background described and under the overarching tyranny of the legacy of a man deceased. As I said it is not great literature nor even great film but it is great spectacle long before that term was debased by the special effects extravaganzas of today. This is one of those films made to be seen on the giant screen of an outdoor drive-in not on the home TV so arrange the largest screen to see it on to fully appreciate its fine camera-work and scope. ,pos
 Ok after reading a couple of reviews on Atlantis: The Lost Empire I just want to clear up some misunderstanding as to it being a direct rip off from Nadia: Secret of the Blue Water. The only part that was a ripoff from Nadia is that the pendant from Nadia and the pendant from Atlantis bear so much resemblence in terms of how it's used origins and how it's created from the source of life that there's no doubt about it being copied. If you want to consider how Kida and Nadia is dressed alike then you could put that against Disney too(It was kind of wierd for Nadia and Kida to wear that bikini style clothing in an adventure sci-fi not to mention they both move in a similar style too). As an anime fan I have to agree there's some degree of copying but it's only on the minor details and even though not many of the ideas are original (like the encryption design on the wall in Laputa the ancient mask from Princess Mononoke the resemblence of the vehicles to the Garfish submarine in Nadia etc)...The plot itself I believe it's highly original and it's quite amazing that Disney can pull it off without the use of Captain Nemo(the main character in Jules Verne's 20k Leagues Under the Sea which is also the main character in Nadia). As for Mylo and Jean wearing similar style glasses...As shown in the novel Lord of the Flies glasses is a symbol of wisdom and intelligence. I think Mylo Jean the main character from Stargate and a dozen of other INTELLIGENT characters would look kind of unfit for the role if they went in without glasses. As for the submarines and how the submarines fight(with those wide blast torpedos which really resembles what Nautilius does) I want to state that it's a required element for either one if Atlantis is involved in the plot(after all it's a sunken city beneath the waters). As for the crew having some charactistical resemblence with the crew from Nautilius in Nadia it might be the artwork but I don't sense any copyright infringement there as the character's personalities were perfectly original to me. As an anime fan that rated Nadia as the #1 best anime I ever watched even now today. I do have my doubts about Atlantis when I first saw the preview. But now that I watched the movie I once again regained my confidence with Disney and have high hopes for their future movies after Atlantis. Overall the best Disney movie yet without me shivering at the sound of their songs at the middle of the movie and it's a plus that they revised their cheesy scripts to make it even better. Also it's amazing that they actually portray the bad guys look normal with out making them overly evil in the beginning (I was wondering who the bad guys are and only the blonde girl kind of resemble the looks of a bad character in terms of how Disney draws it aka make the bad guys look really menacing) ,pos
 This is the worst film I have ever seen.I was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough. The plot was bad and there wasn't a single likeable character.I could get more entertainment watching static. I gave this movie a 1 only because the scale didn't go into negative numbers. Avoid this movie at all costs. ,neg
 Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after WWII. Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured Winchester 73 going to the winner. This is a good script with several stories going on at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Thank God with in a few years we would begin to let Indians play themselves in western films. The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona. I would not put Winchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach High Noon or Shane but it gets an above average recommendation from me. . ,pos
 What's not to like about this movie? Every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. A very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him. What is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined. Only if. Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. It was a fun and funny movie. ,pos
 We expected something great when we went to see this bomb. It is basically a Broadway play put on film. The music is plain terrible. There isn't one memorable song in the movie -- heard any hits from this movie? You won't because there aren't any. Some of the musical numbers go on so long that I got up to go to the restroom and get some pop corn and it was still going when I got back! If they were good songs well -- but they suck. The pace is slow terrible character development. The lead was praised for her singing but sounded like she screamed every song -- it was almost impossible to stand. This movie has NOTHING to offer anyone but die-hard Broadway enthusiasts. This is without a doubt the most over rated movie I've seen in my entire life. A complete waist of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this movie except Danny Glover -- who wasn't on screen enough and whose character wasn't developed enough. Rent the video and you'll agree -- this movie was an expensive over produced polished dog do. ,neg
 Excellent. Gritty and true portrayal of pioneer ranch life on the Western plains with an emphasis on the woman's role and place. A moving film lovingly made and based on real people and their actual experiences. Low budget independent film; never made any money. Definitely not the romanticized unrealistic Hollywood version of pioneer life. ,pos
 There have been several films about Zorro some even made in Europe e.g. Alain Delon. This role has also been played by outstanding actors such as Tyrone Power and Anthony Hopkins but to me the best of all times has always been Reed Hadley. This serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western where you will only discover the real villain Don del Oro at its end. The serial also has good performance of various actors of movies B like Ed Cobb ex- Tarzan Jim Pierce C. Montague Shaw eternal villains like John Merton and Charles King and a very good performance of Hadley as Zorro. He was quick smart used well his whip and sword and his voice was the best for any Zorro. ,pos
 This was so far the worst movie I have seen in my entire life and I have seen some REALLY bad movies. I saw this movie at my local video store and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? The filming of the movie was scattered and boring. At one point there is a one-minute scene of no one talking just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring with annoying unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of. If you rent this movie watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. Otherwise when you see this movie run. ,neg
 Absolutely fantastic. Now before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattÃ©s allow me to elaborate. Much as I enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film I've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. Of course they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence. The plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes whilst undoubtedly brutal were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is abducted imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. Whilst there really are very very few positives to draw from this film its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. Within twenty minutes the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. For my part I came out flushed with laughter buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making. Whichever way you look at it this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film. P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film free...so I can afford to laugh about it. I was still tempted to ask for my money back...it really was THAT bad. ,neg
 In the days before gore and sex took over real horror films were made. Castle of Blood is in my estimation one of the finest although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings. In an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent The Others which was in the theaters a couple of years ago. Director Antonio Margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time Web of the Spider (AKA Nella Stretta Morsa del Ragno). Why he did this I do not understand although the remake starred Anthony Franciosa and Klaus Kinski and was very good in its own right. Perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to American audiences. I do not really know. It is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color. Castle of Blood is excellent Italian Gothic. La Danza Macabra is said to be an unpublished work of Edgar Allen Poe who appears in this film. Poe and Lord Blackwood owner of a haunted castle bet American writer Alan Foster (George Riviere) that he cannot spend All Souls Night in said castle and survive. Foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts. It seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re-enact the crimes they committed in life. Lord Blackwood conveniently forgot to tell Foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next All Souls Night! It does not take Foster and the beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood (portrayed by the incomparable Barbara Steele) long to fall in love even though their romance is doomed because Elisabeth is one of the ghosts. I will not give the ending away but will just say that Castle of Blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story. Comments. This film is greatly atmospheric even by the excellent standards of the Italians. My personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this. In fairness Web of the Spider was fine in its own right even with color and greater brightness. I loved the lingering shots something most modern day directors do not have the patience for. Indeed when Alan first enters the doomed castle we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms. By the time the first ghost appears the audience is thoroughly primed and ready. There is wonderful dialogue between Alan and the ghosts something else not often done in standard ghost stories. There are also memorable scenes very visual for this type of film. Elisabeth's murder and the dance scene (reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962's Carnival of Souls) were particularly good. Sadly few general interest viewers will ever hear of much less see this film. That is a shame for this one is a cut above the rest. I got my copy from Sinister Cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else. For persons interested in this genre it is a must see. ,neg
 This film is not funny. It is not entertaining. It does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation. Added to that it's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory. It's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like. This movie is boring obnoxiously mind-numbing and at times offensive and disgusting. At most it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. Also it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time. ,neg
 This Lifetime style movie takes the middle aged divorcee victim who then finally fights back genre to new depths of cartoon-like absurdity. Here the 40 something stay-at-home ex-wife of a successful lawyer protagonist (daughter away at college) is starting a new life after her divorce helped by a female college friend in opening a new dress shop as a sort of franchise expansion deal. She has even started up a friendship with her attractive slightly younger perhaps landscape architect / gardener (who's black). But then horror of middle-aged women's horrors ANOTHER 20 something female she took on as a tenant to let a room to starts 'taking over her life. What this new younger woman threat really does is mildly flirt with the gardener and offer him a glass of wine that * gasp * really belonged to the divorcee!! She runs up the utility bills by not turning down the thermostat!! And backed up the toilet! And leaves old food gone bad in the refrigerator! And hangs her pieces of (African) artwork in the living room!! And so on. Well she may have killed the cat as well. Yeah ok the extent to which this one does these things is bad enough but its more than a little ridiculous especially as it turns into a campaign. The character reality is that any tiny part of this would drive this particular prissy woman insane. (So why did she rent the room -- and to horror of horrors a much younger woman?) Supposedly this increasingly arrogant (natch) younger woman has a mania for seizing control. And our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil (and erotically hot looking of course) 20 something. But there's this problem. Anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her POWER -- and just flirts or has sex with some guy and escapes the consequences. (Well there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings. It just isn't * generally * used in quite this sort of way.) The premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her. Of course the 40 something doesn't know about these things and the 20 something has had help. The lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period with utilities thrown in at the fixed price. Even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something. You know the judge is sympathetic to all the woe-is-me of the sexy sweet young thing. Finally the 40 something's heroic battle back for THE HOUSE then begins. Woopie!! The only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy TRO's (or orders of protection) are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so -- although they are generally only this easy against men. They are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here. Indeed girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats and sometimes without even hearing his side. Even when there is a hearing it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats (to prove a negative) when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused rather than the accuser. (This is one of the only areas of American law where that is true -- and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller.) Of course that's not likely to be the subject of any Lifetime movie in this lifetime. The absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic and isn't taking her medicine. Even so it makes no sense. She isn't after the successful lawyer ex-husband though she does con his help (to the ex wife's fury) in her quest. She's after THE HOUSE (technically to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease). This second younger woman is after ALL THAT'S LEFT after the divorce after affairs with other 20 somethings STOLE her husband!! (The ex-husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling -- doesn't matter he still strayed!!!) The protagonist is good enough looking for her age. But her outlook attitude and focus is so small minded frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her. Well a core group of Lifetime fans care I guess judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it. (I kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal. I couldn't resist seeing just how far they'd take it.) ** Spoiler ** (if such a thing is possible with this flick). Well here's a clue. The movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to listen to her 20 something male co-worker and sometimes lover and do whatever he says and let him take care of her (he means get her to keep taking her medicine) -- and then tricking him and returning to THE HOUSE. There she climbs the stairs with a knife demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something who is taking a bath by candlelight secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life. There's a struggle -- and the 40 something mom wins -- by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti-psychotic medicine she had found. She then begins stroking her mom like and the two women have a bonding female solidarity moment!!! How sweet. ,neg
 Quentin Crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully one is a romantic. When things are show unbearably grim they are realistic. And when something gets the ironic treatment they're spot on. Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa he falls into the second catagory. This director has obviously tried too hard to make a Spanish Ken Loach type movie without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that elevate Loach movies from merely being 'depressing'. Los Lunes al Sol is just that only depressing. Things are unrealistically grim. The characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point and if the glum story isn't enough Aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette. The films was ridiculously over-rated at the Goyas. A movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society in this case unemployed harbour workers does not automatically make for a good movie even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people. This movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate. In 21st century Spain unemployed people do not live like beggars and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms and it's hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it. Leon de Aranoa obviously doesn't have a clue about working class Spain and does it no favours. Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw. The scene where the men watch a football match for free has been directly copied from a film which deals much more 'realistically' with the subject of the 'poverty' trap namely Purely Belter which is afar more engaging humorous and yet sad. ,neg
 Darius Goes West is the touching story of a brave teen coping with Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy and his personal quest to see the Pacific Ocean. He receives help and encouragement from a group of young men who love and care for him while going on this quest. The story has a natural drama and honest portrayal of the commitment of young people to help one of their own stricken with this incurable disease. Anyone who thinks young people are self-centered and narcissistic will find this movie to turn that stereotype on its head. It is the power of the young people and their engagement with Darius' plight that is very compelling in this documentary. ,pos
 The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Really this episode is the exact same content as the DVD pilot release. That having been said episode 01 gives a very substantive background of the very popular Battlestar Galactica series (both the original and the 2007 remake). It significantly applies most to the 2007 series. As is the trending plots of sci-fi of late this series explores Virtual life or environment. On top of this we are given much background on the Adama family line as well as their relationship with the unrevealed (in the Battlestar Galactica series) creator of the Cylons. To the most part this first episode revolves around the popular topic of Virtual life and (as is expected) early life of the colonies and the birth of the Cylons. Over all I rather enjoyed this episode. Although it was not new material for myself or anyone that has already seen the DVD release of the Caprica pilot the series seems very promising. As is the case with many pilots episode 01 leaves us with a cliff-hanger so to ensure a follow by an audience (sci-fi community). I'm definitely going to keep watching for resolve as well as development. I give this series 8 stars. ,pos
 I thought this movie was very well done. Taking place in the mid 1950's everything looked accurate to me. It was well cast and believable. I don't usually care much for this type of movie because they just don't have any depth but I felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt you got to really know them and care about them. It did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time. This movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups. After the movie was over I wished there was a part two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on TV or rent it... ,pos
 Have never understood why the MacDonald-Eddy swan song has always been panned so mercilessly--not just by their detractors but by virtually everyone. To me I Married an Angel is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo's more celebrated outings. The sets and costumes are as lavish as any to be found in an MGM musical the script is by the reliable Anita Loos ( San Francisco The Women Gentlemen Prefer Blondes etc.) the Rodgers and Hart tunes (albeit altered a bit by MacDonald-Eddy regulars Bob Wright and Chet Forrest) are given celestial treatment by Herbert Stothart (Oscar-winner for scoring The Wizard of Oz ) and best of all the singing sweethearts look great in their contemporary clothes and seem to be having fun with the bizarre proceedings. Try to show Rose Marie or Sweethearts to the uninitiated today and they may very well have a hard time sitting still but this offbeat fast-paced fantasy is bound to entertain. ,pos
 ELVIRA MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) directed by: James Signorelli starring: Cassandra Peterson W. Morgan Sheppard Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) quits her TV show and heads to the small Christian town Fallwell Massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt's inheritance hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in Vegas. Unfortunately for her all she gets is a creepy old house a poodle and a magic cookbook. While in Fallwell Elvira tries to make money breathe some life into the teenagers win the heart of a stud (Daniel Greene) avoid being burned at the stake and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) who is planning to use the book to end the world. my thoughts: I love both Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful beautiful and funny woman and as Elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers. In this movie her charms are put to good use. I loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film. You got Elvira with her low-cut black dress her big black hair and her enormous 'twins' and she's in a Christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup. This also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) a lot more entertaining. W. Morgan Sheppard is equally great as Elvira's uncle/nemesis Vincent out to steal the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from Elvira. What really makes the film is not the plot but the many jokes. Everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a SCARY MOVIE sequel. I hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film and any fan of Roger Corman B-horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film. If you love Elvira you will love this flick. Also check out ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS. ,pos
 The Wicker Man. I am so angry that I cannot write a proper comment about this movie. The plot was ridiculous thinly tied together and altogether-just lame. Nicolas Cage...shame on you! I assumed that since you were in it that it would be at least decent. It was not. I felt like huge parts of the movie had been left on the cutting room floor and even if it's complete-the movie was just outlandish and silly. At the end you're left mouth agape mind befuddled and good taste offended. I have never heard so many people leave a theater on opening day with so much hatred. People were complaining about it in small groups in the mall four floors down from the theater near the entrance. It's that bad. I heard it compared to : Glitter American Werewolf in Paris and Gigli. My boyfriend was so mad he wouldn't even talk about it. Grrrr! ,neg
 This movie does not really promote kids to be nicer and have better attitudes as a family movie should and this wouldn't be considered family anyway because it has some things in it that children shouldn't be seeing. Not the best ABC Family film if you ask me. If there were less sexual themes in the movie then maybe it would be better. Hollywood isn't doing anything to make a movie better by adding in sexual situations. There's really no reason for them. At least this is a TV movie. I wouldn't want to waste my money on this garbage by renting it. If you have other things to do other than watch this movie please proceed to them. ,neg
 By the numbers story of the Kid (Prince) a singer on his way to becoming a star. Then he falls in love with Apollonia (Appolonia Kotero). But he has to deal with his wife-beating father (Clarence Williams III!) and his own self-destructive behavior. I saw this in a theatre in 1984. I was no big fan of Prince but I did like the three big songs from this movie-- Purple Rain Let's Get Crazy and When Doves Cry . The concert scenes in this movie are great--full of energy and excitement. Unfortunately that's a VERY small portion of the movie. The story is screamingly obvious and have been done many times before--and much better too. The subplots are to put in nicely badly handled. The love triangle between The Kid Appolonia and Morris Day was so predictable and tired that I actually became insulted. His wife beating father is needed for the story but the scenes are so badly handled (in acting and direction) that I couldn't believe it. The script is terrible--lousy dialogue and some truly painful comedy routines. And there's tons of misogyny here--The Kid's mother getting beaten; The Kid hitting Appolonia and (for no reason) Appolonia strips and goes topless to swim in a dirty river. Also Williams' and Princes' characters treat women in a horrible manner constantly. The acting is where this movie REALLY fails. Appolonia is sweet and beautiful--but no actor. And Prince is (easily) the WORST actor I've ever seen. His blank face and wooden dialogue delivery are so bad I couldn't believe it. This movie only comes to life during the concert scenes but there aren't really that many. The dramatic scenes are so badly acted and handled that they make this movie a chore to sit through. They should have just made this a concert film. I give this a 2--only for the music. ,neg
 I just watched The Incredible Melting Man for the second time and it was even more boring than when I first watched it. I don't understand why it has become such a 'cult classic' when it is so tediously dull. The opening scene looks promising when the fat nurse drops the canister of blood and runs for her dear life. After this all that really happens is the melting man stalks around some woods and houses whilst having flashbacks of his life as an astronaut. The makeup is quite good and his melting gooey face looks fairly realistic. There is a cool scene where he throws a mans head in a river and it floats until it reaches a waterfall where it falls on rocks and bursts open. There's not much to wet yourself over though most scenes are shot in darkness and you can't really see what is happening. There isn't much gore at least in the Vipco DVD I watched. No The Incredible Melting Man is not that great at all. I'll give it marks for its cheese factor but that's about it. If you want a TRUE sci-fi/horror cult classic watch The Deadly Spawn instead! ,neg
 A must see movie for anyone who ever went to camp or wanted to. This film captures the absolute essence of what summer camp is all about. It is funny it is compassionate it makes you want to watch more about the characters once the credits begin to role. If you have not seen this movie..what are you doing? get off you butt and run the video store. Have a great summer :) ,pos
 Who are these They - the actors? the filmmakers? Certainly couldn't be the audience- this is among the most air-puffed productions in existence. It's the kind of movie that looks like it was a lot of fun to shootÂ— TOO much fun nobody is getting any actual work done and that almost always makes for a movie that's no fun to watch. Ritter dons glasses so as to hammer home his character's status as a sort of doppleganger of the bespectacled Bogdanovich; the scenes with the breezy Ms. Stratten are sweet but have an embarrassing look-guys-I'm-dating-the-prom-queen feel to them. Ben Gazzara sports his usual cat's-got-canary grin in a futile attempt to elevate the meager plot which requires him to pursue Audrey Hepburn with all the interest of a narcoleptic at an insomnia clinic. In the meantime the budding couple's respective children (nepotism alert: Bogdanovich's daughters) spew cute and pick up some fairly disturbing pointers on 'love' while observing their parents. (Ms. Hepburn drawing on her dignity manages to rise above the proceedings- but she has the monumental challenge of playing herself ostensibly.) Everybody looks great but so what? It's a movie and we can expect that much if that's what you're looking for you'd be better off picking up a copy of Vogue. Oh- and it has to be mentioned that Colleen Camp thoroughly annoys even apart from her singing which while competent is wholly unconvincing... the country and western numbers are woefully mismatched with the standards on the soundtrack. Surely this is NOT what Gershwin (who wrote the song from which the movie's title is derived) had in mind; his stage musicals of the 20's may have been slight but at least they were long on charm. They All Laughed tries to coast on its good intentions but nobody- least of all Peter Bogdanovich - has the good sense to put on the brakes. Due in no small part to the tragic death of Dorothy Stratten this movie has a special place in the heart of Mr. Bogdanovich- he even bought it back from its producers then distributed it on his own and went bankrupt when it didn't prove popular. His rise and fall is among the more sympathetic and tragic of Hollywood stories so there's no joy in criticizing the film... there _is_ real emotional investment in Ms. Stratten's scenes. But Laughed is a faint echo of The Last Picture Show Paper Moon or What's Up Doc - following Daisy Miller and At Long Last Love it was a thundering confirmation of the phase from which P.B. has never emerged. All in all though the movie is harmless only a waste of rental. I want to watch people having a good time I'll go to the park on a sunny day. For filmic expressions of joy and love I'll stick to Ernest Lubitsch and Jaques Demy... ,neg
 Sadly it's true. Legiunea strÃ¤inÃ¤ exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure. As it was already said the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form. Maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy he only gathers a disordered pile of events unable to follow the least story-line. The script's level is similar to a CÃ¢ntarea RomÃ¢niei amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism - only turned upside down: while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism now Daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology. The ideas content is zero and the message infantile and didactic at a kindergarten level. Unfortunately he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets. He isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation to order it in a correct movie scene to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His level of story-telling in film-images is similar to phrasing something like: Holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere and all da people is asses! What a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984 who had created unique works as Cursa Proba de microfon VÃ¢nÃ¤toarea de vulpi - and even Croaziera and Glissando ... Sic transit gloria mundi... ,neg
 The reason this is such a bad movie is because it is so very badly written and this is entirely the fault of the hack novelist Robert James Waller also author of Bridges of Madison County. The writing is bad because the plot is perfectly trite and the dialogue is wooden and implausible. A failing coupleÂ—a blocked American writer and a pretty Mexican woman with a history of which she is ashamedÂ—are swept up by a strong self-directed criminal and after a few adventures (mostly terrifically violent) alternating with scenes that show the warmer side of the assassin she leaves the impotent partner for the killer who bad as he is sees her more clearly than anyone has before. Nothing can help this movie succeed not even the seamed face of Scott Glenn as the killer not the appealing latinity of Giovanna ZacarÃ­as as Luz and not even the stalwart performance of Harvey Keitel as the CIA specialist assigned to track the killer down. A serious waste of time. ,neg
 OK first of all Steve Irwin rest in peace. You were loved by many fans. Now...this movie wasn't a movie at all. It was The Crocodile Hunter TV program with bad acting bad scripts and bad directing in between Steve capturing or teaching us about animals. He was entertaining as an animal seeker/specialist. Millions will miss him. But the whole movie idea was a big mistake. The plot was so broken it was almost non-existent. Casting was horrible. The acting wasn't even worth elementary school-level actors. The direction must be faulted as well. If you can't get a half-way decent performance out of your actors no matter how bad the script is you must not be that good in the first place. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never been to see this movie. Of course I watched it for $3 ($1.50 for me $1.50 for my son.) while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son who is not so discriminating liked the movie alright but he still has never asked to see it again. If you want fond memories of Steve Irwin buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve I know I wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie. Respect him: avoid this movie! ,neg
 Five years on from the Tenko survivors returning home and from Marion's double-edged Well that's that . It's now 1950: reunion time. The gang's all here: Marion Bea Ulrica Kate Dorothy Christina Dominica and latecomers Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is a beaut: as perfectly written and acted and as thought-provoking and moving as the original series. All the questions left hanging at the end of the series are neatly answered here. From Marion's family to Joss's health centre everything has changed in five years and not everything has changed for the best. A trip to Dominica's plantation brings plenty of shocks and some truly edge-of-the-seat tension. There's a real sense of tragedy and disaster as once again fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives. Dominica finally shows her true colours and there are some shout-at-the-telly moments of drama. Lush location filming in Singapore and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends. It's such a shame that this really is the end. I could watch it all over again. Perfection. ,pos
 A film destined to be on late-night TV long after the present instant money-makers have long been forgotten. Perhaps a little too subtle for today's youngsters but in time they'll grow into an appreciation of this movie. ,pos
 Start with the script. I have seen cartoons with more depth than Envy . Anytime characters keep repeating what you have already seen and was not funny the first time a movie is in deep trouble which Envy certainly is. A movie that relies on one joke had better have somewhere to go with it. Here we have a film that goes absolutely nowhere. Christopher Walken especially would like to forget this bomb because his character is so weak. Ben Stiller has been in some pretty good black comedies Flirting With Disaster and Duplex immediately come to mind. Be certain that Envy is not a black comedy. There are no double meanings just total nonsense. Envy deserves it's low rating because like it's subject matter it stinks. - MERK ,neg
 The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions bad puns and gunfire and to be fair there is a lot of that in it. People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films. But give it 18 years and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just being another brainless action film it works very well as a parody of reality TV. It is quite different to the Stephen King book true but I doubt whether Hollywood with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando would have accepted it in its current form. But on with the review. Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. The economy is in tatters food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch like Jumping for Dollars where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs and the most popular one is The Running Man a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'. Some however try and speak up against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield California a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labour camp but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the run. However his freedom does not last long and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him he finds himself taken prisoner again but this time he is forced to appear on The Running Man. And there of course the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers' along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence and discovers he was framed. Guess what happens to her then? So as Amber Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop. He's Super Arnie the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accent. Yes the remainder of the film becomes dumb loud classic 80's Arnie fun. There's a lot of exciting fight sequences the trademark dreadful puns ('He had to split' being my favourite) and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way as well and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings. If you expect a high-brow intelligent film you'll be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s flick well this is it. But the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic. If you look at the entertainment we have today you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV. We've already had that however with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. It seems that in the current climate at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets. With that in mind and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. Of course we haven't reached there yet as it's terrorists rather than the mainstream media who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity... ,pos
 Having seen the first ten episodes I must say this show sucks. What bothers me the most is that the show was shot in Canada. I know it's cheaper but they should have shot it in California so we could have had scenes in the desert. That would have been more true to the movie. The first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of pinetrees where it looks cold. That does'nt feel very Egyptian. What worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient Egypt. Here it feels like they're running around fighting aliens in a Canadian forrest. And it's so lame that appaerantly on other planets the fall comes as well. You can see leaves on the ground in the forrests that all look like forrests outside Vancouver. It just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb. And then there is Richard Dean Anderson. He is no Kurt Russel. Sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy Russels performance a little bit but he is just not as cool as Russel. And not nearly as good an actor as Russel. And Russells way of playing O Neill well he was much more cynical. Andersons O Neil is way too soft. I liked it that Russels version just did'nt give a s*** and had no trouble detonating the bomb until the very end of the movie. Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson though taking over from James Spader. Teal'c is a really annoying character. He is Jaffa. Not a Jaffa. Just Jaffa. Aaaarrgh!! A former bodyguard of a pathetic Ra character seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far. Teal'c speaks talks and acts like a robot. I've seen better acting from Jean Claude Van Damme. And the fact that Teal'c and the Ra character and the people they saved in the movie can speak English all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb. What made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters. As for the special effects they are really good in the pilot. But the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap. Especially a planet they visit with crystals. It's so obvious they walk around on a soundstage with a badly made painting in the background. It's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap. Especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds. The X-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993. That was 4 years before SG-1 started. And they did'nt have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode that SG-1 supposedly had. They must have spend all the money on catering. Because I don't see it on the screen. Incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had shot the show in Hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters. ,neg
 Beginning with the poster (featuring only Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey) the entire movie was a fraud. One stereotype after another this movie was about nothing - or nothing new at least. After 10-15 minutes you realize that you've just paid to see Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J recite their way through another cop-flick. Basically the story is about the corrupt system in some city all secretly supported by the backbone business and in town under the watchful eye of some hot-shot politician. The almighty and above-the-law organization is called FRAT and guess what? they've got a kick-ass loony cop shooting and beating at will - suspects girlfriends you name it. FRAT cops are corrupt and greedy so they end up making mistakes that get discovered by a young and talented (!!!) journalist. One hour later after a series of unbelievably bad-made shooting scenes and more stereotype lines everything ends happily and we get served the final line : you can't beat the system. Bah! Don't see this waste of film roll. Freeman and Spacey barely have 10 min altogether! ,neg
 Possibly the most brilliant thing about Che: Part Two as we begin to integrate it with Part One in our minds is that there is no clarification of why Che chose to confidentially abscond from Cuba after the revolution no allusion to his experience in the Congo no clarification of why he chose Bolivia as his subsequent setting for a coup d'etat no allusion to the political decisions he made as a young man motorcycling across South America which Walter Salles has given prominent familiarity. Extraordinary focus is given to Che meeting the volunteers who accompany his guerrilla factions. Yet hardly any endeavor is made to single them out as individuals to establish involved relationships. He is reasonably unreasonable. Che drives an unbreakable doctrine to leave no wounded man behind. But there is no feeling that he is deeply directly concerned with his men. It is the concept. In Part 1 in Cuba the rebels are welcomed by the people of the villages given food and cover supported in what grows to be a victorious revolution. Here in Bolivia not much understanding is apparent. Villagers expose him. They protect government troops not his own. When he expounds on the onesidedness of the government medical system his audience appears uninterested. You cannot lead a people into revolution if they do not want to comply. Soderbergh shows U.S. military advisers working with the Bolivians but doesn't fault the United States for Che's collapse. Che seems to have just misfigured his fight and the place where he wanted to have it. In showcasing both wars Soderbergh doesn't build his battle scenes as actions with specific results. Che's men attack and are attacked. They exchange fire with faraway assailants. There is generally a cut to the group in the aftershock of combat its death toll not paused for. This is not a war movie. It is about one man's reasonably unreasonable drive to endure. There is no elaborate cinematography. Soderbergh looks firmly at Che's inflexible dedication. There are remarkable sporadic visceral shots but being few they are all the more powerful such as Che's POV shot during his final beats. There is an abundance of the terrain where these men live for weeks at a time and the all-consuming effect is of languor Guevara himself having malaria part of the time. Benicio Del Toro one of the film's producers gives a champion's performance not least because it's modest. He isn't portrayed as the cutting edge like most epic heroes. In Cuba he arises in conquest in Bolivia he falls to the reverse and occasionally is actually difficult to distinguish behind a tangle of beard and hair. Del Toro illustrates not so much an identity as an attitude. You may think the film is too long. I think there's a genuine cause for its breadth. Guevara's affairs in Cuba and particularly Bolivia was not a sequence of episodes and sketches but an undertaking of staying power that might virtually be called insane. In the end Che as a whole or in parts is a commercially ballsy movie one where its director begins by understanding the limits innate in cinematic biography and working progressively within those means. ,pos

 I love Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role. The movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some Monastery working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial-arts-like discipline. The acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed-to-be Thailand is eye-catching but Claire Daines steals the entire movie and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world. The flaws are minute and I recommend the film which seems buried sadly forever to rare TV showings. I for one want the film for my collection- a collection of only 10 rated films. Watch it you will be very touched. ,pos
 I attempted to watch this film without being able to really sit through it for while it is suppose to have a good message; the problem is that it is obviously produced according to one particular interpretation of scripture. An interpretation in my opinion will mislead a lot of people. In addition I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely unacceptable. Never before had I wished for a negative score to rate a movie. So if you wish to be preached to incessantly by those without authority then by all means get this film. This comment is also a warning to people who like or love scifi because the title will deceive a lot of people as well. This was an unfortunate film because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were squandered. The film's only redeemable quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the Time Machine probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future. ,neg
 The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while F. Murray Abraham was in it. Spoilers: About halfway through F.Murray gets zapped because The Darkling is some kind of demon-like creature who enjoys living vicariously. He takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success. He feeds from their enjoyment of the Seven Deadly Sins. However part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil. Otherwise he cannot pervert their natural goodness. That's what the little guy said in his Barry White voice which I found both charming and amusing. Mostly amusing. Like imagine Barry White if he were a little dwarf and he was telling Aiden Gillen Dee Plane Dee Plane Bos Here eet come Dee Plane! All through the movie Dee Dwarf (actually a robotronic cherub) talks to Aiden Gillen in the Barry White voice saying things like It's OK to be bad you know you want it. Now you've committed murder you're really moving up in the world and other remarks that sound like commercials for Being Evil Stores or something. It really is hilarious in a sick way. Anyhow Aiden Gillen is no F. Murray Abraham and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the axe (or knifed?). F. Murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film. He is a good actor. Aiden Gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face and he looks like maybe his remedial English Comp. class had never hit the Mythological Characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about. The ENDING is really creepy and yet almost comical. If this movie were a parody the ending was perfect. If it was not a parody then it was creepy; but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross-out that the movie itself could not deliver. The people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending. It just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending. ,neg
 and it did. It is through my experience that when a horror film reaches franchise status and subsequent titles are released thereafter they all in turn become stricken by one inevitable factor: irrelevance. Omen IV: The Awakening makes no exception to this rule featuring another small child supposedly embracing their role as the Anti-Christ foretold by a religious prophecy. Haven't we seen this before? Wasn't it enough that over the span of three films prior to this release we've experienced the rise and fall of Damien Thorn? If you're a horror enthusiast such as myself you'll realize that it's common for a horror movie that has many sequels and prequels to its credit to fade away into redundancy - Children of the Corn Hellraiser Phantasm; the list goes on. At this point in the game I'm sure you know what to expect when you're prepared to view the fourth title in a series. Regardless there are times when you sit back and realize how shameless some filmmakers are. Omen IV: The Awakening is just that too - a shameless money making exercise. This film does not offer anything new or intriguing to the Omen lineup. As unique and genuine as Omen IV tries to be compared to its siblings the similarities and plot devices are embarrassingly alike. Elements like the guardian dog the involvement of a priest the skepticism of the people involved the decapitation death scene (clearly a homage to the original film when the journalist is beheaded by the sheet of glass)...even right down to the father's involvement in politics and prestige within the community make it too predictable. Although it is common to star a B-Rated cast into a horror title this far into a series the acting is off the charts chock-full of ridiculousness and unintentional humor due to some of the poorly delivered lines throughout this film. The atmosphere has completely vanished in comparison to the first three titles. In addition the epic score composed by Goldsmith in the previous movies has been replaced by an auditory debacle; an absolute joke and made me wonder if it was actually intended to be used for this film or just pulled from a bank of stock audio...which really says something because rarely do I comment on the lousy misuse of a musical score - until now. All in all I'd call Omen IV: The Awakening a failure. In the world of horror movies that carry a long list of titles behind them some manage to hit the mark and some don't. If you're interested in creating another notch on your weathered horror belt such as I am for completion purposes perhaps you could carve this title into it as well - if not for entertainment value then to appreciate when a film is executed properly or poorly. ,neg
 The Good Earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The movie is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is laughable as the farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent as do most of the lead actors that I could not bear listening to him speak. It is a shame that Hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead roles. To take Anglos and make them look like Chinese is akin to Anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play African-Americans. ,neg
 Thankfully as a student I have been able to watch Diagnosis Murder for a number of years now. It is basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his LAPD son a young doctor and a pathologist. DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing. The main cast gave good performances and Dick Van Dyke's entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic dance and humor. The best aspects of DM was the fast pace witty scripts and of course the toe tapping score. Sadly it has been unfairly compared to Murder She Wrote . DM is far superior boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety. Now it is gone TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of feelgood family friendly cop shows. Now there is just depressing 'gritty' ones. ,pos
 What can be said really... The Tenant is a first-class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia. It's an intricately-plotted film--every detail seems included for a reason--even though the plot seldom makes sense and much of it is never even addressed in an objective manner. Therefore we are left with the increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski)--a meek Polish man who has obtained an apartment due to the previous tenant's suicide--to guide us through a world of escalating fear and uncertainty. After an apartment-warming party thrown by a group of obnoxious coworkers Trelkovsky comes under increased seemingly inexplicable scrutiny by the fellow occupants in his building; the rest of the film chronicles his mental deterioration and gives us a thorough mindfu*k on par with the later efforts of David Lynch. The Tenant however is more brooding and sinister laced with unexpected comic relief fine performances and a truly haunting score. It's a movie that's better experienced than described so hop to it. ,pos
 I'll try to use words to describe this on.... I saw the original which was good in its own way but back then I should have feared a sequel. And I was 'afraid' when I picked this one up but now that I've seen it I have to say it's even worse then I thought. Why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin. Let's start with the actors;they aren't all that good but it has to be said some make heads turn by being just plain awful. But what can an actor do with a script like this one. It's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn't been done before fails miserably. In a futile attempt to get it up-to-date they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole 'big-brother' theme but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the '83 original but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad. In conclusion if you have nothing and I mean nothing to do... go watch it or play Frisbee... with the DVD.... by yourself. It'll offer you the same amount of fun.. I promise ,neg
 Just watched the film for the 3rd time and enjoyed Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast just as much as before. It just keeps getting better and better. You simply have to marvel at the carefully measured way of speech the slow deliberate action everything being exactly in place. Truly one of the great ones and definitely my all-time favourite!!! ,pos
 First of all I'd like to tell you that I'm into comics anime animation and such stuff. It is true that everyone has his own preferences but you can trust me on this movie. I'll be objective. To begin with the story - it's OK. Follows the story line of the comic books as far as I'm familiar with them. But the animation... Well it's not actually terrible but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be a lot better if they didn't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings. If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more. Looks a little bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for instance - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better! In addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable the music is nothing special. So all in all - it lacks atmosphere. I watched it but I cannot tell I really enjoyed it. It just does not capture you. There's plenty of blood and violence but that does not impress me at all. May be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?) but I don't think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add a little nudity and spice to it. The chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty and hell we have Lady Death herself! There are few sexy looks but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all - the movie isn't that bad but if you want something better take the original Heavy Metal Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards maybe. And of course - Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust ,neg
 Another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the Holocaust is turned face up in this docudrama about the Rosenstrasse Protest in Berlin an event I had not known of that began in late February 1943. The details are given in an addendum that follows this review. The film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in New York City in the present. Here a well off non-observant Jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by insisting on an extremely orthodox mourning ritual. She goes even further demanding that her daughter's non-Jewish fiancÃ© leave the house. The distressed daughter Hannah (Maria Schrader) then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during WWII in Berlin her mother then 8 years old had been taken in and protected by an Aryan woman. Hannah drops everything goes to Berlin and finds this woman Lena Fischer now 90. Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story. It all seems rather too pat. The film thereafter improves focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest in which the fictitious central character is the same Mrs. Fischer at 33 (played magnificently by Katja Riemann) a Baroness and accomplished pianist who is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel) a Jewish concert violinist one of the men detained at the Rosenstrasse site. The narrative does briefly weave back to the present from time to time and also ends in New York City once again. While scenes in the present are color saturated the 1943 scenes are washed out strong on blue-gray tones. The quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep reservoir of talent in Germany and the direction of Margarethe von Trotta New German Cinema's most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress. The story of the protest is told simply. Only one feature is lacking that would have helped: still-text notes at the end indicating the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at Rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the addendum below makes clear incredibly positive. Rosenstrasse has not fared well in the opinions of most film critics. Overly long needlessly layered purveyor of gender stereotypes manipulative with music: so go the usual raps. It is too long. But I found in this film an austere powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the vigil outside the place on Rosenstrasse where their Jewish relatives and others were detained. I found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction. The very absence of extreme violence (no one is shot or otherwise physically brutalized) intensified my tension which increased incrementally as the film progressed. You keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute. The somberness of the film stayed with me afterward. I awoke often later in the night I saw the film my mind filled with bleak melancholic chaotic images and feelings conjured by the film. For me that happens rarely. (In German and English). My rating: 8/10 (B+). (Seen on 05/31/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my websites. Add: The Rosenstrasse Protest: Swept up from their forced labor jobs in what was meant to be the Final Roundup in the national capital 1700 to 2000 Jews mostly men married to non-Jewish women were herded into Rosenstrasse 2-4 a welfare office for the Jewish community in central Berlin. Because these Jews had German relatives many of them highly connected Adolf Eichmann hoped that segregating them from other prisoners would convince family members that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied Poland. Normally those arrested remained in custody for only two days before being loaded onto trains bound for the East. But before deportation of prisoners could occur in this case wives and other relatives got wind of what was happening and appeared at the Rosenstrasse address first in ones and twos and then in ever-growing numbers. Perhaps as many as six thousand participated in the protest although not all at the same time. Women demanded back their husbands day after day for a week. Unarmed unorganized and leaderless they faced down the most brutal forces at the disposal of the Third Reich. Joseph Goebbels the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin anxious to have that city racially cleansed was also in charge of the nation's public morale. On both counts he was worried about the possible repercussions of the women's actions. Rather than inviting more open dissent by shooting the women down in the streets and fearful of jeopardizing the secrecy of the Final Solution Goebbels with Hitler's concurrence released the Rosenstrasse prisoners and even ordered the return of twenty-five of them who already had been sent to Auschwitz! To both Hitler and Goebbels the decision was a mere postponement of the inevitable. But they were mistaken. Almost all of those released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. The women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction. (Adapted from an article posted at the University of South Florida website A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust. ) ,pos
 Spoilers! From the very moment I saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10:00 news I wanted to see it. I don't remember who it was or which local Omaha newscast carried the review but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church-going Nebraskan. They showed a snippet from the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Ann-Margret when she's swimming in the pool. Glover's character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out. I was hooked. There was one problem though. I was only 13 years old at the time and I had to wait a year until it came out on cable. Let's just say it was worth the wait! If ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine this movie is it. To call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement. The film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider who is as effective as ever plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time. He's sleazy funny at times and always on the brink of doing something crazy. Then there's Robert Trebor's (nice name by the way!) character Leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme. He is a whimpering sweating coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason. Who could forget the wake-up call he gives Vanity with the giant teddy bear? After dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he's up against Scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation that is until Glover goes after his wife! The conflict is played out brutally with virtually the entire cast getting shot raped or blown up. I don't know why I love this movie so much. It really should creep me out but it doesn't. Maybe it's because these characters are all interesting and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try. It's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like Glover's running around out in L.A. looking for trouble. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle. Hey sport have a nice day! This film has plenty of shootouts cool cars great dialog (like the line in my opening statement) and decent acting. Plenty of cameos by real life porno stars. Look for Ron Jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at Glover's place. Another thing I must add: How hot are the women in this film??? Wow! Travolta did right by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see Vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential American Beauty. 9 of 10 stars. So sayeth the Hound. Added Feb 14 2008: RIP Roy Scheider! ,pos
 A yawn-inducing snail-paced disappointment Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money. When a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender Â– his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with secrets and intents of her own sent to recover an item from the bank owner's safety deposit box that is stored within the bank and you have quite the three-way dilemma. Unfortunately all you get it set-up in the film and nothing pays off in the end. Denzel Washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance. The only saving grace for the film is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen who are much better than the film itself. In fact Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high-caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless cutthroat villain of sorts. Clive Owen isn't given much to do besides brood and pose but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role. It's strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while he was creating this film. The most perplexing aspect of Inside Man however is how much unwarranted praise it has received. For a film that seemed to have all the makings of a pre-summer blockbuster this one falls horribly flat. ,neg
 I saw this movie today at the Haifa Film Festival in Israel after hearing rave reviews but I guess the critics were just sucking up to Willem Defoe and his wife (the director) who were present at the festival. It is definitely the slowest movie I have ever seen with numerous pointless ridiculously long scenes of nothing. Besides Defoe who was decent the acting of the two and a half other people in the movie Defoe's wife Giada included was ridiculously awful (how they cast the part of the salesgirl at the bakery is beyond me). This movie is pretty much plot less with a lame attempt to be abstract and off the wall. The only scene that stirred any kind of reaction in the crowd was vulgar and came from nowhere as if just to add some kind of shock value to the dullness that is this movie. Sorry for being so harsh but really this movie is a precious waste of time and money. I appreciate good indie cinema but this movie is not worthy of moviegoers' time. ,neg
 I was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget movie. The most glaring absurdity was that while the American inmates in a North Korean POW camp are all supposedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine going without bathing shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas and sleeping on bare floors and - let's not forget enduring torture - they always manage to sport impeccably coiffed hair. With the exception of a suitably austere-looking Harry Morgan as an army Major the casting and acting are simply awful. Ronald Regan cannot seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. A mostly Caucasian cast portraying the North Korean camp officers might have been forgivable but when supposedly Russian officers acting as advisors to the Koreans strut around wearing re-badged Nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots (obvious costume-department recycles from WWII flicks) and speaking with accents like General Burkhalter from Hogan's Heroes well that's just six kinds of silly. Don't waste your time on this one. ,neg
 What the ........... is this ? This must without a doubt be the biggest waste of film settings and camera ever. I know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high but this is too stupid to be true. I baught this film for 0.89$ and I still feel the urge to go claim my money back. Can you imagine who hard it STINKS ? Who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations??? Well actually you couldn't possible care less. And why should you? The makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care. They didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension. The director ( Stephen Carpenter -- I guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the Kindred (1986) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did Soul Survivors. Complete crap as well but at least that one had Eliza Dushku. This junk has the debut of Daphne Zuniga !!! ( Who ?? ) Yeah that's right the Melrose Place chick. Her very memorable character dies about 15 min. after the opening credits. She's the second person to die. The first victim dies directly in the first minute but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ? The rest of the actors...they don't deserve the term actors actually are completely uninteresting. You're hoping they die a quick and painful death...and not only their characters My humble opinion = 0 / 10 ,neg
 It's one of the best movies I've seen in the last 2 years (I've seen the premier in Tel-Aviv Israel in the summer of 2006 exactly when the last war has began...) This problem in communication between the people that causes wars is interesting me for a long time and it doesn't matter who- boys and girls straight and gays Jews and Arabs... I've seen the Bubble already 3 times and it still surprising and exciting me- each character reminds me of one of the many people i know and the difference between them like between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem... The last time i saw it- was with my friend who is a Christian Arab and it was on the independence day of Israel ( the most symbolic i could ! how ironic) and... he cried in the end!!! - if he's been touched and wasn't embarrassed- everyone would be touched by The Bubble! ,pos
 Before I go on I have to admit to being a huge Bon Jovi fan. In fact thats what attracted me to the DVD case in the first place. I probably would have bought it anyway being such a big horror fan and having enjoyed the first Vampires title so much. But this isn't half as good. Not even Jon could save this film for me. My main problem would be that it simply isn't scary. Apart from Jon's character Derek Bliss none of the other characters make an impression and you couldn't care less whether they die or not especially the annoying vampire / drug addict woman. The female vampire simply isn't scary or sexy. Rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl no wonder she is so desperate for blood then. Another huge problem is that everything is just too bright . There is no atmosphere or sense of dread. I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be. This film has no tension like that. The story is basically the same as before. Vampire wants Berzier's cross to be able to walk in daylight. However the story has less cool bits this time. There is no wow factor in knowing this is the master of all master - the original vampire as in the first film. You really don't care who or what this one is. There is no army of masters. Instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a Disneyland attraction then a creepy temple. So there you have it really. Lack of scares lack of atmosphere lack of interesting story. A real let down for me personally. ,neg
 Maybe the movie itself isn't one of the best Jackie Chan's movies but I think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made. There also was some memorable stunts which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic. This movie influenced many other action movies and I think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film (like they could remake that chase scene I thing with modern technologies they could make it even better). There also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when Jackie wasn't fighting. Althou I think they could put more fighting scenes in this film. ,pos
 The selection of Sylvester Stallone to perform the protagonist by Renny Harlin is commendable since Stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But to compare Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far-fetched notion. The excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws. The heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before. The biting cold of the snow capped Alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation. The forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end. Good movies are not made every year and people don't get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then. Apart from the filthy language/parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years. ,pos
 Does anyone know the exact quote about time and love by George Ede aka Father Fitzpatrick in the move It had to be you? He was talking to Charlie and Annna in the church as they were leaving? If not I will have to rent the movie. This was a great movie. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! I met my one true love (my Soulmate) and although I had the experience to meet him when I had least expecting it I wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship. Altho we did marry I wasn't mature enough to give as much as I thought I would. I got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years. He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry & in disbelief about the way it turned out. I had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years. This movie meant a lot because I am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love. I can NOW appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick rang true for me. I know when he has healed enough to trust me again we will remarry. Don't EVER GET COMPLACENT AND TAKE TRUE LOVE FOR GRANTED! IT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE. Also the music in this movie is OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL! This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for if it is meant to be it will no matter what IT WILL HAPPEN! Nothing is impossible even when it's the second time around! Thanks! ,pos
 The only reason I didn't score this a one is that Sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film. It is a technically adept film. That having been said this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven. Most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact. And Sibrel's irrefutable proof that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics. I do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at google video for free. Don't let Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity. ,neg
 I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made ...and simply is. It's one-and-a-half hour of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls). Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way which is basically fine since it's a horror-movie. And I (usually) like horror-movies. I've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. It's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque. It's so lame it even gets boring and really quick too. The worst thing (if the above wasn't bad enough for ya) about this movie is that they've tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras. But (again this too) serves no end whatsoever. In the Blair Which sure enough there's an explanation namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this film there's no other explanation than: Hey ya'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch!! The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying. Also no effort has been made to make anything any better sound-wise or other wise. Than finally there's the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock... My advise: Don't watch this under ANY circumstances. ,neg
 The film had many fundamental values of family and love. It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story. The script was clear( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children)and was enjoyable and humorous at times. There were a few charged symbols to look for. The cinematography was acceptable. There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today(which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out). It was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it. Although editing could have been done better I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy. And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I didn't like either but in all it was a good movie. ,pos
 A young basketball-playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence using human fetuses. He hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He's pressured into concluding his research because he hasn't published so the university is having trouble justifying funding him (I think). He does a trial injection on a monkey which quickly dies. He then tries it on himself. He starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy; she's the one who had been demanding results from the research. Initially he seems to have no effects from the injection except some new strength. He then realizes that he had some memory loss and starts recalling what happened. Additionally he starts to appear very unhealthy. Since the movie is named metamorphosis he does eventually change into something else. You won't believe your eyes - either what he turned into or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he's turned into. Incredibly there's a further change in store - the end of the movie is really really absurd. About the only thing this movie has going for it is that Laura Gemser is in it but she has a very small part. I'd once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover. Possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time perhaps eyes that light up (the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie). The copy I watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic which had been removed. The novelty boxcover if it still had it would have been the only reason I would have held onto this movie; I'm definitely getting rid of it. ,neg
 Wow here it finally is; the action movie without action. In a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future Seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood. There is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies mainly Matrix without having the money to do it right. Yes we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then. And yes we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes. Believe me it is as bad as it possibly can get. In fact it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously but perhaps I can make some of you not rent it and save your money. ,neg
 Watching film i was in very light mood and also this film is light but the end of the film is just unexpected which leaves a long lasting memories in one's mind. movie starts with Abhay and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage. Soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesn't leaving Soha alone on to the street she cant go back home and she don't have any thing to live on here in this situation Abahy turns out to be a helper for her this is the base of story. The rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that Abhay has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seat. Dialogues and music are good songs are OK direction is good and so as the screenplay you do feel that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story it is all right. A truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts. my rating for this is 8/10 ,pos
 After reading several comments I felt I had to add in my two cents as well. Sorrow Lost is one of the most memorable shorts I think I have ever seen. I had gotten the chance to see this at the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt that this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was beautifully complex - especially for such a short amount of time. The story is focused on a young girl who is victimized by her abusive father. She is soon given the choice to stop him by a demon played by Witchblade's Eric Etebari. Having watched the show I was amazingly impressed with how he played such unique and different character. I never knew he could act so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive. The acting was absolutely superb by him. The girl's was okay and the father's was decent. There is also death in this who follows the girl around until she is able to escape from her future. The effects and cinematography were absolutely mind blowing. I wonder if they had at least a hundred thousand budget for this. It is rare you get to see such a high quality short. The opening was absolutely breathtaking comparable with any major feature film. This isn't to say that it's not without its flaws - I thought it took a little to get going and the intro was a little long. But this stuck in my head days after watching it. There are very few shorts with this level of quality. ,pos
 When I was at the movie store the other day I passed up Blonde and Blonder but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean I'm sure most people bashed Romy and Michelle before they saw it Blonde and Blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up. But when I started watching it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson wow I knew I was in for something scary. Not only that but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards not to offend them but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that I think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20's not their 40's. The story was just plain bad and obnoxious. Dee and Dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their ignorance is bliss attitudes. They are set up to make a hit on a guy and they think they're just going to show him a good time but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls. Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy but it was more than stupid it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary. Would I ever recommend this? Not in a million years the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as sex kittens it's more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell. 1/10 ,neg
 First of all this was not a three hour movie - Two hours ten minutes... last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie! Perhaps though it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? Yeah would have gotten more in been able to explore some more emotion. Overall though it was an interesting look into the lives of Lucy and Desi. I watch I Love Lucy from time to time and love it but never have I read or seen a biography never knew anything about their lives off the screen. Because of this movie I do now but I'm not so sure that's a good thing. Everything here no one really needed to know. This was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made. But it was made and the reason is because Lucy & Desi are still such huge stars and certain people in American society feel that the rest of society needs to know ALL about our tv and movie stars. That is definitely so not true and very very sad. Anyway what was shown here in Lucy was pretty good. Two complaints - the actress who played Viv Vance - not great casting at all. And the switch from Madeline Zima to Rachel York.... uhhh like Lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? That wasn't too great. But the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between Lucy & Desi. No the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like I said this focused mainly just on Lucy & Desi. Had there been more time had the story been more about Lucy's entire life then maybe the kids woulda been there more. But they weren't so we got to see the likes of Gable & Lombard Red Skelton and Buster Keaton very briefly instead. Wow that was one thing about this story that I thought was really cool: his presence and influence in Lucy's life. Really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more. Oh well. What was explored was done well for the most part. Honestly I don't think I'll ever watch this again and I don't think this movie'll be that memorable. For someone who digs I Love Lucy but isn't an enormous Lucille Ball fan this should be an interesting watch. My grade for this: B ,pos
 I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio-bound the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location. But no problem - it's still a much underrated lovely composition from Marcel Carne. The plot seems a bit choppy at times as if they were making it up as they went along but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue but it's all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-War France or simply idiots? Suicide pacts are fairly common; if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools? Arletty played the part of prostitute well - she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway! I've only seen a few films with Jouvet - he is the most impressive invention as pimp in HDN - my trouble is shallow: every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! A remarkably atmospheric well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man. All in all: wonderful. ,pos
 I sat through this movie this evening forcing myself to stick with it even though I never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because the two leads GÃ©rard Philippe and MichÃ¨le Morgan were major film stars of their era and I wanted to see them in something different which this certainly was. They both gave fine performances but of distasteful characters. Indeed the whole movie is about a shabby little town in Mexico inhabited by almost uniformly distasteful characters (the doctor is of course the major exception). What MichÃ¨le Morgan ever sees in Philippe to fall in love with him is never explained. This is supposedly based on a work by Jean-Paul Sartre. All I could think was that if Sartre's work is anything like this movie it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating Camus' masterful novel The Plague which dealt with a plague in North Africa. A well-acted but uninteresting movie. ,neg
 I watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago I still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity. The first few scenes alone were hilarious. I won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it I wouldn't want to ruin the laughs. Needless to say the entire time I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing. Towards the end we all got bored however as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off. There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting. The characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten Learn to Read book. They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting. ,neg
 I thought The River of Souls was a very good Babylon 5 movie with some exceptional performances from Martin Sheen Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If this were an episode of the series (without the humour) it would probably be one of my favourite stand-alone stories of the series. Personally I've always preferred Scoggins to Christian although granted JMS didn't write her as well for much of the series and she did have to endure the Byron/Telepath plot. If you take out the smutty humour about the brothel and the poorer actors in those scenes then this movie is solid stuff. Probably my third favourite of the four movies but in no means bad at all. ,pos
 This can't be Mandy Schaffer's last film. Somebody do something! :-( Argh. What little life this one might have had the directing finished off. Don't blame the cast; they did OK. Even the winemaker's younger brother was pretty well done and he didn't even get into the movie until halfway through. And please please put Mandy in some more movies! She's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age. Ya' breakin' my haht heah.... Two specific criticisms in case anyone cares (apparently nobody liked this movie very much). First the way Traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment in order to see whatever she was supposed to see and never got seen in return was very annoying. Hollywood: please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives. It's dumb. Write better scripts so you won't have to use that lame plot device any more. If your script isn't good enough to stand up without that then don't produce it. Second Carmen wouldn't have fallen for that fake injury trick that Traci pulled. She already had Traci fingered. More bad writing/directing there. I could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it. Actually I didn't hate it as much as the others seem to have. It just didn't have much of a reason for being made unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely Mandy. Oh and to whoever didn't think she was sexy... the character wasn't very well written but how can you say she wasn't sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses and I don't think it's me. MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with Moore Mandy -- although I'd like to see her again too. ;-) P.S. Did I mention I hope Mandy makes me more movies? <:-D ,neg
 This is a fantastic series first and foremost. It is very well done and very interesting. As a huge WWII buff I had learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds comparatively speaking that is. It is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. One of the best parts is the narrating by Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about WWII but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. My only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. Especially with the information about Soviet Union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. That information is now different we now know because of the fall of the USSR. Overall a fascinating look at WWII and a must see for any serious WWII historian professional or personal alike. ,pos
 Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was one very fortunate lady many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money. Her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds. Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children. They dressed in clothes and had many amenities. One day she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla. Knowing nothing about the large apes she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life. Once out of danger Trudy decides she will raise the gorilla also as one of her children. This works well for years and Buddy the gorilla is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home. But Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous. Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control? For those who love animals Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story Trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore. Of course Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one in the film but he is very close to seeming totally real. Russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice. The costumes are exemplary as befitting the earlier era of the story and the settings and production values outstanding. But most importantly animals are here in abundance not only Buddy but the adorable chimps the ducks the rabbits and so forth. For those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven here on earth this is a great movie choice. All animal lovers and even those who just want to watch a great family film will go ape over Buddy. ,pos
 as an actor I really like independent films but this one is amateur at best. The boys go to Vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes - palms no. And the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees. When the boys are leaving VT they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is Federal Express. Did they ship themselves Overnight in a crate? Come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur. The Christian brother is far gayer than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo. The two should have switched roles. The minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible. Applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time ,neg
 This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In reality perhaps they are. After all the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon does a very credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film somebody is trying to kill him. There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real. There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences add realism to the film in feeling. The suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series. ,pos
 Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or does every movie that starts in Roswell New Mexico suck. Take Alien mixed with The Thing mixed with Contact mixed with of all things On the Beach The Andromeda Strain the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to boot. Derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie. Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease. (James Spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable Leslie Stefanson asks to join himÂ…. he turns her down. AGGH!) In fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it. I mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for broke. With about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichÃ©d artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif. (Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logan's Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them. That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. The acting is mostly fine as Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear. John Lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it. Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper Children of The Corn in Space movie. ,neg
 Harsh yes but I call 'em like I see 'em. I saw this in the late 80's and it was truly one of the most awful boring films I've ever forced myself to watch. Yes the cinematography is lovely. The Czech settings are truly stunning. The political backdrop is enticing but unlike similar historically set stories (e.g. _Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)) this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story or even interesting. Sure Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film manages to make even erotic scenes plodding and slow. I'm all for romance but this movie was so boring I started hoping the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery. I'm sure if I'd read the book the story would have made a bit more sense. However life's too short to expend any more time on this one. ,neg
 I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then I'm pretty forgiving of movies. Although I tried I just could not stand this movie at all it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on. Although I know it's suppose to be a comedy but I didn't find it very funny. It was also an especially unrealistic and jaded portrayal of rural life. In case this is what any of you think country life is like it's definitely not. I do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute but the french guy was really fake. I do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it it's just too annoying. ,neg
 Two years ago I watched The Matador in cinema and I loved everything about this movie. Obviously I was totally under impression of Pierce Brosan's magnificent role. Yesterday I caught this movie again on TV so I looked at it a bit deeper. Now I can say with certain that this movie isn't that special but you just gotta' love it because of one man. Brosnan lifts its grade up in my opinion with amazing performance of Julian Noble tired hit-man who has no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico City man who's got bad luck: his son died in accident his job isn't going that well and he's not sure that he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis). I always liked movies like this; crime movie with big touch of humor. Mostly that humor comes from Brosnan as he tells jokes about dwarfs with big d.... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning after the navy's left town. Brosnan says it with his charm while he's drinking his margarita as usually. I also like Greg 'typical American face' Kinnear in the role of loser that is very lively made because there are plenty of people like Danny Wright. So I recommend you to watch quite possibly the best role of Brosnan ever. He'll make you smile and admire him at the same time. Great Brosnan in not equally great movie. ,pos
 I'm a bit conflicted over this. The show is on one hand awful the acting is terrible (even when we get actual name actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in one episode) the dialogue is moronic and the premise/moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short. There's no way you'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes and Robert Englund's cameos are short pointless and corny in a sort of a Bob Saget on America's Funniest Home Videos kind of way. On the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television. The 80s fashions the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of The View at all times the premises lend the material more to self-parody than scares so we're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his SAT's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him another is afraid she'll be locked up in prison because she's a substandard mom (her husband is played by Brad Pit) another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home another is afraid she'll be confused with her socially-retarded twin another is afraid if he doesn't break up his mom and step-dad he'll get killed for having a party at his house. The list goes on and on. Being that these are dreams I suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices but they're so out of left field that there's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience. You have characters dressed like something out of a 80s-themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point (typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it). If you're looking for something that'll scare you stay away. If you're looking on the other hand for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever. Watch it. Its been showing on Chiller TV lately (pretty much every day) and I've been watching earlier out of morbid curiosity and now just so I can get a good laugh in each day. With Arrested Development and Extras off the air this is officially the funniest thing on television right now. ,pos
 Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: A Red Scare movie devoid of hysteria in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves loose woman Jean Peters of her wallet containing a strip of microfilm; unbeknownst to either of them it harbors secrets vital to the Cold War. Peters as it happens was under surveillance by FBI agents who are as nonplussed by the theft as the man who's running her cowardly comsymp Richard Kiley. In trying to retrieve the precious film both sides enlist the help of Thelma Ritter a streetwise old jane who's always on the earie and willing to sell what she hears. Fuller draws from an opulent palette of tempos and tonalities in telling the story which becomes a race against the clock of escalating brutality. From the subways to the waterfront his midsummer Manhattan takes on a sweaty sheen that's almost pungent. The love scenes between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mixture of the tumultuous and the tender and they're scored to Again a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House also starring Widmark. The pace slackens for Ritter's beautifully written and played death scene -- among the most poignant vignettes in all noir and a kind of mirage-oasis in a film parched of sentimentality. This is writer/director Fuller's only work in the strictest confines of the noir cycle; his later explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono The Naked Kiss Underworld U.S.A.) never resulted in a synthesis as satisfying as Pickup on South Street. ,pos
 Hooper is Not Funny Not Fasted paced Not romantic and Non informative. There is no real drama. You would think that a movie about the world's greatest stuntman would have some drama there was an attempt but it didn't seem real. No Character study no lessons learned it did not even look like the actors were having any real fun they were just trying to act like they were having fun. There is no reason to watch unless you like to look at Burt and want get an occasional glimpse of Sally. Prancer the horse was beautiful and did what he was supposed to do. In fact Prancer was the best actor in this movie. Smoky and the Bandit was such a fun movie that I was ready to like Hooper. This movie turned out to be a real disappointment and waste of time ,neg
 (this may be a bit on the spoilerish side) I would like to start by saying I did not watch the entire movie nor could I because it was evident from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed. That of course is the problem with taking what many believe to be an amazing book and turning it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie. A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago. It's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults. Plus it's got built in quality sequels. But Disney-fying was not the way to go. The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book. It is a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely psychic because that was the easiest way of explaining it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W's as added tension there is enough tension in the story without that. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses... that deprived us of what could've been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book. I could nitpick for days about little things but I also think larger things like the art direction was a off. Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look with its strangely darkened skies. The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth. It looks like earth. It has people on it that look like humans. The skies are blue the grass is green and there are children playing. But something is a little bit off. The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie. The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth that is if we forget how to love. It would've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm. I unfortunately did not watch the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end as well. Overall an artistic disappointment. ,neg
 First of all Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie and she's just awful. This movie has every horror move clichÃ© in imagination and all badly played. The over-sexed teen couple. The comical(not)horny jock. The snotty cool chick. The creepy local color guy. The parental-type couple. The virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films. The dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool. It's almost like you're wishing that they'd all die sooner. I saw the rough cut of this film a while ago but somehow this just got worse. Sure the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog. Avoid at all costs. ,neg
 I'm a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind. That being said I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I've seen in some time. To have a good movie you need to have a well-written screenplay. Left Behind fell woefully short on this. For one thing it radically deviates from the book. Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour film but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever. Another thing there is zero character development. When characters in the story get saved (I won't say who) the book makes it clear that it's a long soul-searching process. In the film it's quick and artificial. The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial. In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind (again I won't say who) it seems artificial. I realize as a Christian it's unedifying for me to say I disliked this film but I can't in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done. Perhaps it would've been better to make the first book into 2-3 films. Either way Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way. I realize a lot of effort probably went into Left Behind but that's the way I see it. ,neg
 I saw this film on True Movies (which automatically made me sceptical) but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue (of which there is little) but because actually despite what people say I thought the film was accurate in it's depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy. It's NOT Dawson's Creek they're not graceful cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge. They're kids and they act like kids would. They're blunt awkward and annoyingly confused about everything. Yes this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but I don't think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (when not trying to be cool) a very believable performance and I loved him for it. Patricia Arquette IS whiny and annoying but she was pregnant and a teenagers? The combination of the two isn't exactly lavender on your pillow. The plot was VERY predictable and but so what? I believed them his stress and inability to cope - her brave yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together. I think the characters acted by anyone else WOULD indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they weren't. It reflects the surreality of the situation they're in that he's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby. I felt angry at her for that I felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her. I felt it all. In the end I loved it and would recommend it. Watch out for the scene where Dermot Mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session - career performance. ,pos
 I wish that '70s show would come back on television. It was the greatest show ever!!! They should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing. But I wish it would come back and make more episodes. Please come back... The show was absolutely hilarious. You couldn't laugh without seeing an episode. There is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when Hyde and Jackie were going out with each other. Those were the best episodes. That '70s show is the best .... It will be and always will be the best show ever. It was really sad when the show ended. They should make new episodes. ,pos
 Viewing DE VIERDE MAN (aka THE FOURTH MAN) is a slightly unsettling and rather fascinating experience. It's a very tight and intense psychological mystery/thriller from Netherlands's Paul Verhoeven. He directed this film just before he got big with his free-ticket to Hollywood -movie FLESH + BLOOD. In a lot of user-comments on this site I noticed the mentioning of Alfred Hitchcock. Indeed this movie might very well be Hitchcockian but I also noticed touches of early Cronenberg (the visceral) flavors of David Lynch (surreal story-linked visuals) and even Roman Polanski (plot-wise set-up). Funny thing is that the movies by those directors I was thinking of while watching DE VIERDE MAN weren't made until after 1983 the year of release of THE FOURTH MAN. So go figure. Very much credit indeed must be given to the story of the original novel by Gerard Reve this movie is based on. Gerard Reve is also the fictional name of the main character (a tormented writer played by Jeroen KrabbÃ© balancing on the dangerous line of a severe psychosis). Now has anybody stopped and thought about the fact that the word rÃªve is French for dream ? And the film does feature a lot of dream-like/nightmarish sequences often to that extend that you don't always know for sure if Gerard is awake or dreaming himself. Could this be coincidence...? Maybe it's just me but I don't think so. RenÃ©e Soutendijk is pretty amazing as the leading lady (in a rather demanding role). She sometimes seems to be guilty of over-acting (in a subtle way). But that aspect was clearly intentional to portray the character she plays since as this movie progresses you become unsure about what to actually think of this lady and her intentions. Proves again what an excellent actress she is. I might add that the movie contains also several scenes portraying full frontal male & female nudity as well as some rather explicit sex-scenes (and you will even notice that some scenes and aspects clearly were the blueprints of scenes later to be shot for Verhoeven's BASIC INSTINCT). Another aspect this movie has is a lot of symbolism and biblical references/images which supposedly made the film thoroughly hated by some conservative/catholic movements at the time of its European release. Either way it makes the movie worthy of a second viewing. Now someone recently told me he had grave misgivings about DE VIERDE MAN. One of them being that the film supposedly manoeuvers itself into a position where it needs the divine intervention of the Virgin Mary to resolve itself. I myself have big issues with the way Catholicism has been and still is sometimes portrayed in many movies in any genre (so not only when it comes to religiously themed horror movies). But surprisingly I had no misgivings whatsoever when it comes to THE FOURTH MAN. Although the Virgin Mary-aspect in the plot did make me scratch my head at one point I also had fun with it in a way. I think the keyword as to why it didn't bother me at all is 'duality'. Because this movie works on two levels. Although 'divine intervention' might have resolved the plot-line from the protagonist's point of view... on the other hand: the movie implies that all this might have been the delirious ramblings of a raving madman. And that's the fun part: You never know for sure. And then there's the question: Could it be that Gerard Reve was somehow receiving distorted visions of things to come... like receiving omens? At one point in the movie Gerard even tries to fool Christine into believing he is clairvoyant. The way he is playing Christine in that particular scene is exquisite to behold. So with its compelling story convincing acting performances and adequate direction DE VIERDE MAN is a very much recommended viewing indeed (especially if you enjoy a solid European psychological horror film). But make sure you see the original Dutch version (not the dubbed one). ,pos
 I picked up this video after reading the text on the box the story seemed good and it had Keanu Reeves! But after 5 minutes of watching I noticed how horrible his acting was he walks and talks so stupid the whole time it's fake and not convincing. It doesn't end there almost ALL the characters act so badly it's laughable the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce (David) but the guy commits suicide early on and you don't see him again you never even know why he did it! Everything about this movie screams low quality I can't believe how such a thing gets released! I was tempted many times to stop watching in fact I did half way through it I decided to stop watching and turned the thing off came to the IMDB to check what other's thought about it I found zero comments (not surprised) so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it. The only good thing going (for me) was the high-school Rock band theme the occasional guitar playing and singing parts but that's not worth it. Very bad acting and directing... Terrible movie. ,neg
 Yet another venture into the realm of the teen-gross-out-comedy set on a college campus featuring a nerd's quest to coolness and how he decides to blackmail a trio of popular jocks into making him get the girl. It's all been done before and it's all been done in a far more satisfying manner. The gross-out humor that has made teen flicks like American Pie and Dude! Where's my Car so popular is taken completely out of context in this installment appearing so completely at random that the viewer can only frown and disapprove. The film is badly written and the actors never succeed in making any of it even slightly bearable. I won't even dignify this terrible picture by divulging as it's a waste of my time and yours. At best Slackers never manages to entertain or induce laughter and at worst it is excruciatingly bad and at times completely unwatchable. Jason Schwarzman who impressed in his debut Rushmore humiliates himself by appearing in this picture and one wonders how a career can end up in the toilet so fast. Please avoid please avoid. Save your money. ,neg
 I just finished watching guinea pig - Devils experiment. I have to say that this movie although having very good FX better then I expected was NOT a good movie. I honestly cant say that I enjoyed this movie at all. Of course It is effective in its way of being a shocking realistic twisted 43 minutes of torture but I found it to be very boring (and not as gory as i hoped). And also I found that the torturers were very annoying when they talked and loughed trying to sound tough all the time that ruined it even more (and Im sure there's some people out there who will agree with me on that one). I have now seen guinea pig 1 2 3 5 and the best one out of those in my opinion is guinea pig 2 - Flowers of the flesh and blood. I wont say much more about Devils experiment other than Great fx descent acting from the girl annoying fu**ing torturers overall I give it 4 stars on account of the FX cos they are awesome. ,neg
 Wow I knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad. Spoilerific comments ensue. Roddy Roddy Piper is sickly sweet retired cop (cliche!) helping out everyone - smiling like a post-op lobotomy patient through-out and lamenting over his dead son. His adopted son returns from Armed Forces Special Ops and because he's seen things - portrayed by clenching his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. Time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who the bad lad killed) and his adopted son. Oh the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the ex-Army bloke. This happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene. The action could have saved this film but it's even worse than the storyline and acting. It's all been done before it's all been done much much better (Ong-Bak is a prime example). This is the worst film I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld twice. Erm the film is called HONOR (Spelt Wrong for the Americans) and the tag line has from the makers of Bloodsport and Kickboxer - check out Director David Worths other films and you'll soon realise why they put these 2 films on there even though they are over 10 years old. Such classics as Shark Attack 3: Megalodon - says it all really. I'll give you Â£10 if you don't go to see this film. PS - Apologise for not know character names tells you something though. ,neg
 I saw this movie the first time at about twelve o'clock on a Saturday evening. It really is the perfect time for this one. I have never EVER seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes. If you want to see a thrilling action movie don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through. However if you want a good laugh please watch it! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my enjoyable Saturday night. What especially struck me is that Ã©very scene that would be expensive to make was copy-pasted from a Discovery documentary or an old TV-special on the US Army. Furthermore I was amazed by the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort in making the production look real. Afghanistan is as far as I can remember nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click Deke escapes from the terrorists sand-castle with his jet-pack and is taken away by a submarine (probably Discovery). Later on in the movie Deke throws an Islam terrorist against the wall. In the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the Korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall. Gotta love it. I recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though only then you'll understand why I've been mad enough to spend 6 99 euro's on the box. ,neg
 Disney? What happened? I really wish the movie had been set in the 60's ;like the book was. And I really could have dealt with cheap special effects in order to save the budget for a more accurate adaption..... I'm glad that maybe someone might be influenced to read the books..... but The Man With Red Eyes interchangeable as IT? And what's up with the volcanic upheaval? Where was THAT in the book? Peter Jackson! Save us!!!! A long time ago (1978) I heard that there was European version of this film. I sure wish I could id it. I can only imagine it might be closer to the real story than this poor adaption. This movie needs to be X'd. ,neg
 The lovely Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding her. Richter plays Anna an out-of-work independent-minded somewhat neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchair-bound muted aged father named Walentin (the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth who died at 77 shortly after this film was made). SPOILER ALERT Walentin refuses to respond to anyone --until he confronts the gifted Anna whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old battered devil back from a self-imposed death sentence. Writer/director/actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son (Jorgen played by Clausen) has loving a father who has never accepted him. The film sags toward the end but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia the nature and value of loving and caring and how one person the irrepressible Anna can alter the course of a human life. Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance is alone worth the price of admission. ,pos
 The statistics in this movie were well researched. There is no doubt about it! Al Gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got. Al Gore is certainly quite an actor. He sounds so concerned. But actions speak louder than words! Throughout this movie there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie. Jimmy Carter unlike Al Gore is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk but walks the walk as well. When Carter thought we needed to conserve energy he turned down the thermostat in the White House and got warm by wearing a sweater. Al Gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet. How much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? How much energy does it take to heat Gore's swimming pool behind his mansion? It would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. But if we did the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a 50% loss in revenue and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%. So just turning it off would not be a very good idea. This movie is a veiled appeal to allow Big Goivernment to take control of everything in the name of saving planet earth that is. ,neg
 I was really horrified by this eerie movie. What an unusual dark atmosphere. And such a creepy musical score. Really promising! Indeed after ten minutes you really start sweating and feeling uncomfortable for you start fearing the worst. This movie has the atmosphere of a true nightmare and what's worse-it all comes out. For one hour and a half I have been trying to fight complete boredom and falling asleep but the monstrous soundtrack kept me awake. Nuit Noire is a truly horrifying picture - for your eyes your ears your intelligence and most of all: your wallet since the thought of spending precious money on a movie ticket for this cheap amateuristic homevideo is the biggest horror of all. ,neg
 This has to be hands down hats off one of the most uproarious comedies ever made. Starting with the animated blowing popping bubbles the entrance to the Daytime Awards the usual phony drivel spewed by the stars on the red carpet the rehearsed and badly acted acceptance speech the venomous comments uttered by the actor's jealous co-stars and producer under phony smiles. Now THAT is only in the first few minutes. Then all hell breaks loose from there and it only gets more frantic and ridiculous. Ridiculous in a good way no make that a great way. This was the first time I'd seen the always charming Teri Hatcher. While I may not be a follower of Desperate Housewives she herself is always watchable - same goes for Lois & Clark. Not a huge follower but if I run across an episode I'd watch it. Robert Downey jr. does a great turn as slimy smarmy snaky sycophantic David Seaton Barnes the producer who'd give his right eye to see Sally Field's Celeste Talbert leave the show if only to finally get to get it on with Cathy Moriarty's Montana Moorehead. Moriarty absolutely shines in this movie just as she had everywhere else she's appeared. Here all she has to do is scream I HATE YOU I HATE YOU YOU CREEP! or give one of her anti-Celeste-co-conspirators an evil grin and she has me rolling in the aisles. Yes Cathy Moriarty is a very gifted actress and one hell of a comedienne. Sally Field gratefully departs from the usual 70-MM-sized Lifetime Tragedy of the Week movies and we're all reminded why she is who she is today having started off in comedy afraid of nothing. Her ensuing years of drama had hidden her sense of humor but like a caterpillar in a cocoon the brilliant comedienne she is had blossomed and it was joyous to see her as hilarious as she was. The thing with dramatic actors and actresses is that you see in such heavy serious roles that you associate them with their character and you can't believe it when you see them finally having some fun on screen. How lucky were the producers to land Carrie Fisher if only for a glorified cameo. She doesn't realize what a presence she bears on screen. She takes a role which in the hands of a lesser actress could easily have been forgotten but she owns the character and it seems as if she wrote it herself. How lucky was Elisabeth Shue to get thrown in the middle of all this! At the time she wasn't really known for much. Adventures in Babysitting was kind of cute (yes I was dragged to an evening show for which I had to pay full price) but she didn't hold my attention - - much. But here she makes the most of her character - star's niece who falls in love with the star's ex-co-star-and-lover who of course turns out to be the niece's father and the star turns out to be the poor girl's mother. I'll stop there - I feel I practically wrote a book about this brilliant screwball comedy or at least a novela. If you've seen it then reminisce. If you haven't you've missed a real classic but not really. The DVD's are made of a material that'll last for at least 25 years and this movie is timeless so what the hell. ,pos
 Are you kidding me?! A show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal? How talented do you have to be to do this? She MAY be able to cook but it is NOT portrayed in this half-hour stomach churning painful production. I know she has a Martha-Stewart-esquire empire. So does Warren Buffett but I don't see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and Alpo. She has a nephew named...Brycer. Brycer? Stop talking about anyone a name that stupid. More time is spent on table-scapes than actual cooking. Who has that kind of time?! Silicon should be on your spatula not on my TV. This show should be on Cartoon Network NOT Food Network. ,neg
 In an alternate 1950s where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'space-dust') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars a young loner Timmy finds a friend in Fido (Billy Connelly) his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie. Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife played by the gorgeous Carrie-Anne Moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father who tried to eat him!). Timmy runs into a spot of bother however when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. With the authorities on Fido's trail trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help will Timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend? A refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick Fido is a thoroughly entertaining deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. Taking the Romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town America is a stroke of genius and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that I have seen. Connelly's Fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame along with Day Of The Dead's Bub and Return Of The Living Dead's Tarman; it is not often I feel empathy for a walking corpse but The Big Yin's performance is so fine that I actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the cast also give commendable performances with young K'Sun Ray (as Timmy) and Ms.Moss deserving special mentionsÂ—Ray because for one so young he puts in a particularly assured turn and Moss because she is so bloody yummy! This is the third zombie film that I have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun Flight Of The Living Dead) and to my surprise it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future. 8.5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for IMDb. ,pos
 So Todd Sheets once stated that he considers his 1993 shot-on-video Z-epic Zombie Bloodbath to be his first feature film. Anyone who's ever seen a little beauty called Zombie Rampage knows exactly how untrue that statement is. I mean what makes this one that much more superior? Well then again Zombie Rampage doesn't include that mullet guy now does it? For one to comprehend exactly why Zombie Bloodbath is actually considered worth a damn one must remember what the 90's were like for lovers of bad horror. A decade that all but said goodbye to B and Z-cinema as we knew it. Technological advances awkward trends and the internet would abolish the mysterious charms of the s.o.v.'s big-boxed golden years. And anything remotely resembling quality schlock was all too self-aware for it's own good basically defeating the purpose. Luckily not everyone changes with the times. Enter Zombie Bloodbath. And I guess this is the part where I explain the same exact premise from 500 other zombie flicks from the last 40 years. Alright so Some kind of accident at a nuclear plant infects everyone in sight turning them into flesh-eating zombies who go on a rampage inflicting some of the most gruesome yet humorous gore-scenes of the 90's. The first 20 minutes are cluttered with the most awkward-sounding conversations you could imagine. Conversations that let you know that this isn't just a low-budget zombie flick this is a Z-grade disasterpiece fella. plenty Hysterical non-existent acting to go around and that goes triple for Mr. Mullet. That guy is truly the highlight of the night. The fact that Todd Sheets seriously considers Zombie Bloodbath to be THAT superior to Zombie Rampage amuses me to no end. I mean really both are complete jokes on celluloid but then again so is Redneck Zombies so obviously Todd Sheets is in the company of awsomeness. By 1993 a movie this bad would no doubt be a full-blast spoof but Mr. Sheets stands his ground giving us some good old fashion schlock the way it was meant to be unaware clueless and pointless. God bless Todd Sheets. For anyone seeking surprisingly worthwhile 90's B-Horror Leif Jonker's Darkness should be at the top of your list. As for Zombie Bloodbath if you're a gorehound who got bored sometime around 1990 then '93 would be the perfect time to pick up. 8/10 ,pos
 I have recently watched this movie twice and I can't seem to understand why the h*ll the makers made this pile of crap. I mean yes It gives a great impression of Hitler's environment and I mean the way they reproduced Austria in the late 1890's WWI and the Inter-war period. What I can't understand is why they pictured Hitler as a 100% pure evil mad unreliable mentally unstable freak. He was after all a very thoughtful loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides no doubt about that. But why in heaven's name portray him in this way? All of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario leaving nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever. Yes he threw Germany into the devastating 2nd World War. Yes he was racist and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war. All true. But again; why the hell did they plain LIE to the public? To warn us? I absolutely don't think this movie was a warning. The true danger of Hitler and the Nazi's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness. The fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every German alive (not to mention Austrians and a LOT of other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization NOT the fact Hitler was such a 'weirdo'. If it would have been like the makers make us believe - I would have been convinced that the German people were retarded. A man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader - not to mention ReichsKanzler. 4/10 ,neg
 Sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands (Wayne's World the first one not the second). But most often they have duds (It's Pat comes to mind rather quickly). This time out it's Tim Meadows as The Ladies Man. This movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud. It was very funny for the first 20 minutes but then as usually happens with SNL skits it starts to slow down before finally ending long after it should have. Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps a radio DJ with a nightly show called The Ladies Man. He answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships usually in the crudest way possible. Everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt. After pushing the buttons of the station manager Leon along with his producer Julie (Karyn Parsons) gets fired and needs to find another job. Out of the random blue comes a letter from one of his ex-ladies. The letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life the only problem being that the letter isn't signed. So Leon needs to track down all the women he's been with to find the woman of his dreams. But sometimes as Billy Dee Williams says in the film the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you. There is also a sub-plot about a bunch of guys who's wives/girlfriends have all slept with Leon and they want to first figure out who he is (by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy) then kill him. Leading this bunch of guys is surprise! Will Ferrell from SNL. First off I thought the sub-plot was rather lame. The singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless. I usually like Will Ferrell but here he just never clicked for me. And the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along and in the end all decided that having their wives/girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault. So back to the main story. The story basically centers around Leon and sex. So what it comes down to is if you don't like the character of Leon you won't like the movie. His voice his mannerisms his dialogue is what carries the movie. I am not a big fan of Tim Meadows. I never thought he was a particularly good actor on SNL. The only thing I ever really liked of his was his Ladies Man skits. But the best thing about those is that they usually involved the guest host (remember the one with Cameron Diaz?) and they were short. For about 5 minutes they were pretty funny. And here for about 20 minutes it's really funny. What I thought was good about the character in the movie is that he stayed in character throughout. He never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona. Until right at the end where there was this transformation and the ever present speech to tie things up. Other than that it was pretty good at keeping Leon as Leon and not changing him into something less crude than he was. There isn't a lot of substance to this movie if you couldn't guess. But like I said earlier the beginning of the movie I found to be very funny. Some real laugh out loud moments all revolving around sex and his crudeness. The problem of course with this movie and most other SNL spin offs is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time. Stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult. That difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub-plot because without it this movie would have been a little under an hour. When it was good it was good but when it wasn't good it got to be boring. So overall The Ladies Man wasn't as bad as other SNL films but it wasn't as good as others. It had some funny moments the first 20 minutes was pretty good but the rest of it dragged on. There was an unnecessary sub-plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film. The bottom line is if you like Tim Meadows and his Leon Phelps character you'll be able to watch the film. If he annoys you don't even bother going. Unless you just want to see Tiffani Theissen in some nice revealing clothing. ,pos
 Well I like to be honest with all the audiences that I bought it because of Kira's sex scenes but unfortunately I did not see much of them. All sex scenes were short and done in haphazard manner along with all the weird and corny background music just like all other B movies - it just doesn't look much like two people having sex. There is a tiny bit of plot toward the end - Kira's new lover is a killer. Whoa!!! how shocking!!! Why don't we nominate this movie for Oscar Award? I can't imagine how bad the movie would look like if it were R-rated (Mine is imported from UK rated 18). Conclusion? Put it down and walk away so yon won't end up with being a moron like me. Score: 2/10 ,neg
 I picked this film up based on the plot summary and critics' quotes on the back of the box. I'm not big into foreign films and didn't know what to expect. I don't really care for subtitles either. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple lovable quality that leaves you feeling good about life. I found myself laughing out loud repeatedly. I'd recommend this picture to anyone even those who abhor foreign films with subtitles. This one makes it worth the effort. ,pos
 I never much liked the Myra movie tho I appreciate how it pushed the Hollywood envelope at the time. Certainly Miss Welch's costume became an iconic image though I have to wonder if many people who recognize the image really saw the film and know what it was all about - I rewatched Myra on FMC a couple of years ago and didn't think it had aged any better thru the years. There's a segment about it in the Sexploitation Cinema Cartoon History comic books where it's given proper credit for putting such big stars in what was then an outrageous production. However IMHO the movie is too bitter to be charming too silly to be a turn-on and so busy trying to shock that it fails to inform engage OR entertain --- ,neg
 I don't know what the rest of you guys watch Steven Seagal movies for but I watch them because as silly as they are they're at least always good for a laugh. Why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of? Attack Force is by no means a great movie but I felt it was as worthy a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other movies; in fact I didn't think it was one of his worst by a long-shot. It had most of the time a half-way coherent plot line and it was most of the time fundamentally exciting. The ending really sucked but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements. In the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised but I actually thought that the acting characterization (if I may use such a big word) and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect. Seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone-faced no-nonsense man's man that we've come to expect and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well without ever up-staging him. This people is what a Steven Seagal movie does. Deal with it. Or even better: laugh at it. 4 out of 10. ,neg
 It's hard to tell if Noonan and Marshall are trying to ape Abbott & Costello Martin & Lewis Curley & Larry or some other comedy team but whoever it was they were trying to imitate they failed miserably. There's barely one weak laugh in this whole incredibly stupid picture. Noonan (who helped write the alleged script ) and Marshall have no chemistry whatsoever; Marshall seems to be trying for a Dean Martin type of devil-may-care coolness but he doesn't come even remotely close. God knows what Noonan thought he was doing but being funny sure wasn't it. He seems to think that flapping his arms and legs a lot and staring dumbly at everyone and everything is the height of screen comedy; maybe for him it is but not for the audience. I remember seeing this in the theaters when it came out. It was on the bottom of a double bill with a three-year-old Jeff Chandler western ( Pillars of the Sky which was pretty good) and a Three Stooges short ( Sappy Bullfighters which wasn't) and about 20 minutes into this thing all the kids in the audience were throwing stuff at the screen; it was so staggeringly unfunny that it didn't even measure up to the worst of the Three Stooges shorts. I stayed around for the end of it (not that I wanted to but my folks weren't due to pick me up until after the movie ended) and by the time this mess was over I was the only one in the theater. I saw it again about 15 or so years ago on cable one night and stuck around to watch it to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was worse. The only thing it had going for it was Julie Newmar who was as smokingly hot as ever; other than her this thing has absolutely NOTHING to recommend it. The two of them also play Japanese soldiers and the way they do it makes Jerry Lewis' infamous playing of Japanese characters as thick-lensed buck-toothed gibbering mental defectives look benign by comparison. Marshall went on to host Hollywood Squares and Noonan kept trying his hand at making movies but most of them were almost as bad as this. Not quite though as I don't think ANYTHING could be quite as bad as this. A truly pathetic waste of film. Don't waste your time on it. ,neg
 When you look at this now and hear all the language in here it's amazing this was rated PG but that's the 1970s rating system for you. Peter Falk spews out the Lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! Yet few people consider that offensive and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who rate them. The cast is a clue to how profane this film can be: Falk Peter Boyle Allen Garfield Warren Oates Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino aren't exactly actors you wouldn't find in The Sound Of Music. I like heist movies and a lot of films by director William Friedkin but this script doesn't deliver and it just has way too much of the Sleazy '70s feel to it visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in TV's Columbo it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films. This is far from the only case. ,neg
